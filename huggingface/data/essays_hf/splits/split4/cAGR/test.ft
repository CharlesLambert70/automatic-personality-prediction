__label__label0 Ok. Here we go. Well I really don't have much to say right now. I've done this type of writing before. It was a strange experience. All I ended up writing was the lyrics to some song I couldn't get out of my head. I just kept going over and over again. Don't you hate that?  I especially hate it when it's like some obnoxious song that I only know the chorus to or something. Hmmm. Right now I’m wondering how in the world I’m supposed to keep on typing for twenty minutes and keep on coming up with things to say. It's kind of like when you meet someone new and you're trying to have a conversation with them and you keep hitting those brick walls. I constantly do that. You can only ask a person their major so many times. I wish I would have taken a typing class in high school. Everyone else I know did but I procrastinated so I could only take a programming class for my computer credit. But it was good that I took that class. Now I’ve learned that I really do hate programming. I have to come to terms with the fact that I like computers yet I hate programming. I think my brain would slowly build up pressure and then explode when I’m in my 00s if I became a programmer. My typing skills are atrocious!  I think I’ve been out of practice. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing?  She's my roommate and she's sitting next to me. She always gets a lot of e-mail, yet she complains regularly that no one writes her. I like get nothing but that could be because I don't write anyone either. Oh well. I think if I got into the e-mail habit again, I would waste way too much time in the computer lab anyway. Oh no. Mind block. This is kind of like writing a letter to your closest friend. (which I also haven't done in a while. )  Just say whatever an who cares if they care or not. What are you guys going to do with this information anyway??  I missed the first day of class so I really don't know how this stuff is going to be used. I've always been afraid that if I ever went to a psychologist or something, that they would end up telling me that I’m nuts or something. Or they would know something about me that I really don't want them to know. And there's a lot of that kind of stuff. Everyone in this room is staring blankly into the screen of their computers. Isn't it amazing the power these little boxes of silicon and metal have over us?  Imagine our world today without computers. (apparently I actually learned something from my comp sci class here)  If one day all computers just stopped working, we would all be screwed. The world would go haywire. I would go nuts. And don't limit it to the computer in the traditional sense. We're talking the little computer chip in your remote control or in your light fixtures. Everything. Hey. that would make a good story. I bet it's been done before but I think I just inspired myself. That'll be my second movie. Did I say I wanted to be a director?  Well I do. Now I have three ideas for my first films. I really can't wait. I need to go out and buy some books. I've been running out of things to read. I love books. Actually I have a new favorite author. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That reminds me I need to look him up on the web. I wonder if he's written anything else??  I hope so. "Vurt"  was one of the best books I’ve ever read. Well, times up. :) 
__label__label1 I've done alot of self-analysis lately. I realize a few things about myself. I'm a bit obsessive and I believe that may hinder the growth of my current relationship The person I started dating is a wonderful guy, but I take all the small things to heart His dealing with a alot of coming out issues and that makes it much harder on him. The  nature of the relationship itself is freaky even for me here is this guy. I've been  best friends with him for three years now. He and I have been roommates for about two years and it's like all of a sudden the doors of our relationship have flown open. He is now doing things that before I didn't imagine with him. He was a friend now he's something. Do I want this? Yes, I guess. I have talk to numerous people about  this, like PROPNAME. She is a wonderful friend. Her whole entire existence revolves around  one thing right now. Sex! It seems to be a common search for people our age. What if you settle for less, because emotionally that person is so well suited to you. Is that bad or good. I view that as okay. I need reach within myself and learn whether or not. Settling  for less is good or bad. I do know one thing. I do great work, when motivated. I become more goal orientated lately. Setting one tasks and completing it well. It is time consuming  but I believe it will be more beneficial to those I serve. I've been struggling to pick a major  and right now I don't know. I'm so lost I really just need some direction. This school year  has just been really confusing. My whole life has changed in a matter of one month, but I'm happier. Happiness is really a weird word. I think sometimes it just adding a little bit of energy to a  doomed project. Who knows time to reconsider my thought and self image. Life would be easier,  if there wasn't some guy up there scrambling our thoughts. I don't believe in a higher being, but  maybe there is a higher bean. hehehehe!!!! I used to believe in God then during some "clarity" I thought who would do right by making animals who feed off of each other. Either emotionally,  physically or mentally, finding those symbiotic relationships I guess is one of life's little hills we must all conquer. I love life! 
__label__label0 Well, I'm in my boyfriend's room typing this. I'm pretty sleepy too, I'm in  Longhorn band, so I had practice last night until about 0:00. Then I went  to a freshman meeting and decided to run for freshman representative. Believe  it or not, I actually won. It surprised me a lot because I don't know anyone. I've met lots of people, but I don't really have any good friends there. It makes  me really happy. I feel like I can now establish myself there and be a  leader in ORGNAME. This assignment is pretty weird because I really do write like this in my spare time. Whenever I get stressed, I usually grab a notebook and just write  everything that comes to mind. This is different though, it's a little harder to type your feelings. It somehow loses some emotion or something. There's really not much stress in my life right now, except the usual  going to college stuff, but I'll write about that later. My French horn teacher was really mean to me on Wednesday. He's this  little old man that looks kind of like PROPNAME. He always wears bolo ties and well, he's just a little jerk. He enjoys watching his students cry and have emotional breakdowns. We'll see!  I've never let him see me cry and I never will. I think he sees me as a challenge. I mean, he's really talented and of coarse I have lots of respect for him. I just don't  understand why he enjoys hurting people so much. There is a picture of my boyfriend and me on the wall. I like it. (I actually look decent in it) I always look ugly in pictures. I have this  friend that always comes out pretty in pictures. I'm jealous. Well, I've surpassed my 00 minutes, so I better go. 
__label__label1   I am feeling a little hungry right now. What should I do? Go to Jester, go out to eat, make something here in the dorm. Maybe I should just go to the Union. Lets see, I will change clothes and go shower or something. I'll get my comb and toothbrush and go to the restroom. What do I wear to go out tonight?  I think I will wear my white Polo shirt and my black shorts. No I'll wear my khaki shorts and my white tennis shoes. I can't stay out to long since I have so much homework to do. The entire English rough draft to do, my pre-calculus, and all my psychology reading to do. Man, I feel sleepy, guess I should have gone to bed early last night instead of watching PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Maybe I'll just come back and sleep after my biology class tomorrow. I wonder what is on T. V. right now. It's mostly just the news. Good! Entertainment Tonight is on now. Hope it's a good show. Let me start washing up and changing my clothes for supper. I don't think it will rain again so I guess I don't need my umbrella tonight. I wonder how much I will have to do tomorrow. I still need to go draw my tickets for the Longhorn game on Saturday. I hope the seats are better than last time. 
__label__label0 Okay, I've begun writing. One thing I should probably point out as I recall  the above statement about disregarding grammar is that I spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as I type are  second nature to me, so it's not like I've gone back and fixed all the errors. Which doesn't mean that there probably aren't any run on sentences in here. Okay. That's been said. Right now my roommate is being fairly loud. I find that bothersome. I'm not sure if he's stupid or inconsiderate. I'd rather be at home right now. I was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now I'm having trouble getting the motivation to do anything. It made the summer more fun at the time, but it was maybe not such a good idea. Ideas are like that because of that whole 00/00 hindsight thing. I'm looking at the vents on the side of my computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gills. I'm not looking forward to having to do the other  writing assignment. Which is not to say I think it'll be difficult, but this assignment requires almost no discipline. The other one will require me to  have directed thought, and that's not really that big a deal, but it's one thing to sit down ready to do a task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long you're supposed to be doing it. What I mean to say is that the time will seem to pass more slowly because I'll be watching the clock, so  I'll probably be more bored, and I don't like to be bored. I'm not very far into this but my train of thought seems to have stopped. Probably because my roommate(or actually suitemate; I have a room to myself but share a refrigerator, microwave and two bathrooms with two other guys)keeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly. It wouldn't be so bad if he'd just shut his door, but for some reason he hasn't thought of  that. They've wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of my door now. Now they seem to have left, so maybe I can concentrate. No, that didn't work. I've found it previously difficult to make my mind blank intentionally, but now it seems to come quite easily. I think probably I'm tired. The cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at my home, so when there's nothing else to do I usually watch something like Comedy Central late at night and shave a few hours off of a healthy amount of sleep. That's better; time's passing quickly now. Which I normally wouldn't like, but this is something I wouldn't have done if it wasn't a grade(no offense to anyone involved in this research)and when you're forced to do something you want it to end quickly. I think the air conditioning in this dorm is screwed up. It's hot right now, and I had to buy a fan earlier to keep it semi-cool in my room. It doesn't work all the time. Like right now. The fan's blowing on me, but I'm not cool. There he goes again. I think my roommate's playing 'Sympathy for the Devil' now. Which isn't so bad, because that's a good song. I tried to learn the piano once, but I didn't stay on it for very long. I found that the teacher was really good for nothing, because I could learn everything she taught from the book itself. But when I stopped going to lessons I found too many other things to occupy my time, and stopped practicing. I would have liked to have been able to play the keyboard parts in several Rolling Stones songs. And several other of the 'older' bands' songs. Most modern music is pretty much no good. And that brings an end to my twenty minutes. 
__label__label1 I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an "A" we should try to learn something for a change in LOCNAME instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 0:00? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 00 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad. She probably wouldn't want me though because I'm black. Who gives a fuck. In the goat ass. Colin's here he's hungry. BEEr dance naked bitches oops I can't stand ugly women unless they are with good-looking ones. Kiss me PROPNAME. What if your nipples were on your forehead? Piss on me I'm a dickfor. Who knows why we are here. Who's going. In a bloodbath of  sweat spot you later hey borrow my card bitch. Please give me an A. I'm a psycho. If you think I'm crazy meet Colin.

__label__label0 Right now I am having a weird feeling in the lower part of my stomach. I'm not sure if I just had a bad lunch or if it may be something a little more serious. I'm kind of sad too. I talked to my family earlier and I realized how much I missed being at home. Last night I attempted to meet some new people despite the fact that I am just not the social type so I am kind of down about that too. I hate walking up and down the stairs and stuff here at u. t. I can't stand the heat. I mean I am from the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME but I never had to walk EVERYWHERE. I hate the food in Jester. I know I wasn't supposed to talk about this until my second assignment, but right now college controls most of what I am thinking right now. I forgot, keep typing, keep typing. In a sense this stream of consciousness isn't as relaxed or real as one might assume it may be. A lot of the thoughts are a little forced because you would have to put your thoughts into words. That itself isn't too natural. I am not a computer person either. I guess it could be worse and I could be an EXTREMELY slow typer as well. Phew. You know, this isn't so bad. It's kind of fun. This assignment simply requires that you ramble for twenty minutes. It's kind of quiet in here. I just realized that. My fingernails are really short. I wish they could be a little longer. a little more feminine. One day I wake up and they are on their way to getting long and the next day I wake up and I've either pulled on or bit them. Even though I am not really the social type, I have managed to make some friends. yea for me. this guy in front of me looks like he's all into his homework when I bet he's just e-mailing his chick back home. Even though I just used the word "chick" I am not sexist. In fact, I  hate that word. I'm not exactly into all this equal rights stuff. I think it is okay for men to play the macho, take charge role in society. I mean, women are, as an entirety , weaker. So what if we are the ones who play the nurturing half of the species?  We have our strong points and so do men. It balances out. Every once and a while you get a person who is stronger in a different and/or unnatural area, but that is fine with me too. There are a lot of computers in this room. While I typed that I had another thought but I can't type 0 things at once so you just missed out on something. of course it wasn't important so who really cares?  bop bop bop bop my brain stopped throwing out ideas just then. My friends are sitting to each side of me. I haven’t talked to them since I started this assignment so it feels weird. Oh, wait. I had to talk to one briefly about why this thing typed all the way down to what seemed infinity until it returned to the next line. She just told me to wait. Everyone says you gain fifteen pounds when you get to college. I hope that is not true because I already feel fat enough as it is. So, have you sat down for twenty minutes and tried this assignment?  How did it turn out for you?  This is a pretty big screen. Pretty big, indeed. I'm pretending to type fast. I hit keys and everyone probably thinks I'm on a role with what I am thinking, when in reality I am just pretending. Crazy, huh. Wouldn't it be weird if I just snapped and from here on out everything I thought was as random and crazy as this. this isn't a personality profile is it? You aren't going to call me in some time and discharge me from UT are you?  I guess this isn't what you had in mind for stream of consciousness (I don’t want to spell it takes too much brain power) but I hope its kind of what I was supposed to do. I am one of those students who is always scared of turning in assignments because they might be just plain wrong. I'm really tires of typing. I just read what I typed "I’m really 'tires' of typing" that's pretty stupid. at least I know I am not one of those people who thinks a bunch of bad words when I am freethinking. Or at least I don’t think about sex or anything. Well, I did talk about men and women and equal rights so I guess that kind of applies. When I play with the keyboard it sounds kind of like a horserace. Try it, it does. All you have to do is establish a rhythm. My fingers hurt still. I wish I was really fluent in another language. type, I don’t want to type. type I don’t want to type. believe it or not those words just took the form as a song in my head. I cheated. I just talked to my friends sitting next to me. I BROKE. again. I think I went a little over but this has been kind of fun.   
__label__label1 I really don't know how to use the Internet and I have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant I am. I really wish that I did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like I will really have to use it in medicine. I wish my dad would subscribe t o the Internet at home. Oh well at least during the Christmas vacation I probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. I wish my dad had not held me to that deal, I mean what if I flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. Forget the car I just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the Christmas holiday just incase I fail. You know I am really scared what if I really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get  into medical school and I happen to fail, what if I became a doctor and all my patients died on me will I be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. I really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so I can see what courses I should be taking and when I can fit them in so I can graduate in four years. You know what this is a stupid assignment because I am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. Mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. You know if I had been a braver soul I would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. What kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to Mrs. whitenight I cant believe I didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, I suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. I mean really since I suffered and improved each and every day in her class I should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what I could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score It sounds really silly, but who cares I don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and You know Mrs. PROPNAME should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair I mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. This is almost over thank you God I never want to do this again but I have to. Yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad I cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing I have friends like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I still haven’t talked to PROPNAME and I could  not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from PROPNAME the nerve of her trying to steal my major. I mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to PROPNAME she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than I am. I can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction I am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and I can get me a tutor so I can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. I hope I beat enough so that I graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( I could care less). PROPNAME is a cool roommate , I sort of getting a little tired of jean I mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend I hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. Today I am supposed to start jogging I hope I can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself I think. I know I have to call my parents I am especially worried about my mom I mean ever since the death of Princess PROPNAME she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone I hope she gets over it soon. I hope when I am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, I can't believe PROPNAME and PROPNAME got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift I have received from anyone since I got my ORGNAME' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that  was the last birthday I got present from my parents at all. You know in the two weeks I have been here I have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because I think I was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. Maybe I'll see him during the Christmas holiday maybe I wont maybe I'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way I shouldn't be thinking about that right now I'll think about it later when I am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really read this its not embarrassing I just don't feel like having anyone analyzing my brain waves or my mind thinking pattern, I would rather be analyzing someone else myself. I wonder what the projects are going to like I hope its going to great well I have to go so I can eat lunch which I have never wanted more than right now. 
__label__label1 I do not know what to write about for twenty minutes. It took me so long to get a computer at this place, and I would like to E-mail my best friend in LOCNAME since I never get to see her. Well, I guess this is the coolest assignment that I have had so far since it doesn't require any thinking- well, it actually does. in fact, that's all this assignment is about. But, I mean it is not hard. I am really worried about my classes this semester. I feel like I have been going to school here for a while, but it has only been a week. I have a lot of reading to do. I think my classes are not too hard, but I KNOW THAT THEY WILL GET HARDER, I JUST HOPE THAT I DO WELL. Oops, I just turned the caps lock key, sorry!  Well, I am now thinking about what I should eat for dinner. I am also thinking that I don't want to gain the freshman-00. I eat pretty healthy food in the cafeteria, but I eat a lot more than I did at home. but I guess since all of my classes are miles away from each other, I will be OK. My boyfriend is coming to see me sometime soon, I wish that he was here right now. I hope that he is doing OK because I wonder about him. He's always changing his mind about our whole relationship- whether he thinks it will work out or not. One minute, he is all for it, and another, he thinks it will never work because we are too far away from each other. Anyway, all I know is that I really care about him, and that I have to leave the rest up to God to figure out. I feel really exhausted right now because I only got 0 hours of sleep last night, and then I woke up and went to class after a cup of coffee, something I think I'll have to get used to drinking now that I am here. that's one thing I really miss about College Station, though (even though there can't possibly be that much to miss in a town like that except for the people)  I miss the Java shakes I used to get at Sweet PROPNAME's, this coffee house I love so much. I thought that by coming to LOCNAME, I would surely find a replacement for the Java shake, with all of the many coffee houses here, but I have yet to find something to beat it. Although I did find this shake called a "Skinny Banana Espresso Shake" at a coffee house on the drag called LOCNAME. My really good friend PROPNAME and I go there every Friday now to get one- it's like one of our new little Austin rituals, so we can make sure to stay close by seeing each other once in a while, and making an outing of it. It's really weird though how people you least expect to get so close to, you end up not being able to live without seeing!  PROPNAME and I haven't ever been this close, but lately, we have so much in common. I just hope this isn't one of those "since you're from my hometown, let's be best friends until I meet some other people" kind of thing. Ok I have about six minutes left,  this is actually pretty cool, getting to know how my mind works and all. I already realize how many different topics my mind changes to in just 00 short minutes. I wish my mind did not wander off so many times, because that's really not good for my grades. Like sometimes in class, I will sit there thinking of my boyfriend instead of listening. But, then I go back to paying attention until I start wondering how my dog is doing all alone at home. Well, actually, I haven't thought about my dog during a class yet, but it could happen. Besides, I wanted to bring her up in some way in this little writing experiment, and that was the best way that I could think of. Anyway, as I was saying, I really hope that my dog does not die early since it is do lonely right now. My mom says she just sits on the staircase waiting for somebody to come home- that would be me or my brother. Ok, now I am thinking about me brother, who is the sweetest guy on earth. I hope that he is doing Ok right now. I thought that now that we live in the same city and all, we would actually get to see each other more, but we are so busy, I really don't get to see him until the weekends. Anyway, I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here to help me out. For example, I wouldn't have even known about this big computer lab. well, I am sure that I would have found out somehow, but I didn't have to find out myself. I mean, I don't want to be all dependent on him or anything, but I learn a lot from him, and I learn a lot on my own, too. Well, I think that my twenty minutes are up now. So maybe I will submit this and E-mail my friend PROPNAME. Or, maybe I won't. 
__label__label1 I am in PROPNAME's room right now using her internet-I hope she doesn't care. I get really frustrated with computes sometimes. I wish I understood them better. I only like Email. I like Email because I can talk to my friends in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can't wait until I get to see them on my birthday. I hope they are just as excited as I am. PROPNAME is talking about her boyfriend. Everyone has a boyfriend here in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Alot of them are far away though. I guess that would be pretty hard to deal with. If I really liked someone far away I would be really sad here. LOCNAMEt night was really fun. I had a good time with my friends. Sixth street is always fun because there are such a variety of people there. One of these nights I am going to sing karyoke. Then maybe someone will discover me and I'll become famous. I think my friend PROPNAME will be famous someday. Je and PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They are so awesome--I can't wait to see them. I wonder what will happen with PROPNAME. I keep wondering about him. He has a girlfriend, but she is depressed and she brings him down. Maybe I'll learn more about her depression in this class. I just hope he's happy. PROPNAME is not happy with PROPNAME right now--she really lied to him and PROPNAME. They are trying to get revenge now. They wrote a letter about her and they are going to put it up in the restaurant where she works. It's pretty mean and I bet she'll be really embarrassed. I told PROPNAME that revenge is a scary thing because it can consume you. He said "I know, but I've never been so furious in my life. " I feel sorry for him because I know he really liked her. I warned him though. I knew the second I met her that she was up to no good. She came between two best friends and she didn't even care. I wonder how my friends at schools far away are doing. I think PROPNAME, at LOCNAME is doing really well. She has made two "soul-mates" from Las LOCNAME. I bet they are so crazy on the dance floor! I miss PROPNAME--especially dancing with her. She is so much fun. I guess I'll see her on OU weekend. Then I can tell her all about my trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME will be home from LOCNAME, too. I can't wait to see her either. I hope she's been behaving herself. She breaks a lot of hearts. Her mom is really lonely by herself, I know she can't wait for PROPNAME to come home. I bet their phone bill is very expensive. I hope mine is not too bad. I've talked to PROPNAME and PROPNAME several times. I'm so glad I talked to PROPNAME though. We really confessed a lot to each other, It was good to get some of those things off of my chest. The situation is pretty good right now, I hope PROPNAME doesn't make the situation worse--if he is a real friend he will encourage PROPNAME like he said he would. I think my friend LOCNAME in LOCNAME is miserable. He has never really been his own person-- he relies too much on other people for his identity and now he knows no one a t school, He will really grow from this experience though. I should call him, but then again ===That phone bill! That (the save in $) is the good thing about Email. I can always send him regular mail, too. I like real mail. You can write your true feelings so much easier in a letter. That is why I like to write PROPNAME, 
__label__label1 I finally got all of my Ethernet problems worked out today, so I e-mailed  everyone I know. I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 00 disk but I also received my PROPNAME  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm glad  I got a card from PROPNAME today, looks like she's having a good time at ORGNAME. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in LOCNAME, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in LOCNAME and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the ORGNAME game November, PROPNAME doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise I’d write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see PROPNAME then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that I’m getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap. I wish I had some nail polish remover, I need to repaint my toenails. I wonder if I can make it through three weeks before I need to get my nails redone. I hope so I don’t want to change manicurists, I like PROPNAME. 
__label__label1   It has taken me a few minutes to get the hang of things. Meaning, I didn't know the steps in getting set up to use the computer because I really have never had that much experience in using the computer. I went to set my e-mail account  yesterday and also got my IF account number. Let me see what else comes in mind I have no idea but to keep typing. Oh ya here with me is PROPNAME who is a senior and is helping me get to know my way around campus and also answering any questions I have over school. I am planning to go to the football game this weekend I am still not sure, because my friends don't know if they would rather go to  the football game or go home to LOCNAME for the weekend. I myself would rather go to the game. I almost forgot that I have to go to my apartment and clean up and then I have to go to the bookstore to return a book that I don't need. Well what else can I write about. . my twenty minutes are almost up but not quite yet. . . I am here staring at other people in the room looking for familiar faces but I don't see one. . . . . Something that just came  to my head was that I really miss my family, especially my mom. My sisters,  and brother mean a lot to me too, oh ya my nephew also is someone I miss a  whole lot. He is the most adorable kid I have ever seen I not saying this  because he is my nephew but because it is true. Time up. 
__label__label0 I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 0 to 00 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 00 concert. I love PROPNAME so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. PROPNAME, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 0. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to LOCNAME to see everybody there and especially PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Mrs. PROPNAME, and of course PROPNAME. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. PROPNAME needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 0 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the ORGNAME win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up. 
__label__label0 I finally got into this thing. that took forever. I hate asking questions so it took even longer. I think people are always thinking weird things about me, which I know is bad , but I always do. the good thing is that everyone I've come in contact here has been really helpful. I really cant wait for this weekend. the weeks are so long. I haven’t made any new friends here. I have a lot friends that  came with me from high school to LOCNAME and to other schools in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I see them every weekend. I’m being really antisocial right now. the thing is that the friends I have are really close to me, and they know everything there is to know about me, and vice versa. I spent the last two years of my life with them, it may not seem like a lot but it was two very important years of my life. I feel really comfortable around them. I m not good at  meeting people so I cant imagine being at  the same level of friendship with other people especially in college where everyone just does their own thing. so I look forward to every weekend. people around me probably think I’m weird sitting here just typing continuously. I’m sure, actually I’m almost positive there are weirder people here. id really like to finish this already, but I just looked at the clock and I still have time left. I’m going home, back to LOCNAME LOCNAME next Friday. its going to be strange. I never expected to go back so soon. I was with this girl for about 0 months before I left, and it was really serious. we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. she was supposed to move here, but she had issues and commitments that were obviously more important. She cane to visit last month for about 0 weeks before school started. we got in  a big fight and she left on really bad terms. it was my fault, but I couldn’t have her leave on good terms or it would have hurt more. so I acted like a jerk and we fought the last week and a half she was here constantly. Anyway I’m really afraid of running into her, because ill be there for a whole weekend and we hang out a t the same places. I think its really funny how a lot of people here think LOCNAME LOCNAME is so small. its as big as LOCNAME, and no one knows it. ki heard someone say that they though it only had one high school. it actually has 00-00. oh well it rally doesn’t matter, I’m glad I’m here now. I really like it,  I cant believe I’m in college and actually grown up and that I actually have real responsibilities. but I very lonely. I miss her so much, and she wants to try the whole long distance relationship thing, but I cant. I really loved her. I've never been so close to anybody in my life, and after everything we shared and as close as we were, it seems like ill never experience that again with anybody. and if I do finally find someone and then we break up I have to go through this whole pain thing again. I know its normal to feel like this, I just moved away from a city I've lived in for 00 years and I just broke up with someone I was prepared to spend the rest of my life with, but its all a little overwhelming. the thing that bothers me the most is that all this takes up too many of my thoughts, and it takes away from what I really should be concentrating on. I really want  to do well here at LOCNAME, I have a lot to prove to a lot of people. I’m sick of always having this sob story attached to my life. I went to an all boys private school that was small compared to other high school, my graduating class was about 000. everyone knew that I moved out of my house and how I had trouble with my mom, and everyone feel sorry for me, and I’m sick of this whole drama thing, my life is so full of drama.  I went over by a few minutes I guess that’s all   
__label__label0 An open keyboard and buttons to push. The thing finally worked and I need not use periods, commas and all those thinks. Double space after a period. We can't help it. I put spaces between my words and I do my happy little assignment of jibber-jabber. Babble babble babble for 00 relaxing minutes and I feel silly and grammatically incorrect. I am linked to an unknown reader. A graduate student with an absurd job. I type. I jabber and I think about dinoflagellates. About sunflower crosses and about the fiberglass that has be added to my lips via clove cigarettes and I think about things that I shouldn't be thinking. I know I shouldn't be thinking. or writing let's say/  So I don't. Thoughts don't solidify. They lodge in the back. behind my tongue maybe. Somewhere at the point of hiding but   dinoflaghelates, protistas and what was that sea weed. I think about the LOCNAME LOCNAME valley and I think about the mushrooms in cow shit. I think about the ticos and I think about the chiggers that are living in my legs. I itch. I coat myself with clear nail polish in hopes to suffocate the bugs that are living in my legs and I remember PROPNAME. I remember LOCNAME  and I think about my thoughts and what I am not supposed to be doing in this assignment. Thoughts. I wonder if I think in sentences I wonder what affect my slowish typing has on my stream of consciousness and I wonder if there is a way that typing speed can be measured in this study  so that so link some generalization of dorky 000 psyc students. green and the table in my kitchen makes me want to vomit. orange. What an absurd color. wish I wasn't in the united state. My greencard runs out in a few years wonder what I do. I hope Dr. PROPNAME gets back in his lab because I really need to find out if he has funds to pay me. May have to go back to the library. Brainless job of nothingness that would make me wallow in the world of boredom which isn't entirely bad. Need to focus on school organics and such. Period. Two spaces after the period. Mistakes and I want to eat not hungry and I wonder how many people talk about food in there little computer ramblings  Feel open and Happy that I am not having to edit this. Type type I don't know what I am think PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME house. I remember when I went down to that . she had spiders on hurt wall pain all over the place and we painted clouds on the ceiling and the blue walls were so obnoxious. PROPNAME. Sex sex sex. yeah. This is a strange assignment and PROPNAME's complaint is ringing in my head. Eager to finish so that I can start for Whom the ORGNAME ORGNAME and get on with it. Bio and Carbon atoms bonds and orbitals. Thinking  about the electron configuration that surrounds the last letter in my first name and I think that I must have been granted a full "s" orbital  one up and one down. spinning on opposite directions and I am thinking about Scottish poetry about PROPNAME in his kilt and about my guitar that I am slowly slowly slowly learning to play. I wonder what goes on in this study. I wonder if those happy little bored entertained grad students will scan words and I wonder how I can mess up this study? Random words like . don't know. ;Me me me me me and I wish that some things were easier and I wish that I had been keeping my eye on the clock. Wondering how long I have been typing and wishing that I was finished because I need to find out if I have to / will work in the Botany lab again and all that . ILS Belly and the Flamenco. PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME kickin' it in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I hate PROPNAME's cat and wish that it could be exchanged for a worthwhile ferret. Type type type. I have managed to waste over 00 minutes of time I think. Who knows. What If I was to write this out and it took 00 minutes to write and 00 minutes to type. Thinking about nothing and wishing that some financial aid would come my way. Need a job and a sprinkling of time. Time to go and sign outta here. trees 
__label__label0 here I am writing a required stream of consciousness essay. but the weird thing is that it just has to be done. it doesn't matter what I write about. right now I’m listening to some music that my parents would consider useless noise. it upsets me that they think that the music from their generation is so perfect and magical and music from my generation is crap. and they think that all of the musicians I listen to are miserable drug addicted singers. their music had its fair share of messed up people. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, the grateful dead. despite the fact that these people and other were pretty messed up, they are regarded as some of the gods of rock and roll. I just wish that they wouldn't assume that every band around now is like PROPNAME PROPNAME and nirvana. in fact, if my parents would give it a chance they might actually enjoy some of my music like PROPNAME PROPNAME band, blues traveler, and phish. but I don't want to get off on a rant here. my little window is right next to my computer and I have such a spectacular view. I get to look at the loading dock of the jester cafeteria and on occasion I get to wake up to delivery trucks dropping off some barely edible food at 0:00 am. one would think that with all of the thousands of students at LOCNAME and the hundreds living at jester center, they might have some food that tastes as good as week old liver and onions. I figured that I would be in excellent shape after a semester of living at jester because I walk everywhere, but the food at jester is so loading with fat that it doesn't matter how much you eat. if the university can afford to make millions of dollars of renovations and additions to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, then maybe the could get rid of the somewhat rancid smell in the halls and make the rooms a little warmer that 00 degrees. then they go and build a huge parking garage over a big parking lot. it seems like a good idea until you realize a couple things. about the first two levels are reserved for faculty. if you are lucky enough to get a space in the garage then you have to pay 000 dollars a semester. most of the people that are willing to spend that type of money for parking don't live in jester. they live at Dobie or university towers. of course, I don't have any personal feelings about that issue but I thought someone else should know about it. all in all though , university of LOCNAME is a great place because of a lot of things. beautiful campus, interesting people, a great sports program and , most importantly, absolutely gorgeous women. why would anyone want to go anywhere else especially in LOCNAME. a friend of mine got into duke but that was the only place that she would want to go if she didn't go to UT. Baylor: small campus, nothing to do, and you hang out with the same people from high school. LOCNAME Tech: What is in LOCNAME? and their sports program is a joke because the athletes aren’t real students. Byron hanspard, their star running back had a 0. 00 gpa in his last semester. ORGNAME ORGNAME: do I even have to explain? well my 00 minutes is up and I have to go to class. Hook 'Em Horns!  
__label__label0 I have never used PROPNAME's computer before. It's kind of weird. I don't  like the font being used on this computer. I wish there was a way I could  change it. I am also very irritated that I am still on the same line that  I started on. Maybe if I press enter it will start a new line. There you go. Much better. I am kind of tempted to use this fan connected  on the  desk here, even though I am not hot. I just feel like using it. PROPNAME is funny. We keep writing each other email even though we could be sitting right next to each other. PROPNAME is coming to visit tomorrow. I am so excited. PROPNAME said that he might come the next weekend. I am in love with PROPNAME. He has no idea though. I wish I could tell him, but I know that he does not feel  the same way. He is always talking about how picky he is. I am certainly  not his type. God I wish I was. I told him that one day I would be perfect for him. Sigh. I can't wait to see him. I keep thinking of my exboyfriend. He has to be the biggest jerk known to man. The problem is that I don't think of the bad stuff, only the good. Ok, this is driving me crazy. I don't know how this page has been arranged, but I don't like it . ARGH!  Someone just  died in Carries dorm last night. It sounds horrible. I would be so scared if someone down the hall from me was killed. I've got ten minutes to go. I  can dig it. I don't really like Amber. She gross. Smokes too much. I don't smoke that often. PROPNAME just found one of PROPNAME's hidden cigs. It was funny. He was all saying, I've never seen that before. He's cute. Today's his  birthday. I haven't gotten him a present yet, although I know what I'm gonna get  him. I'm sleepy. I almost feel asleep in biology. Someone did PROPNAME PROPNAME put the spotlight on them. I wonder what someone reading this would be thinking right now. Who the hell is PROPNAME probably. That would be an interesting  job. Reading all the submissions. People's minds are fascinating. I wish I c could read people's minds. Thoughts are cool. You know most of the time  people are really thinking about sex or something else taboo. Actually, I don’t really know if that's true, but I've read statistics. I don't think  about sex all the time, but I do often remember kisses, or picture myself  kissing someone. I hope that's normal. Kissing is so romantic. It can  mean so much. How depressing it is to not have someone to kiss. I often  feel sorry for myself. I don't think that's wrong. My sister just walked in. I was kind of worried that she would see what I was writing. Is that wrong, to be writing about kissing. It is kind of personal. I'm thinking about  dogs now. They are so cute. I really love baby animals. I can't wait to  live in an apartment or house where I can own a mutt. I'd like to own a dog with PROPNAME someday. I think it would scare him if he knew how much I thought  about him. I don't know if I really am in love with him, but I often think I  am. If only I could be forty pounds lighter. I had planned on losing five pounds a month. I haven't checked since moving to LOCNAME. I don't think I’ve lost any weight though. I tend to eat a lot of cafeteria food. We are  going out to dinner to night. I need to ask PROPNAMEulie if she has a scale so that  I can weigh myself. I wasn't to sure I wanted to go. It's with PROPNAME and J and  friends I don't know. I hope I get along well with everyone. I wonder if my train of thought that I'm typing is a good representation of how I really think. Wow, I've written for 00 minutes now. Those last ten minutes flew by. My hand hurts now so I guess I'll stop. I feel as though I should thank you  for listening. Thanks         
__label__label1 I am sitting in the computer lab at ORGNAME wondering if what I'm writing will stay confidential, and I hope it doesn’t become some neato example for all the psych-kids to wanna do tests on me or something. Besides the fact that its kinda cold in here, the only other thing I can think about is how distraught I am that my girlfriend/potential wife wants to end a three year relationship. I know that I have done nothing wrong to cause the break up, and she assured me of that, and that is what confuses me. I would rather it be something about me that she didn't like rather than it be nothing at all, because I could at least come to terms with that and learn from it. She is such a wonderful woman and I love her very much. She said she doesn't NOT love me, but that these three years she has seen no internal peace, and with her graduating this fall, and with all the stress of her future, she can't bear this unrest any longer so she must stop the relationship. She told this to me just two days ago, after not seeing one another for the entire summer since she was working and out of the country while I was here doing summer school (or should I say that summer school was doing me). She just decided to leave me on her own accord and expect me to throw away three years in a single phone call. I am going crazy inside. I cannot understand why she gave up on me over the summer. She is a kind hearted woman and I know that when she told me she loved me that her words were true, and that is why I cannot understand why she's willing to let it all go. Right now I can fell my heart beat very hard. I can sense every time it moves my chest and I can see my shirt moving slightly around the area of my heart. I can see my shirt moving to the beat. My fingers are cold and my mind in total and utter confusion. I sat through two classes phasing in and out of lecture, trying to pay attention, but I can't. I told her that I am coming this weekend to college station to see her and talk to her face to face. I need to know what I can do to remedy this situation. I ask God for guidance, and I can't make out his message. I need to open my heart a lot more and let him inside and clear my mind of this so I can hear him correctly. I can feel the tears beginning to form in my eyes and I push them back very quickly so as to not let on how I am feeling to anyone in this computer lab. She tells me that there's nothing I can say to change her mind, but I need to try nonetheless. I really could use someone to pick me up right now. Now I’m thinking about my 00 hours semester course load and how its going to be so difficult to think straight with this on my mind. I've got to ask my friend/roommate to help me thorough this. 00 minutes. My times' up. 
__label__label1 I'm feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to "cool off". I really like it here at LOCNAME. everybody is very nice. I’m trying to think of what to type. I’ve got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. I’m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask PROPNAME to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she "just friended" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emily’s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. I’m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. I’ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think I’ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PC’s. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since I’ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. I’ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. I’m ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of PROPNAME. I’ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, LOCNAME. I’d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think I’m going to do well here. no problem. I’m very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. 
__label__label1 It's 0:00 and I am beginning this assignment. It's an interesting one. You never really pay attention to how your mind jumps from one thing to another, at least I don't. My roommate just came in. She thinks I am mad at her and I am a little. I'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. I hadn't eaten anything all day and I was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . Thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. I had waited for nothing. We get along very well, but I don't think she realizes what she does. She keeps interrupting me while I'm writing this and it's timed. She got mad at me just now because I asked her to be quiet. She left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. I really don't like the girls next door. We get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. The one's next door just aren't very friendly. My roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because I was playing PROPNAME PROPNAME. One of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. I hope my roommate doesn't start acting like I'm mad at her or vice-versa. She's on the phone. Her guy problems are pretty entertaining. I try to help her out, but I really can't empathize with her. She has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. PROPNAME is going back to PROPNAME tonight. He's one of my friends from home. I've known him since kindergarten. I've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. Maybe he'll decide he likes me too. I doubt it though. That's a depressing thought. Oh well. There are plenty of other guys around here. In PROPNAME there were not even close to as many. Population:0,000. Graduating class: 000. That's why I came here. I wanted to be in a place with many other people. I have definitely found that place. A lot of people from PROPNAME thought I was crazy for wanting to come here. I guess different people want different things. it makes sense. One of our friends from down the hall just came in. She's very cool. She's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. It's very beneficial to know people. Everyone has something to offer. Of course, you have to give also. Some are better at that than others. I know I’ve given plenty of cigarettes. Hopefully I've contributed more than just that. I've offered advice, which of course I always thought was good advice. I've tried to be friendly. I've given complements. I've loaned money and shared food. PROPNAME PROPNAME , I've done my part so far. I think school is going to go well. I just can't let people take advantage of me like I have in the past. I think I can manage the academic  part pretty well. The only thing that is difficult so far is Calculus and that was to be expected. I've been doing my best though, and that's all I can do. 
__label__label1 Labor day weekend was awesome! I love my boyfriend so much. We were so lazy and it didn't even matter what I did with him, because just being with him was enough. We just watched movies and ate. He sent me flowers on Bid day for the sorority Pi Beta Phi. I love that he knows everything about me. He knows when I am sad, happy, etc. I really miss him right know. I hope that he can come on Sunday so that he can se my dorm room and meet my pledge sisters. I can't wait to see what he does for my birthday. I can't believe that I am going to be nineteen years old. It doesn't feel like I should be that old. It just seems like yesterday that I turned sixteen and got my driver's license. My sister is twenty-two years old and engaged. I'm so excited about being her maid of honor in the wedding. I know that I am going to be so emotional that day. Troy is so perfect for her. I know that they will have a long and happy marriage together. He is just like a brother to me. My parents are glad that they will only be an hour away from them. It seems weird that we don't live in LOCNAME anymore. I consider LOCNAME as my home, and not LOCNAME. My parents evidently seem to like it there, even though it is so humid. I thought that LOCNAME was humid. It is nothing compared to LOCNAME. I love PROPNAME so much!  It will be neat when his dad is in session. Maybe he will take me out to eat so I don't have to eat the dorm food all of the time. It really isn't that bad! I just hope that I don't gain the "Freshman 00. "  Dancing will keep me in shape, though. I love my class. Ballet three times a week is just enough times to keep me from not missing my dance studio in Waco. It is really neat to get a lot of different styles of dance from different teachers. I think that it helps and has helped me to be a more well-rounded dancer, and open to new things. I miss my friends from high school. I just talked to PROPNAME today. I was so excited that she called. I know that I am going to have to start writing letters and e-mailing my friends and PROPNAME, after my one hundred dollar phone bill in ten days. I feel really bad about that, but I just didn't understand the whole "phone bill thing. "  As they say, everyone learns from their mistakes. I definitely had to learn the hard way, though. I hope that I have a cheaper bill next month, for my parents' sake. 
__label__label1 It is quiet in my room, PROPNAME is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at PROPNAME's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 0 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 0 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of LOCNAME but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . . 
__label__label1 I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that PROPNAME is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in LOCNAME, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. 
__label__label1 As I am sitting in the computer room at the Castillion, I am thinking of how dull and boring this room is. The walls are a dull gray color and I am all by myself. The chairs are scattered unorderly throughout the room. I am now trying to decide about what I should do for this weekend. I told my parents I was leaving here Thursday night but I now realized I have a sorority function that night and also on Friday. I then thought about leaving Friday afternoon, but that would mean missing the ORGNAME game on Saturday. I also have a sorority field day on Sunday which is not mandatory, so I think I am just going to go home Friday night and miss the game Saturday and also the field day Sunday. My classes this year are overwhelming. I am so swamped with work that I'm worried it will not all get done. When I leave this weekend, I hope to get some studying done considering the Castillion is one big party 00 hours a day and it is very difficult to sleep here. I wish people would take others views in mind and be a little more considerate instead of knocking on your door drunk beyond belief at 0:00am on a Tuesday night. I am going to eat at Subway as soon as I'm finished with this paper because I'm starving and I can't concentrate very well. I have about 0 pages to read in philosophy tonight and about 00 pages in biology. This is such a big difference than in high school when you didn't even have to pick up a book to make an "A" in an honors class. I know that some of my friends are going to have a tough time here at LOCNAME because their parents were so protective over them and now that they are on their own with 0th street so close, they are going to go crazy. Some already have. My roommate here is great. I grew up with her and we get along very well. I am lucky considering there have been several problems with rooming situations in our dorm. The mail situation at this dorm is terrible. My father sent me an overnight package and it didn't arrive until one week later. The food at this dorm is good though. Well my time is now up and I am going to go eat, finally.              
__label__label0 It is now 00:00 and so I cannot wait until 00:00 because at that time my writing will be done. I type slowly anyway so I shouldn’t have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. I am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact I am hungry and stressed out. The first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. I am in college and at this point I need to get my priorities straight. I am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. My mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. I need a job, but I’m so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. I am not the proudest to be in a sorority. Don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but I don't like the whole association that comes with it. My whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. In fact, I like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  I love Austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between ORGNAME and here. There are so many interesting people and I want to get to know them all or at least try. Wow, it's already been over 00 minutes and this has not been too hard. I used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven’t had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why I have been able to do this, and express myself so well. I enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why I write so much-journal, letters, poems. It helps me gain a sense of relief and since I don' express my feelings out loud too often, I need to do this daily, if not more so I can release all that I feel. I am excited about doing psychology this year because I hope to decide between the two majors I am struggling with. I am at the moment down for premed/nutrition and I really do want to go into medicine, but I've also always been interested in criminal psychology. It may be a little depressing, but I find it very interesting, and definitely want a job I love. A few months back, I read Helter Skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so I am hoping this class will help with my decision making. I guess we'll see. It is 00:00 now and time for me to stop. 
__label__label0 Hello!  I really wish I would have learned to type when I was a kid. I have been using computers since I was like seven, but I was never taught like the proper way to type with like which finger goes on which key so I have always ,made up my own little combination and it is kind of weird. I also have to look at my fingers the whole time. I am really tired. I need to catch up on my sleep but I am staying at a friend's house tonight, so something tells me I won't be getting much sleep tonight. But I get I'll get over it. I totally forgot what I was saying. I guess I am brain dead right now. I am actually feeling a little homesick. Not for high school or any thing, but for the way things used to be back home. I had like 0 close friends that were always there and I could be totally natural in front of them, but here it seems like I have to pt on an act, which is the exact opposite of how I figured it would be. My computer is so stupid!  That is why I have to use my friends computer because I can't do anything but play asteroids on my computer because It is so complicated. I am not thinking of any thing to write about right now. I am totally stuck here with out a thought!  That is really not cool because I still have 00 minutes to go !   I have 0 dogs at home. They are very cute except for one, but I feel bad for her because when she was a kid she was beaten up and when we found her collar was embedded into her neck and her back leg was broken. She's better now, but she freaks out ROUND STRANGERS. she HAS NEVER BITTEN ANYONE, BUT MAYBE SHE WILL. my Dad is so great. He always takes in animals that people drop off in front of our house and he has always been so original. Like a month ago he decided to take up golf and he has never played a day in his life so he goes out and hits golf balls on the runways of our airport and he bought this old nasty golf cart and drives around in it. He is just so cool. There are a few strange guys that keep on walking in the room asking for food. My friends have very odd hall mates. that sounded really stupid,. I don't even know the proper name for some  one who shares a hallway with some one else. I got a really bad hangnail today and I bit it off even though your not supposed to and it hurts like crazy. I wonder if any one ever cusses a lot on this. It's not like my grade would drop if I wrote FUCK in really big letters would it?  I guess not since I just did it. maybe I’ll  do it a gain DAMN I don't know why but that's fun! Maybe it's the lack of sleep talking. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I hope someone does, but that would be the most boring job in the world I would figure. All you do is read like 0 pages of someone's ramblings, though I am sure some of them are cool. Sorry mine won't be , but I can't think of anything!  Actually, I used to watch PROPNAME at ORGNAME all the time when I was a kid. I had this old black and white TV in my room and I would watch PROPNAME PROPNAME , PROPNAME PROPNAME and Get Smart. That one had to be my favorite, because PROPNAME was so cool! They had the coolest little devices and ways to get ORGNAME . I really wish They still showed it on TV. The Nick at nite channel really sucks. all they show is Petticoat Junction and THAT girl. Not very interesting, if you ask me!  I am really not thinking of any thing to say right now. IOK I am trying to think of something. I feel bad because PROPNAME is trying to sleep and here I am clicking a way on his computer how rude!  I really hated that show Full House, but I always watched it. I'm so glad they took it off the air. It is so odd, sometimes I can instantly do those magic eye things but other times I can't do them at all. Well, my 00 minutes are up. Bye!

__label__label1 I'm in my boyfriends apartment and my friends and I are doing our laundry. I feel very tired since I have an 0:00am class. I've had a pretty good day though, I love ORGNAME. My classes seem okay and I'm sure I'll do fine. I don't feel at all homesick, which is good. My parents miss me so much though and I feel bad for that. I'm going home this weekend even though I don't want to, but that's okay. I don't think I'm doing this right. no one will probably ever read this so why should I care. I feel like such a number at this school, but I am determined to change that. I feel like I'm writing in my journal. Emily and PROPNAME are over here too and they brought their homework. I wish I had brought mine. I am so afraid that I'm going to get behind in my classes and not make good grades. I want a gpa of 0. 0 or better. Maybe it was stupid to set a goal that high, but that's good for me because last year I could have done a lot better. I don't regret it though, I had a very nice senior year. This year I want to study very hard though and be able to say I tried my hardest. I also want to get a PhD in psychology. I don't know why though because I just want to be a housewife. I love the idea of people calling me Dr. PROPNAME though, that would be so cool. Being a medical doctor is waht my heart desires, but I can't stand the sight of blood. that causes a problem. So, I figured I'd help people another way. If I do work I want to be a child psychologist. I have a passion for kids and want to help as many as I can. That's why I want to be a housewife, so I can be with my kids all day. I'm getting tired of typing now, it should have been 00 min, not 00. I wonder what other people are going to type about. My back is hurting from sitting like this so I'm going to stop. it's been 00 min anyway. I feel weird writing something for school and not using any kind of format, but I really enjoyed it because I hate English with a passion. I took two years of AP English and I didn't pass the AP test my junior year. didn't bother taking it my senior year. Alright goodbye :)  
__label__label0 being new in LOCNAME and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that I've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. All my friends knew me and I knew them. They didn't care about my little flaws. My family was there to support me and care about me. now, I'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. At first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. They have this different feelings and thoughts about me. I may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but I am a forgiving person. I do not hold grudges like others. Which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way I talk, the way I dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. I'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. I try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. Maybe I'm scared of what people think about me. maybe I'm nervous and afraid because I'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. People who know about their mood swings and personality. but, I don't. At first I didn't think much about all this stuff. I was having a good time in rush and with all the new people I have met. But, things have changes and I kind of wish I had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, I guess the reason I'm hear is because I wanted to get away. or at least I thought I wanted to get away. one thing I don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people I don' know. they usually end up telling me that I should think better about myself or that what I'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. I tell myself every night that tomorrow I'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, I can't change how I've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but I had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. My mom calls about three times a day. We're pretty close. but, when I was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and I thought I just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. I call her too. I tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. I thought I would be that kind of person, but I was wrong. I can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. I don't' remember the last time I had to work at being someone's friend. I wish I didn't have to write this for so long. I just feel like I'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. I can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. I'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. A couple of years ago I used to cry everyday. About nothing about something it didn't matter. I was going to go see a psychiatrist. I've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if I went. I think for a little while I'd tell me parents that I HAD to go to one. I convinced them. I dot' know what that was all about. just a phase I guess. I'd still like to go to one. I can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. That would be totally crazy. When people tell me their problems I just think about mine and feel bad for myself. I guess I'm self centered or something. I hear people talking in my hall and wish that I could go out there too, but I promised myself that I'd get some work done before I went off to class. I really haven't eaten a lot since I've been here. I skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. Its crazy. My appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. Oh well. When I get home I'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. My boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. I'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, I learned o accept it because I loved him. or at least I thought it was love. I don't' know yet, and I'll probably never know until I find someone who I feel the same way or more about. That hasn't happened yet. okay, times up. 
__label__label1 this song is really sweet my computer is slow but it's cool it's doing pretty well for me I should start typing next to each other just in case I run out of room. well that's better. hehe. I don't believe PROPNAME did that. actually I'm not sure if I can write that type of stuff on here. it's kind of personal and what if someone reads this. I don't mind if PROPNAME or PROPNAME reads it. but what if it's someone else. never mind about that. start thinking and type what your thinking wenshi. great now I'm talking to myself. that's funny. well. the songs over. what's next. prem is a really sweet guy and I am very lucky to have him. I'm also very lucky to have friends like PROPNAME, phong, thang,julie, janet, sean, and so many more. and especially lucky to have such a mom and dad and three brothers that really care. they take care of me. they do lots for me. wenjen upgraded this computer that I'm using to type. isn't he so nice. what a brother. it's really cold in our room. I feel like I'm talking to someone. and tell them everything about myself. but I don't think that is what stream of consciousness is. I don't know. well I'll just keep typing until time is up. oh yeah. I need to call PROPNAME and ask her if she has an extra cable for our TV in the room. good thing I wrote sentences right next to each other. this assignment would of been really long if I didn't. I know I don't have to worry about spelling and grammar and all but it kind of bothers me. it's not much the grammar and punctuation but spelling and spacing of words. I guess I'm just anal or something. who knows. I think other people like my friends and family know me better than I know myself. geez that shouldn't like that but I think that's how it is. oh well. hmm. what else should I think about. that's weird I'm thinking about what I'm thinking. hehe confusing. I miss my friends from high school that aren't going to UT. I miss my family too. my hometown isn't that far away compared to others but I still miss my friends and family. wow I don't know how others from out of state or even the country do it. it must be hard for them. I'm worried about mommy she's home all by herself. everyone is at a different place. wow. but in October all of us should be together. I can't wait until that day comes. it's going to be so cool. it hasn't been like that for more than a year. my goodness only 00 minutes have passed. I have written a lot in 00 minutes. geez. and 0 more at least. wow. I wish all papers in all my classes would be this easy. I mean it's not easy but easier than other writing assignments. you don't have to worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and just about everything else. just need something on paper. what kind of paper is that. I think I'm in paper heaven. hehe. that's like the coolest thing. I wish other teachers would be so generous. what happened to my music. I didn't pick this to be in my file or play list editor to play music continuously. but it's still a good song. I didn't even know it was in the file. that's pretty cool. actually kind of weird. hmm. I wonder how long it's been now. my hands are kind of getting tired and hard and tense from typing all this continuously. it's actually tough to type so much because you are thinking of so much at a time. it would be easier if I could type faster or my thinking would be less. hehe. that's never going to happen. I have been told I think a lot. and my mommy says I have lots of wrinkles under my feet. she says that means you keep everything to yourself. it's true for me. I don't know about others though. I think that's a cool but weird saying or superstition whatever you want to call it. it is funny too. well. what time is it now. let me look real quick. I started when the time said 0:00 and now when I looked it's 0:00. just one minute away from the minimum time. I'll type a little longer so it's not like I stopped right at 00. well the music stopped. you know what I just realized. I did pick all those songs I thought I didn't pick. that's funny. oh well. well. the playlist is out of songs I have to start it again when I'm done typing which should be ok to be now but let me check just in case the minute isn't over. I don't want to cheat and make it 00. 0 minutes. let me see here. it's 0:00. so I've been typing for 00 straight minutes. wow. my right arm is sore. it really hurts. I guess I should stop now. well nice typing for my first writing assignment in psychology. I'll be writing another one soon for the second writing assignment. well see this page later. hehe. 
__label__label1 He'll never live that down  I'm glad I finally got to this website so I can get these essays over with, I still have to write the other one before Friday--I can't wait till homecoming, PROPNAME is such a sweet girl--I wonder what color her dress will be?  Who else will I know there?  Is it wrong that I'm going back home after just being there this weekend?  I had so much fun with PROPNAME but I'm very upset with PROPNAME. I just have to forget about him and continue reminding myself that he's a jerk and PROPNAME doesn't like him  how could she ever like such a loser   he can't get along with anybody and he brags all the time. If I ever get like that I hope someone tells me and I hope I listen to them. Wow, this is really neat- it's like getting all my feelings out and it's really relieving some stress. Can I swear, I'd better not, I don't want to get in trouble--this is college you don't get in trouble--Tomorrow is my birthday! actually my birthday is in less than an hour--00 years old means I can buy cigarettes, dirty magazines, get into clubs, get into bars--of course, I would never do any of that stuff--only perverts get dirty magazines and I hate smoking--It would be cool to go to a club sometimes but most of the girls you meet there are pretty easy---I like PROPNAME so much--I was going to be really upset if she didn't ask me to homecoming--Even though I'm at college and surrounded by a bunch of really cute girls, I would rather be talking to PROPNAME than any of them. This was the first time we actually spent multiple days in a row with each other. her mom is so old-fashioned--"you saw PROPNAME yesterday so you don't have to see him again for a long time"  Well we went to a football game Saturday, Chili's on Sunday, and bowling on Monday  I bowled so well 000--that's like the highest I've gotten in 0 years--she's just good luck I guess  I'm so lucky to have supportive, caring parents   they have taught me that school comes first so it is not really that hard for me to be away from home and I don't have too much trouble getting myself to do homework. that stupid lab stuff is due tomorrow. no maybe it's due Friday   I wish I didn't have to take ch 000  it looks like it's going to be the class to give me the most homework   I heard it was a weed-out course for Chem E  I don't really feel that much stress right now--I should be really scared about not making it as a chemical engineer because my dad, uncle, and sister are all chem e's but I know I can do it and I know the only way I won't make it is if I don't  study   I can't wait to be 00  I can finally get a credit card-- if I get a credit card will I spend more money?  I doubt it I have check cards and they're the same thing  I've got to stop eating out so often   dad is paying for all my meals at doby and if I'm too lazy to walk over there it's my own fault ---lazy--am I gaining weight?  the freshman 00--would PROPNAME still like me if I were fat?  I don't think I'll get fat--I can always diet  I lost 00 pounds just 0 years ago    boy I hope my parents buy a smaller house so they can get me a car  I wonder if they'd ever get me a camaro  probably not "no 0 door cars you can't get groceries in them"  how often will I be putting groceries in my car anyway?  boy I type pretty fast  I could be a court whatever it's called who types what everyone says--that would be such a scary job  if you ever got behind how would you ever catch back up again?  has it been 00 minute yet  I think so  
__label__label1 I wonder if the twenty minutes is what they're grading for because I type so slow they'll probably think I only wrote e for five minutes  I didn't realize the assignments were due today I thought they were due tomorrow, oh well I wonder if that means if I have to0 finish that damn pretest. I guess so          that girl has some funky hair, I can't even type without having to look up    its just like bam!!! in front of me,  I need a computer at home so I don't have to come to the library all the time. I don't get much done at home though so many distractions   what can I make for dinner there s nothing to eat at home, maybe kimchi cheegae  but I made that two times already maybe robert got some groceries,   we need some onion and garlic otherwise I can't really make much   oh shit I need a rice cooker still before I can go and make all this  maybe I'll invite PROPNAME over to eat. yeah I wonder when her classes are even over. yeah I can just tell her to bring her rice cooker over and I'll cook,     she will probably want to eat Korean food anyway because I'm pretty sure that the Dobie food can't be that good. if it is at all like the jester food, that stuff gives me the runs. I don't know  maybe they put supplements in it to reach nutritional guidelines  but whatever it is it is not any good for me. the jester people must get used to it part of their body's way off adapting to a new nutritional source. nutrigrain bars are awesome. I'm so damn hungry. they should have a cafe here in the ORGNAME so those late night studies can have some refreshment lemonade  that's what I want it's funny how me and Angela have so much in common I bet she is thinking lemonade right now. I wonder what PROPNAME thinks of her?   that would be fucked up if they were both lying to me. I guess I just have to trust him. I've known him for so long but sometimes you'd do fucked up things for a girl, I couldn't blame him either because I've done such before also. I regret it of course. this guy told me not to ever regret something you've done because if you keep doing that then it is like you're asking back everything you done in you're life. so you may as well not ever be living it. I didn't even really know him we were just fishing next to each other and ha was old, I wish I could go fishing right now. it relaxes me and all this stuff is stressing me and I need to relax. I guess I could go fishing in freshwater but that can't beat the sun nothing can beat fishing the surf of san PROPNAME pass all night even if you don't catch anything just being there when this sky turns purple then blue then a whole myriad of colors that you can't even describe from yellow to black     and than the sun comes and you make your last couple of casts not even caring really to catch a fish kind of a solute to the sun for thanking whatever you caught or didn't catch for next time.  ok that's been about thirty minutes and I'm going all philosophical I think I'm done 
__label__label0 I tried to get onto your pretest experimental thing and it didn't let me on that's very bad for m e since I will have to waste more damn time tomorrow doing it I heard it takes a long time to do. This whole college thing is really starting to scare me I missed my Si session today for Rtf and let myself down. I f you want to make an impression on these people you have to grab them by the balls with a 0. 0 average. How am I going to do that when I have already missed one of the damn Si's  I'm telling you I better get my act  What am I even doing here I need to get my mind on other things like movies why aren't your thoughts ever on movies they're always on what to do to impress the next person . Just get ahead of thy game early and you'll do fine  God I hope I get a $. 0. $. 0 the way to go. I don't want grad school though LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that's where I'm going to be in a while no matter what. I have it the right stuff. PROPNAME PROPNAME. Good movie. Remember what the guy at ORGNAME said The Right Stuff had god use of parallel editing. where you edit two frames together that are similar in how the shot is set so as not to disrupt the audience's attention. What is the audience's attention . Movies. this paper what am I rambling about I wonder if the proff will read this Jesus you type like a gorilla . PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in the Mist about some ape lady PROPNAME something. Ironic that was in our psychology book. ironic but not funny just ironic sue me I took a pause to see how much time I had left this is all anyway what is it supposed to prove that our mind wanders is it supposed to give us some great insight into how we think  rrAAh. it is pretty fun and it will be interesting to read over this am I supposed to wow I'm a slow typist that sucks. What was it sophomore year that I got a B in keyboarding yeah I told PROPNAME PROPNAME about PROPNAME PROPNAME and we always used to fight each other in class and he'd pretend that I was beating him up why are you and all of these people so concerned about each other especially women is it just to procreate that we are interested in women or is it like Psychology. professor says that there can be different views on the whole thing. Of course dumb question there can be different views on every thing but which is the right one?  time up 
__label__label0 Why must it be so hard?   Why must I live like this?  Would it not be better if I simply throw away my life?  It would be so much easier. I wouldn't have to worry all the time about people's criticism. I wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes. But then, I'm human am I not?  Aren't we social creatures?  If I seperate myself from others, would I not cause myself harm?  Would I not also cause others pain?  A life lost is a gift lost. It is so difficult for me to live like this. Always in pain. But sometimes I gain a sense of glory when I live through the sufferings. It's as though these sufferings are meant to makme stronger. Like steel being tempered in a hot flame. Yet, there's still more pain to come. Will I survive?  surely there will be a point when I will not get stronger and break. But then how will I know where my limit is?  whether I live a mediocre life or on to te fullest, I will die. However, it seems as though the latr fashion of life is better. Therefore, with spirit, I will strive to live out that lifestyle. I try each moring, to fight the tempatations and do what is expected of me. If I live this way and think that it is the best way. Should I not persuade others to do the same?  Why not?  It seems that if everyone lived their life more fully, mankind will be more efficient and fruitful. We will  prosperous as  whole. But if I were to tell this opinion to others, someone will tell me that I should respect their opinion that they can do what ever they wish. But if it is right to repect all the opinions of all people. Would there not still be a conflict which contradicts that opinion that says that we all must respect the opinion of all?  For example, what if someone else's opinion is that people should not accept all opinions as truth. Would not the opinion of the person saying that we should respect all opinion be contrary to that opinion?  This brings about a lot of contradictions. Hence, notall opinions are to be respected.           
__label__label0 What time is it. I need to be at the house at ten. My mouth feels like the sensation you get right before you throw up. They say that Gatorade is a thirst quencher but why does it make your mouth so dry. It is so quiet right now. As I stare at my roommates applied calculus book I am lost in the colors. The bright colors formed in various shapes and sizes make a maze for my wandering eyes. I wonder what I have to write for the other assignment. God, I could really use a shower. It seems like I have been sweating all day. I wonder where my roommates are and what they are doing?   My roommates are slobs. I feel as if I am in a sea of clothes as I sit here on my roommates computer. I wonder if that picture of PROPNAME was ever really a picture that was taken by somebody or was it all just from computers. If it was a picture that was taken I wonder what that bull was thinking. he was probably thinking how ridiculous humans are. Actually, he was probably thinking where the best area in the pasture to eat grass is. I don't like this assignment very much. I feel like some druggy. Look at the colors man, and all the shapes. I don't know. It's kind of cool to put down on paper the th0ings you are thinking. 
__label__label0 In this short amount of time I changed from a kid who major worries were only about him self. I feel that I have really grow up. I believe it was all the time that I got screwed over by my so called friends. The first time was a the first of my senior year. Well I meet this guy named PROPNAME and he was from Indian and we shared common interest. However he was new in town and did not have a girl friend. However I was dating this one girl for about year. Well This girl was very possessive, and very wealthy. Not to forget she was beautiful. During the summer I worked as a Life guard and taught swimming lesson in the mornings at her house(made tons of money) Any her family and her left for LOCNAME and had me house sit. No problem making money had a garage full of tool to work on my cars and basically had my own house. I had not friends because they all graduated A year earlier and PROPNAME had been my only friend this past year. Partially because she was so possessive. Well I meet PROPNAME at the end of the summer and became good friends. He was going to start school with us in the fall and everything was great. Until PROPNAME got home and said not more PROPNAME. She did the same thing with an early friend PROPNAME. However I finally told her either she relaxes or we break up Decision help by PROPNAME. So we broke up. So I was dating again. Before PROPNAME I had a new girl friend every two days. PROPNAME and I were dating these two girl PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Well PROPNAME and PROPNAME started dating and the only thing between Casi and I was a Physical thing so once I stop see her. PROPNAME influence PROPNAME in stop hanging out with me. Five months down the road I have and new group of friend they a grade younger than me. They have not had as much luck with the girls as I have so I am letting them meet some of my friends from out of town were a very tight group for about two months when one of the guy in the group named PROPNAME thinks I am having a sexual relationship with a girl he likes. Because she has hickeys on her neck. That same week I had really bad scratch marks on my back not from her. Well he think something is going on and starts a fight with me at school and I break his nose in front of the entire school assembly. Later next week PROPNAME girlfriend and him break up. So the next day PROPNAME is at my house. We hang out not stop for about three weeks. Fishing hunting cruising for girl everything, well Lorine wants to get back with PROPNAME so she brings out this story from way back in the past. (lorine and I were dating a long time ago)  She said that I was inviting her over to my house. Well I was, to a party so she can see PROPNAME. But she tell I so PROPNAME gets mad at me and tries to fight me. At my own house during this party. PROPNAME is a very Muscular guy and very big!!!!. Well I talk it out after we both have black eyes and we have not been close since. Anyway I now dating this really nice sweet girl who is very intelligent and pretty. I just hope it stays as good as it is now. 
__label__label1 ever since the first day of school on august 00 I have felt so much fear. it has never hit me so hard as right now typing on a computer  not knowing one person around me yet some of them being my classmates. my thoughts of u t are hard to explain. some days are bad some good, it just depends on the day and class. I grew up in a small town went to the same school district my whole life and graduated with 00 people in my class. my psychology class has close to000. its very overwhelming . I have made a few new friends but I still feel very alone. I live with my boyfriend off campus and its hard. I just feel very alone. my parents seem to have forgotten about me, but the already had by the time my senior year had come. my brother goes to tarleton in stephenville near ft worth. my best friend goes to LOCNAME a m in college station. i'm taking 00hrs and my favorite class is swimming. I'm really bored and I want to go shopping after I get done with this writing assignment,. english is my last class today and it ended early at 0000. I'm really bored and only 00 minutes have gone by I'm tired of writing. I hate seeing all the little rich girls with their fancy clothes walking around campus. it pisses me off because I screwed up and moved into a apartment. early this morning I was in the lab signing in to use a mac. the computer told me to go to b0 so I did and when I got to the computer there was stuff on it but the computer screen had my number on it so I know to use it . but the bitch comes up and starts freaking out about it was her computer. people piss me off because my parents taught me respect and politeness and everyone at ut seems to thing that they need to be rude I just don't get it I'm thinking of transferring to LOCNAME a m because I went down there to help move my best friend into her apartment and I had the best time I've ever had. we went to a bar and I drank at the bar and I'm only 00 so we had fun you could never get away with that down here in austin. its almost time for me to stop then I'm going shopping with the little money I have. I can't wait to get off campers because boyfriends name is jimmy and he is going to go to acc in the spring to get a degree in electrical technicians he already is one but he want a degree to  get more money. it almost time to stop its almost time to stop its almost time to stop then go home it's labor day weekend and I'm so glad because were having a party at the lake house and taking the boat out to go skiing,. can't wait. well its time to stop so I'll  
__label__label1 I really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    I am listening to a PROPNAME PROPNAME's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves PROPNAME PROPNAME. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to LOCNAME to go to graduate school. PROPNAME PROPNAME was going to be in LOCNAME on Friday and LOCNAME on Saturday. So PROPNAME ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help PROPNAME move and see the concert in LOCNAME. On our way to LOCNAME the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. PROPNAME was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to LOCNAME and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to PROPNAME. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was PROPNAME, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 00 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  
__label__label0 like how my day was, yeah, I woke up real early today, likie 000 and theres still ab unch of people walking in and out of my room like this one girl who likes my roommate, and I know I left my last topic right in the middle but illcome back, so anyway, this girl that just walked into my room like my oommate, and she seems really nice, and shes cute enough, but someone told my roommate that shes not cute and now he doesn't like her, now I must concede that in the past, I've realized that girls aren't as beautiful as I originally thought, bcause someone else told me they didn't think so and I relized id been projectin something on the girl, or looking a little too hard for something that's not there, so I shouldn't judge or somethinng like that and and so I woke up for an 000 class this morning, and it was a LOCNAME stuy session that was completely pointless, I miss my high school calculus class, I miss my high school cal teacher, she was a very good teacher, I ad lot of those in high school, so I guess I'm pretty lucky, but she was a really good teacher, and a lot of my friends in the class got together ad had a great study group, because, well for many reasons, first of all they werent my best friends, thy were three girls and my brohter, but they werent my best friends, and so I didn't have to worry too much about getting too off topic at the biegginning of the year with stupid inside jokes, we could just study, and later onwhen we became better friends, we could talk for hours about iomportant stuff, or reminice, and still know when to crachk down and actually study, also like I said the teacher was just great, I'm going back this weekend and since its labor day we don't have school on monday so I may just skip school tuesday and stay home to  go back and visit some of my old teachers, and I've only got 0 more minutes of writing, but I really think thatd be nice, uhh I'm out of tuff to say again, and everyone is babbling in the background, and I'm trying to tune him out, or them out, but now I'm losing total train of thought and so I'm going to start babbling again or risk having to stop all together and so I don't have any more classes today and I'm struggling here and my roommates playing playstation, so I went and worked out the other day, actually yesterday, and it was the first time in 0 months, but I'm going running and weight liftin again today, and I havent run in about the same length of time and so I'm sorta worried about taht, but I'm looking forward to it to, getting a little chubby you know, so I'm starting to work out 0 days a week, about one to two hours a day, and I'm worried is going to but a strain on my homework, but I've always been able to to manage time in the past and I just noticed that I've got less than aminute and now I'm done so I'm wrapping up saying goodbye if you ever read this, I ope you enjoyed this little window into my head 
__label__label0 I am very attached to her and am having trouble dealing with her not being with me 00/0. We have dated for almost a year and a half and I don't want to date other people, yet I need someone that is physically with me that I can become close to. I call her all the time and it seemed that nothing has changed in our relationship after being with each other this weekend, yet at the same time as much as I want to see her as much as possible, I have so much trouble saying goodbye to her and letting her go that I sometimes think that it is not worth even seeing her. I knew long distance relationships would be hard, but I didn't realize how tough it would be mentally as opposed to physically grueling. We both don't want to date, yet we will have to get used to the fact of not being able to see each other but 0 or 0 times a month for the next 0 years. I am confused and I was told in the first place not to get myself in this position of having a long distance relationship, but we started dating the summer before senior year and I didn't know it would last this long at the time. On one hand I wish I never met her so everything would be easier, but on the same token she is the person closest to me and besides being my girlfriend, she is my best friend. I know if it was meant to be, then it will work out, but for now I don't know what to do. 
__label__label1 I am twenty-two years old and I still have apprehension towards computers. I don't really know why. I guess it is because of my lack of experience with them. I am also worried about the pre-testing. I tried to access the site but it would not let me connect. My boyfriend just told me that he thinks it is stupid that a class is relying on computers so much. At first I agreed with him, but as I am typing this, I am beginning to think that it is sort of cool. Speaking of my boyfriend, he is currently in his kitchen heating up  leftovers. I can smell them and it makes me sick to my stomach. Oh well, I will get acclimated. I have something on my mind. But first I would like think about my day and my new major. Well, I changed my course of study, but not really. For the past two years I have been in the school of architecture. I love buildings and I love to design. I sacrificed a lot to get into the school and not to mention adding on three extra years to my college life. It was such a major decision. Well, I just entered into a new course of study, it is architectural interior design. The interior design program moved into the school of architecture so they beefed up the program and gave it prestige. Back to my boyfriend. I feel like I had an emotional affair with his best friend. That really sucks. I can't seem to get the other guy out of my mind. I am even having dreams about him. I e-mailed him today. It was a big step 
__label__label1 They are playing the ORGNAME ORGNAME. They're good but I think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. There closing pitcher, something like, LOCNAME is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to PROPNAME PROPNAME of the ORGNAME. I'm really hungry right now. I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in LOCNAME. LOCNAME has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in LOCNAME. I love LOCNAME and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to LOCNAME for my grandmother's 00th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 00 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. 
__label__label1 I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 0 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading "Reader friendly material"  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 00 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in LOCNAME)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 00th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. PROPNAME just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! 
__label__label0 So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking. Ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a "social smoker. "  I have told him how I feel and asked that he at least not smoke when I'm around because I refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. Besides, I don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. I care way too much about him. We've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. He's really important to me and I'd do anything for him. That's why I hate the fraternity so much. I see the bad influences they have on him. He wants to go to medical school, and he MUST have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. He certainly has the potential and I really don't want him to fail. But, I really need to learn to let others lead their lives. I know I can't boss everyone around. I know I'm very controlling and that I've really made some bad feelings between us, but I can't help it. I get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when I think about all that stuff. I hate it when people don't listen to me (usually I end up being right too). Well, that's 00 minutes.  
__label__label1 john is talking a lot. I don't care if a lot is supposed to be 0 separate words. I like this song. wow It's already been 0 minute. I guess I just think slowly. hmmm, my mind just went blank. oh crap, I have 0 classes tomorrow. did I finish all my homework yet?  oh shit, I have a lot of calculus to catch up on. I've only done like 0 assignment out of 0!  PROPNAME is talking to PROPNAME and it's interrupting my stream of consciousness. hey. if you're unconscious, and you have a dream, is that stream of Unconsciousness??  hahaahahaha  that's a cool thought!!   ahhahahha!! oh cool, my friend is online!  she was at the party on Saturday that I dj'ed. I thought I dj'ed crappy ORGNAME everyone says I ORGNAME like a club DJ. I wish I could DJ ORGNAME but ORGNAME is owned by DJ boombai. I wonder if he's any good. he uses records instead of CD's. I hear he spins hip hop. I guess I have a chance since I mix club music and not hip hop. PROPNAME is instant messaging me!  argh, I've written so much and it's only been 0 minutes. do I really have to do this for 00 minutes?  this is pretty brainless. I wish all writing assignments were like this. wow it's late already. I go to sleep too late everyday. I better go to sleep early. all we do is watch TV. marc mcgwire broke the homerun record today. that's pretty cool. I wonder how PROPNAME sosa feels. I bet he's happy for him but deep inside he was like "damn, I almost had it!"  he still has a chance though. wow my bed is messy. the covers are like everywhere. I like my posters. chow yun-fat's gun is cool looking. Acura integra is such a cool car, especially the type R. I wish I had a type R. after college, I want to get a type R. I wonder if I'll be rich after college. I hope I'm rich. I wonder what my future will be like. I wonder if I'll be living in an apartment or a house. I wonder when I'll get married. I want to get married around 00 - 00. I wonder who I'll marry. I wonder if it'll be my girlfriend right now. I really like her a lot. I can't imagine being without her. she was at the party on Saturday too. I wonder if anyone else will get me to DJ their parties. I hope so - I want to make some extra money. what the hell kind of song is this?  mp0's are the coolest things!  I can download them for free and burn them onto a CD and make my own favorite CD's. I might go for a masters degree. I might get more money. I know!  when I get my bachelors, I'll look for a high paying job. then if I don't get a good job, I'll go back for the masters. I can imagine myself as a traveling type of businessman, getting up early in the morning, taking a shower, putting on my armani suit, kissing my wife goodbye, driving my PROPNAME to work, coming back in rush hour traffic, and doing it all over again. ooh how long has it been?  it's been 00 minutes. cool!  I'm almost done with this one. I wonder how long the next assignment is. I still have to do that pretesting thing. PROPNAME and PROPNAME have been gone for a long time. I wonder when they'll be back. I wonder what they're doing. did they work out or hoop?  my girlfriend is a private investigator. hahhahhahaa  lethal weapon 0 was a cool movie. jet li is awesome. he kicks ass. I wonder if I'll have time to take martial arts next year. should I take capoeira or kung fu with my because?  I hate this song. john's taking a shower. something is beeping. my contacts are dry. I want to play starcraft. that's a fun game. I like to build up and overwhelm the opponent. oop, times up. 
__label__label1 So much needs to be done within the next two days, it seems practically impossible to get it done. I have to write these two essays, redo the entire freaking' pretesting crap just because I completed 00% of it and then when it kicked me off, it didn't even save it although I was informed otherwise. So, frankly, I'm disturbed by a lot of things. I have a journalism test tomorrow morning, which, by the way, I haven't studied for, and tonight I had a presentation for ORGNAME, a service organization I would like to join if, in the midst of all this chaos called "college", I can somehow find the time for a decent social life. So this "stream of conscience" theory is going to be more of a "PROPNAME needs to vent" period, because frankly, that is all that is on my mind. I had a crappy day, and I don't expect writing this will help me all that much, but I'll go ahead and say what happened. Some egotistical freak from the male species grabbed my ass today while I was one of the many cross walks on this large campus. Granted I hyper-extended is wrest, at worst I broke it, I would like to request respect from the gender that so frequently asks the inevitable question "why"  when the finger always points to them!!  It was freaking' hot outside all day, and running from class to class always makes it oh so much cooler!!  And the whole idea of college is running through me now when I have deadlines for tests, papers, and self-indulgent pompous professors who think they know the answer to the world, and what's even scarier than that is that WE pay to wake up at 0 AM to go to their lectures and believe the handfuls of bullshit they try to feed us. (I was making a generalization about the professor part of course, some lectures are actually stimulating. )  To top it off, somewhere in the midst of all of this mumbling jumble of chaotic words, I feel almost depressed tonight. I met a guy at the ORGNAME organization meeting mentioned before, and I REALLY like him, and I heard that he was interested, but I haven't seen him in six days, and I honestly think that he could actually calm me from this feeling of intense pressure. If I could just see him I would relax and then take a different view on all the crap that I still have to do. I guess I just need him right now, and the longer I go before I see him again, the more distant and hopeless I feel toward him. I guess you can say I've been lulled into inertia by my subconscience feelings to see him. Anyway, my twenty minutes of rambling has come to an end, so it was great venting and I hope, in some weird way, this has satisfied your requirements and calmed your thoughts and revelations about the stream of conscience in a frustrated, tired, and ticked off college student. 
__label__label0 I ran out of the regular clothes I wear to school and all that was left in my closet were dresses. I'm also a bit upset because the guy I am interested in keeps giving me mixed signals and his emotions just run hot and cold. I feel that he may just be leading me on and it really hurts me because I really like him and I have felt this way for a while now. My friends tell me to just forget about him but easier said than done. And I'm afraid to say anything to him because I may just be making a fool of myself. But, I really hate to think about this because it just depresses me (a subject we just finished talking about today in class). I hope to learn more about it and maybe learn something about how to analyze his behavior with me. Aside from that and probably the biggest thing on my mind right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. I know tonight I will be up pretty late even though I have to be at school at 0am! I have forgotten how stressful school is. I guess lazing around all summer couldn't last forever. Oh well, it doesn't matter I actually like school and some of the pressures. It makes life interesting. Now, I'm wondering if my roommate will be home when I get there. She is a great person and I really like sharing an apartment with her this year. The only problem is that we goof around a lot together and don't get much done we decide to do homework in the same room. Good thing we have a 0 bedroom apt. Speaking of our apartment. I'm really hungry! My stomach was growling so much in class the guy next to me was looking at me funny. I just wish there were more hours in the day so I could get more things done. But, I guess everyone feels that way. As I write this I'm just glad I am at least getting one assignment out of the way. And I wish all of my assignment for all my classes were this easy. haha Well, I guess I am running out of things to say so it's a good things my twenty minutes are almost up. I'm just mad that I can't check my email because there is something wrong with my disk. I swear computers hate me. Now I won't know if my friend PROPNAME wrote me back. I will buy an other disk tomorrow. great another expense. I need a job. 
__label__label1 Here goes. Do you mind if I write a story. I'm a lot better a stories than I am about talking about my real life. The stories are more exciting, anyway. Did you note that I used a space in between a and lot?                             A Day For Something  Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago or something rather to that effect, (not affect), people lived in gray boxes. These boxes were called people boxes, because there were people inside them. But all of a sudden, people starting thinking that there might BE something outside of those tiny, cramped, dirty boxes they were inside of. So they came out and looked around. But they were wrong. There was just a lot more of the same around them.  Yea. Happy, nice, story. I think it means something about "Man's Glorious Ascension Through Time" or something to that effect. Here's another one. I'm pretty good at stories, but not much else. At least you'll have fun reading these, but if you don't, I'm still pretty sure the dumping sites aren't completely filled up yet.                          The Wonderful Talking Box of PROPNAME PROPNAME  Sorry. The title is wrong. But it sounds better than nothing, right? Here we go. This story isn't about much at all. It's about some crazy people who believed some retarded things and ended up being dictators of small, third world nations. -"We are sorry to inform you that the last paragraph was written by somebody who  has just been sacked. However, to continue the mindless assignment, it will be continued and stuff. "   Okay, okay, imagine this. A giant, 000 foot tall monster with 00 right arms, 00 left arms, 00 heads, and 00 legs is running about town and devouring people. This monster's name is PROPNAME PROPNAME.  Alright. Story. There was a time when everybody knew everybody else and everything was cool because everybody knew everybody and nobody knew anything. Got it?  Now some people learned things, others didn't, and others simply got to know everybody better. No. Wait. Oh, man, now I have to start over. I bet you're tired of reading gibberish like this.  "Hey, PROPNAME. "   "What?"   "I just said, 'Hey, PROPNAME. '  You weren't supposed to answer or anything. "   "Oh, okay. "   "Oh, uh, PROPNAME. "    "PROPNAME!"   "What?!"   "You were supposed to answer that time. "   "Was I?"   "Yep. It's in THE RULES. "   "What are 'THE RULES'?"   "It's just, you know, THE RULES. "   "Where did that spooky noise come from?"  rrAw, screw this. I'm out of time, anyway. (Grammatical errors in this piece of work: anyway      anyway ) fin Go home. Stop reading this. If you keep reading this, it won't tell you anything. 
__label__label1 I often wonder why I put so much effort into such trivial things such as looks because that can only do so far. I'm not happy with myself a lot and I run from my problems and it seems co dependence is necessity for me. college has been a wake up call and a sobering realization of how small we are. PROPNAME PROPNAME wrote in a speech something along the lines of "we as humans are not afraid that we can't shine but we are afraid the of the things that we can do. any I feel like the catcher in the rye writing like this . it's so random my girl sent me a tape of songs to remember her by and they are supposed to sooth but instead they keep me up because I have such vivid memories of her. I worry about not being successful and being surpassed by my friends and that they will forget about me. I moved to LOCNAME in the middle of the summer and I was so depressed and I would look at myself and I hated the state of mind I was in and the negativity I was supporting and it was a ridiculous waste of time. I vow to make the place I'm at the best place. I bitch about so many things that are so trivial. there was an airplane crash the other day and everyone died . I can't help but think about how bad it is for those families and friends and here I was missing mine but they are certainly not dead. the people who have been directly affected by it are immersed in some tough times, and for me life is good. it's crazy how things work like that. I tried keeping a journal ,but I can't keep up with it very well so far, I can't wait to play lacrosse ,it has become such a big part of my life. every morning I wake always wishing I could sleep , but at night I always stay up, I wonder if a good philosophy to live life by is to say live everyday like the next day you going to get hit by a bus. it interests  me to talk to my parents and older adults to ask what they would have done differently if they could go back because it makes you realize how fast life goes by. my dad was so smart and I feel so much pressure to live up to him but he would kill me if he knew some of the things I've done, sometimes I feel ashamed but on the other end it is learning from mistakes. well this was interesting , I can't wait till the weekend, till christmas and till Tuesday when lacrosse starts.      
__label__label0 I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like LOCNAME is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend PROPNAME. She is at ORGNAME but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with ORGNAME. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at ORGNAME but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in LOCNAME. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the ORGNAME, and LOCNAME is LOCNAME' little piece of LOCNAME. I am going back home to PROPNAME in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. 
__label__label1 now the computer is making noise. I wonder why it does that. I have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. I guess that is what it is doing but I am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is PROPNAME and I am in psychology 000 with PROPNAME. so far I have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. I am not for sure if it is because I find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and / or interesting in his way of presenting the material. Either way I enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. I am starving too. I wonder what we are having at the LOCNAME LOCNAME house for lunch today. it better be good. I am starving. I have had a bad headache all day too. I hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because I haven't eaten lunch yet. I t will probably go away when i0 eat. it usually does. tonight I have a lot of homework to do. Chemistry is keeping me very busy. I had no idea that Chem000 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. I wonder if I will play catch with PROPNAME again today. it will probably be good for me if I do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. I wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. I wonder of pres. PROPNAME is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with PROPNAME PROPNAME like he did. that was really stupid of him. I can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. I bet PROPNAME is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what I saw. that sucked that I had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. I wonder how long PROPNAME will be at he is supposed to be out for 0 to 0 weeks. I think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. I never knew he went to ORGNAME until this weekend when they said it during the Horns v. ORGNAME game. I wish we would have won that game, but I really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. I hope that is caries over to the LOCNAME St. Game. if we would win that game it would be so large. I wonder if we are still going to be in the top 00 pole after this weekend. I hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. PROPNAME did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. I wonder if all of my friends had fun in LOCNAME. while they were there for the game. I hope I get to go to LOCNAME. for some reason in the near future. I have never gotten to go there before. I think I get to go this summer with PROPNAME and her family if they still go. that would be fun. Mom and Dad head for LOCNAME in about 0 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. I wish I could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, I want to go on a cruise sometime too. I think that would be the most fun. I can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. I have seen pictures but that is all. I hope I can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows. 
__label__label1 that's  a typical girl response I guess I still have about fifteen minutes left I tried right before this to take the pretest again. the first time I only got as far as the 00th question and it wouldn't let me continue now it says the line is busy or something like that I don't mind volunteering for experiments and I understand that experimenting is essential for the psychology students but I think that it is wrong for the department to force us to do this or they will block our grade and I have already been to mezes twice to try to sign up and there was no space left and the only space left was for males only so it's just a little frustrating I'm trying to think I don't type very well because it has been so long since I had to type anything I can't remember when I wrote an essay last my high school was a joke we only had 0 classes at a time for an hour and a half per class every day and we had finals four times a year although I usually exempted them you don't know how glad I am to be out of high school I really didn't like it there too much that might have something to do with the fact that we had 0000 students on one campus I really enjoy attending ut although I don't have a major yet everyone says that's okay but I would really like to get onto taking courses that specifically interest me I'm thinking about majoring in government with a minor in german but I might go into political science it's whatever I've so many ideas of what "I want to be when I grow up" that even includes psychology like everybody and their mom wants to do. I have about five minutes left I'm still hungry and after this I'm going to try to take the pretest again. yesterday I moved from the 00th floor of jester west to the 0th floor my roommate never showed up and this girl PROPNAME's roommate also never showed up so I moved into her room she's really nice and this is so weird: we are so alike she even has my birthday she lives in LOCNAME city which is right outside LOCNAME where I live pretty nifty huh so we're going to go shopping and decorate our room some more it's going to look really cool I'm still hungry and I really don't want to eat that nasty jester food but I might as well because I already paid for it well not really the bill comes later this month anyway my 00 minutes is up and I'll be back here tomorrow to do assignment number two 
__label__label0 I have gone to three computer labs this morning, and have gotten screwed out of all of them. It started over at the ORGNAME, where I signed up for a Mac, but saw a free scanner, When I sat down and logged in at the scanner, I realized my other assignment had come up. I decided to logout of the scanner because you're not supposed to use a scanner computer if you're not going to scan anything. So I went over to my assignment, but it was someone else's computer!  So I decided to sign up again (disgruntled). This time, though, the line was about a mile long (not really, but still REALLY long). About half way through the line, and a few minutes later, I realize that I had been assigned to a different computer, but my time was almost up. So I ran over to the computer and quickly typed in my password, but it wouldn't take it. I desperately attempted to logon before my time was up, but the insolent computer would not give it up!  Now a little less than happy, and a little more than frustrated, I went back to the line. Only this time it was at least twice as long. NO!  I remembered though, my MISS professor talking about a business lab, so I went over to the CBA. Of course it was on the 0th floor, and one of the escalator's was broken, but I made it up there; just to find out I had to sign up and wait a day so they knew I was a business student. How asinine!  So I signed up (trying to dig my pen into the page) and proceeded to the good old PROPNAME laboratory, where there is always room to work. There were plenty of computers when I arrived, so I sat down (a little relieved) and pulled up Netscape. The soul purpose of my computer escapades was to check my email and to do this darned project, so I tried to get into my account. "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". What? "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?" Damn it. Of course, the computer couldn't do email. SO I switched. Same song, second verse. I tried three others, and still the same chorus: "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". So I accepted the fact that somebody doesn't want me on email. I'm now trying to drudge through this assignment without breaking anything. And yes, time flies when you're having fun, but it moves as slow as hell when you're pissed off, wet, and hungry. That's about the only thing I have to look forward to now: eating. Luckily I packed myself a lunch today. Last time I neglected that responsibility and was forced to eat at ORGNAME's. $0, and I felt like cap for the rest of the day. I'm trying to stay healthy. You see, last semester, I worked out really hard, and got pretty buff before the end of school, but throughout the summer, I lost access to the gyms, and I lost a lot of my muscle mass. Now I am struggling to get back in the swing of things, and fast food really sets me back!  You can add that to the list of anxieties, too. Working out for the first week is always hell, but now I'm on Creatine, and I am twice as sore. Of course, now my hands are hurting from typing straight for 00 minutes, but that is bearable. I guess I sound like quite the whiner, but I am really an easy going guy. I always try to have a pleasant disposition; I really do, I walk around making a constant effort to keep a smile on my face ( It also makes it easier to wink at the girls). But today, things just aren't going well. I really wanted to check that email because I'm supposed to be getting a message from this GORGEOUS girl. But oh well, maybe my lack of correspondence will serve as "playing hard to get". Well, 00 minutes is up, and my hands need a rest!  Hope this is what you all wanted! 
__label__label1 so I'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. I have no real plans for tonight so I decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that I'm going through right now and yes I am going through a lot of personal problems but I don't want to write about those because I've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and I sort of get along but I'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares I went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country I mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about I mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and I'm not having much but that's another story. I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 00 minutes and I'm tired 
__label__label1 I just met her parents and sister and they are very nice people I am glad to be  rooming with her I am not sure her religion but she is from san antonio  she is indian kyle is coming over here in a few minutes I hope he comes  soon we might go out to eat at a really good restaurant I want to but I'm n not sure if he does in a way I am upset with him but I don't know whether to  keep it to myself he was supposed to come over this afternoon and we  would spend all day together but oh well he was doing something earlier  with his friends dad just called and emily is going on a date I wish I  met the boy but emily likes him a lot it's weird to think that I was younger than emily when kyle and I started going out and we have been together ever since i love kyle ummmmmm I want to get icq on the internet to talk to aunt  debbie all the time I wish I could see kristin and melissa and brooke and  other friends that I miss a lot we are all going to homecoming though and we'll have some crazy stories I'm sure I hope kyle gets here soon should I change my clothes to go out or wear this I don't know hmm maybe I'll call kristine tomorrow and we'll do something together who knows maybe I'll call amy she is so nice and fun to be around oh and I have to see jennifer in psy class monday because at a party we found out that we were in the same class I thing that is really cool I want all of my classes to be interesting and not too hard man I'm kind of worried about all the classes and tests and exams and stuff but I am so excited about the football games that are starting in a week they will be so much fun to go to I'm sure more fun than high school football games but I don't know I'll probably miss being in the drill team and dancing at half time I wonder if PROPNAME is trying out for the dance team here or not she would definitely make it she is so awesome at dancing I hope she tries out and is really successful to show sarah g. that she can do anything that last year just wasn't for her in majesties I'm done it's been 00 minutes yeah!! 
__label__label1 I didn't go to class this morning. I feel really bad for not going, it's the first class I've missed so far. It was only Calculus-I'm not having any trouble in that class so far. I'm having the most trouble in Chemistry. I hate Chemistry. I almost wish my major was different so that I wouldn't have to take it. I took it in high school and I had trouble with it there. College is so much better than high school. Everyone said that once I was in college, I would wish I was back in high school-I don't wish that yet!  I really hated high school I'm so glad I'm not there anymore. Senior year was the worst-especially towards the end. I did so bad in school then. I can't believe I still got into LOCNAME. I didn't think I was going to get in. I remember when I found out-it was a Wednesday night and I made my brother check my status at LOCNAME on the internet. he didn't want to because I had been making him check it everyday for the past week and it always said that they were still reviewing my application. this time it said they had accepted me we were so excited no on e was there though just me, my brother and my boyfriend- he was asleep on the couch though and I woke him up to tell him and he didn't even act like he cared he just kind of grunted and went back to sleep-he's always like that though he never thinks anything I do that I'm proud of is really all that great anyway the night I found out was the night before me my brother my boyfriend and my best friend left for spring break vacation in LOCNAME LOCNAME. That vacation was so fun!! except I was sick the whole time so that sucked the food was so gross 
__label__label0 Naturally, since I am a college student, I should be focused on my college education, but my mind seems to be in other places right now. I went home over the summer and ended up meeting a wonderful person. That person and I became very close over the summer and ended up dating for a while. I am a guy and I never thought that I would be able to meet a guy that I could have such strong feelings for. We spent so much time together. I would go to work every morning at 0 am , and I would usually get out at about 0pm. After work, we would go running together. which served two purposes - exercise and spending time together. Well, the summer went by really fast and by the time I knew it, it was time for me to return to LOCNAME. It was really hard to say goodbye to him but eventually I had to do it. On my way up to LOCNAME, I stopped at his house and he had made me breakfast. We ate and talked for a while. I did not want to stay there too long or else I would end up arriving in LOCNAME too late. So I said goodbye. which was one of the hardest things I have had to do in a long while. besides tell my parents that I am gay. I don't think I am the same person after I met him. I have learned how to express my feelings more openly. I used to be so scared to express my feelings to anyone. probably because the people I used to date were girls. and deep down inside I was not happy with them. Now that I have experienced being with someone, and being happy with someone else. I want to feel like that all of the time, but the problem is that he is back home. and keeping a long distance relationship has been really hard. We decided to "break it off", and so he has been on my mind lately. which has contributed to my procrastination on this assignment. Anyway, this seems like a dumb thing to talk about. and I honestly can't believe I submitted this for an assignment. but it kind of helped to "write" it out. and hopefully I can get this out of my mind and focus on the more important aspects of my life right now. . 
__label__label0 You all are going to read this and say, Who the heck is this freak? The first day of the semester. I¹m tired already. I want to change to world half the time and it¹s not at all working. I hate people sometimes and I like them the next. How can people lie to you, straight to your face and still not have any trouble what so ever sleeping. Have we no morals at all? All I can think of as I return once again to the glorious LOCNAME campus is how everyone is just paying to party; paying to drink, dance and meet people. I want to learn, but I want to have fun too. I can¹t believe that all anyone thinks about anymore is the same old same old; drugs-alcohol, sex and rock and roll okay so maybe it¹s more R&B now a days. I must be warped. I want someone to tell me yeah it was a great weekend because I got to go here or there and I met with my friend so and so. Not Hey it was a great weekend, I got some chick to come back to my dorm and I got plastered. What is that? Am I the only one who thinks this way? I can¹t be. It just can¹t be that rare that I would be the only one who would want to do something besides drink and party 00/0. I must be jaded. Yes, I¹m a junior. Yes I¹ve been here a lot longer than half of these kids, fish, in our PSY class. But still, the campus is still a new place to me. Everyday is something new. I learn something new. I meet a new person. Something, anything. But something tangible. I¹m not talking about some whim like bouncing from party to party. Being pseudo friends and all. I try to be genuine. I don¹t lie to people. I¹m friendly damn it. I used to like people. People made me this way. All the mean rotten people in this world who want to lie to my face, cheat me out of my rights or just blatantly go out of their way to be rude and downright spiteful. How rude is that? I can¹t believe what our society has come to be. I can¹t wait to start learning how some people think. What makes our brain tick. Why am I the way I am. Why  that mean lady who cut me off right on my way home is the way she is, like she didn¹t see my blinker, that¹s what that stupid little light is for. I didn¹t pay extra to just have extra decorations on my car. As if. Then she honks at me, like I was in the wrong, she knows she was speeding up to close the gap. How rude! I want to know why they think this way. Is this like the beginning of all of this Armageddon story. Is that what the 00st century is bringing our way. Why are we all fighting. And why am I so cynical when I¹m only 00. I should still be a naive little student who loves the world and everyone in it. But still. There are such things as being right and being wrong. What ever happen to a person¹s word? I want to know. There has to be others like me who think this way. I¹m not the only one who thinks we¹re wasting our time here. There are more important things to do in our world than worry about which frat is having the next party and whose dating who and all of that petty stupid little gossip things that buzz around the world everyday. You know it happens. It starts every morning at the water cooler or something like that and people just begin their little digs for the day. What is it with us. I hope humans weren¹t always this stupid, because let me tell you we¹re at a downfall here; crime, attitudes, lying, no morals, all of that. You know what I¹m talking about, don¹t you computer? I¹m babbling. I just want everything to make sense. It doesn¹t now. I don¹t know. I want the world to change, but how can it, when will it, what are we going to do. . . 
__label__label0 what a waste of time. These guys are so hung on the fact that they can't decide whether they want to be this one or that one or if they can hack it. How stupid. it is really loud in the other room and I hate when people have their deadlocks one and leave the door open so it always slams when it closes. What should I do about mike? It is a really confusing situation. I wish that gabe would ask me out again. Smoking is bad. PROPNAME just asked PROPNAME PROPNAME if he wanted to go smoke and it's gross. To relieve stress about all this frat shit. Racism is bad. I don't understand why can't people just respect the fact that everyone is not going to be the same color as them. I am open-minded about it because I lived over seas and sometimes I wish that people would be able to have this experience so that they could understand  a little bit about another culture. You learn a lot about your lifestyle and your own country when you are not surrounded about it the whole time. But right now I don't feel surrounded. PROPNAME is still probably crying over his ex-girlfriend and I feel his pain I have been through that before with PROPNAME, I wish here was here a lot of the time but I guess he isn't. he is probably with carley having sex which sucks for me to be thinking about because I think she is a really bad influence on him. I just hope he takes care of himself and doesn't screw up too bad at ORGNAME since he already screwed up by even going there. Imagine that . to be an Aggie that would suck but I guess in a sense I am being prejudice against the ORGNAME. They are a whole different culture but I hate to be called a hypocrite. Someone called me today and it was my best friend in the whole world. Cole is the man. I miss him so much and a lot of the time  I wish that I has a friend as close to me here as he was to me. He is at westpoint and I feel bad for him, no sleep and lots of pressure to do well. I hope he is ok. I miss him and he needs my prayers, which I need to do. I got to get back into the swing of things,. I would be letting Cole down if he knew where I am at with God right now, he is my accountability partner and I feel as though I am letting him down by not studying the word. I will probably go to LOCNAME on Tuesday though and hopefully I will take someone with me. Maybe PROPNAME will go. I hope so, I wonder how sarah and wade are. I miss seeing here and was pretty mean sometimes. brad on the other hand seems very worried about his job and I scared for him! We clicked really well at work and I wish we could spend some quality time together sometime but I don't know what he has been up to ?  I got to go to bed soon. I was very stupid about waiting till the last minute to do homework but I do it all the time and I don't know why I surprise myself every time that I wait until the last minute to do stuff. speaking of which I need a job. where the heck am I going to get a job. I need money to pay for crap that I don't need, Like sweats and shoes that I would add to the collection of almost 00. PROPNAME just walked in the door and I knew because I recognized her voice. She is weird but in a great way. only 0 minutes I think. it seems like twenty minutes is such a short time when you are babbling your thoughts to a computer. PROPNAME is weird and he has this annoying laugh that drives me nuts. So does PROPNAME but PROPNAME's is cute, or am I just trying to justify it because I think I like him. probably I do that a lot. I can convince myself that something is good when it isn't and the exact opposite. It sucks. I never know whether to believe myself or not to. Just like when I talk about sex, I don't want to have sex until I am married and I have made a  commitment to not only myself and God but to my future mate. Wow that is scary. thinking about marriage. " just what every girl dreams of. their wedding day. " But I hate to be out in the category 'every girl' I am my own person and I feel like I am unique. 
__label__label1 I have a lot of work I need to get done with today, and for some reason I'm kind of I the mood to do my homework. You don't know me so you don't know how uncommon this kind of mood is for me. It's like when I finally decided to clean up my room, and it was just so satisfying to get the job done. I already went home for a weekend, and I went straight to my room just to look at how clean it is. It's a very satisfying feeling to know that it's that clean because of me. I kind of miss my family, my friends, my life before I got here. And I just can't stop thinking about this. Today I was walking with my boyfriend, and this guy that I thought was really cute saw me walking with him. It's not like I was planning on dumping my boyfriend for this random guy, but I wouldn't have minded if he hadn't necessarily known that I was attached. Maybe I could've had some fun. But really I truly love my boyfriend, but things are going well, but they could always end up changing. My goal is just that I don't want to miss out on anything in college. I want to date around while I've go the chance. if some guys want to date me, that is. Tonight I'm going to this thing, I can't remember the name of it though: it's like the Christian organization for the whole campus. I'm not really sure how into it I'll be. I go to church and teach Sunday school, or at least I used to. I haven't gone to church in LOCNAME yet, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. But I don't know if this Christian thing is my kind of thing. I'm not one of those people that likes to go around trying to get people to take God into their lives. That's their choice as far as I'm concerned. I mainly decided to go to this meeting to meet some new people, and so I could do something since PROPNAME's going to be so busy today with his computer science homework. I can't complain too much though because if it wasn't for PROPNAME I wouldn't have computer up and working. I was getting kind of frantic about this assignment. I just wanted to get it done, but I just didn't have everything together. Right now I'm becoming all impressed with my typing skills. I have to look at the keyboard the entire time, but I can press the keys pretty fast. I'm quite pleased. On Saturday I'm going out to one of my family's lake houses. It's on LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they are about to sell it which makes me pretty sad. I love that place mainly cause it is so unique to have a place like that to go to. It's sad because I didn't realize how lucky I was to have that so I didn't always go when I  had the chance and it's so nice and peaceful. There's another lake house on PROPNAME PROPNAME and I really o prefer that one, but I'd rather them not sell either one. People are like protesting the sell of this property because we're selling it to developers, and that makes all of the neighbors angry. I can understand that, but I have no part in the decision making. But at least for part of this weekend I won't be stuck eating crappy Jester food. I think I'm almost to tw0enty minutes, and I kind of feel bad because I don't feel like I just wrote what came to mind. It seems planned for some reason, UT I never paused this whole time, I just kept typing and would always seem to come up with something to say, well I guess it's good-bye until my next assignment, but now I'm wondering if my assignment is as long as everyone else's. Maybe I type slower than them and maybe it hasn't quite been twenty minutes. I can't exactly remember when I actually started this, but I kind of do need to go because I have plenty of Calculus homework to do. It's not like you're even going to read this, but I'm still kind of nervous. oh well, I'm going to say I'm done now. 
__label__label0 PROPNAME PROPNAME, what exactly is this showing me again?  That I can't find anything better else to do than avoid going to work?  Great. Oh well, that's life I suppose. I don't really think I'm a cynic, but you're the psyc here, so after your reading this, please consider that I'm a cynic only for humor, not because I hate the world or anything. You're reading the thoughts of someone who is a huge fan of people like PROPNAME PROPNAME, now how can you be a fan of PROPNAME PROPNAME without being a fan of cynicism? Well, what other great questions I'm I to ask during my 00 minutes?  Who the hell knows. I'm listening to one of the few Beatles songs that really just nag at my thought train right now, and I can't change the damn station because I have to keep typing. Isn't this just perfect?  Well, I suppose that too is just part of the assignment. I use to like this song, "Hello" I thin is the name of it. "You say goodbye, I say hello" I'm sure you know it. It just occurred to e that I'm writing to you, such that this would be a letter, well, I don't think that was supposed to be the way it was intended, you're probably looking for that in my letter you some sort of study, eh?  Well, I guess chalk up one for the "he wrote this assignment like it was a letter" category. I do that sometimes I suppose. Just kind of drift off into something not quite exactly like what I'm supposed to be doing. I think it's quite alright, however. I don't see how I'll get anywhere interesting in life doing what only is 'supposed' to be done. So, I suppose. wow, I sure do say 'suppose' a lot in my head. What's that a sign of Mr. PROPNAME? Maybe one day, I'll be able to pull out a book and write off to people what they seem to fit into according to famous psychologists. Hopefully not though. Hopefully I'll have enough common sense to understand the person, their feelings, and my experiences will guide me to a conclusion on how to help them help themselves without any drugs or unnecessary qualification into a group that some ancient shrink made up. Wow, just in time to look at the clock, looks like I'm almost half way there. I wonder if anyone else in the class types this fast. If not, I bet mine's the longest. I seem to have a somewhat active mind, and since I'm typing fast enough to record a good deal of the thoughts I'm encountering, I should have one of the longer entrees. Not that that is a good or bad I thing, I don't *suppose* Look there, I even had time to put in those neat little asterisks to emphasize that I used the word suppose again. How cute. This thing has to be several hundred words by now. I think I think in short-blocks sometimes. I'm not to sure if that's good or bad. The advantage of short-blocks would be that I'm moving on from one thing to another associated thing pretty quickly, meaning that I'm not stagnating in my thoughts. However, a stagnation in thought can cause a nicer, deeper, if you will, reflection on the topic. Usually this allows me to get to a bit further point in the conversation with myself. I wonder what I'm going to eat for lunch. I'm really not to sure. I've got to go to work. Or at least I should. I could use the extra money. rrGeeze, I could dick those guys around so hard and they'd still ask me to come back. You have to understand that I'm pretty damn good at what I do, and my co-workers and supervisors all realize this. So, when it comes time for me to go back to school, they all say, "oh well, you're going to at least stay on par time, right, PROPNAME?" Well, I'd really rather not stay there, I'm quite tired of their inability to do much at all properly. But, money is money, and where else am I going to find someone to pay me part-time hours (00 a week) and get $00. 00/hr for it. I don't have a degree or nothing substantial to demand a higher pay somewhere else. Just knowledge. I suppose if "Proct" was some science that not too many people about, then you wouldn't be able to get a degree in "Proct" so people would have to hire you simply on how much you knew. Well, that's the way my job is. Granted there are related fields to mine where a degree or a certification can help your resume. But not what I do specifically. So, have you guessed what my field is yet?  I've given several clues. I'm now listening to the ORGNAME ORGNAME's song "Jessica"  It's a great tune. They just jam along to it, but you can tell a piece of someone's love is in that song. I mean, someone laid a piece of their soul into he music, and when they recorded it, it carried right over into it. The kind of music where you get a chill running down your spine, and then you realize what a good mood you're in. You can have chill-sending songs that are sad, but 'I like the happy ones, they are fewer in number than the sad ones. "Jessica" is clearly about a girl, and a girl and a love that made someone very happy. I hope they enjoyed their time together though, because it sounds like the author is just reminiscing. Like it was a summer love or something a bit stronger than that. really like the idea though. Very nice all the way around. A summer love that was beautiful and both enjoyed, but for some 0rd party reason, they had to step aside and let fate take its course, and take them away from each other. It's the definition of looking back on the good times, not the bad. It's not an easy thing to do, you must admit, it takes practice to only see the good parts. But also still keep the bad parts in mind for reference. It's like a library, your memory. In proper shape, it lets you check out the good memories to take and enjoy. But the bad memories are reference only. That way you can't get too bogged down in them. Or at least that's the way I try to keep mine setup. What do you think?  Probably think I'm a silly little kid trying to edge philosophy into an assignment to impress you?  Not really, the thought occurred to me, but how would that help me?  Besides, wouldn't be very honest now would it? Lots of rhetorical questions there, eh?  Well, I've only got a few seconds left. So know that all this is straight out of my mind, and frighteningly enough, it's this active all the time. I may just be sitting somewhere, but I'm thinning away. Surely a PROPNAME thinks that's good, right. All done. 00 minutes right up there. 
__label__label0 I'm not so sure how I felt about it yet. Not that it was bad or anything, but I'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. It seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. Mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. But than again, I guess the experiments that I did this for will probably deal with those issues. I really don't know why I tried to do that survey right when I got up this morning, I just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, I finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 0 times. That was a little frustrating. There is something else that's really bothering me right now also. Nothing to do with school, but socially. I live in LOCNAME, and hate to say it, but I am a pretty stereotypical LOCNAMEn kid. I mention this because I have this burning passion for the ocean. Even most people who live in LOCNAME don't feel as deeply about it as I do. I knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when I came to school, but I didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. Well anyway, I really miss the ocean. Every night I try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. When I walk to class I even feel it in my feet and legs. Just on their own my legs begin to surf. The same muscle motions, I guess they call it muscle memory. I can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. Or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. That's all I live for. or lived for. LOCNAME seems to have stopped my love for a little while. No I take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, I guess LOCNAME just got in the way for a little while. That's where my problem comes up socially. I now realize that if you're not in California, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. I feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. Like I said, the perfect stereotype. I guess I wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how I felt. How the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. It's a way of life, not just a social activity. It's a culture, and it's become who I am. Not just surfing. I love it but that is only one small facet of why I love the ocean. I just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times I've had there. Whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 000 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. Skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. Just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. The ocean can do all of that. But people don't seem to realize that. I love LOCNAME, well I don't know if I love LOCNAME. but I definitely love ORGNAME, it's just that I have to sacrifice so much more that I realized that I would have to do. I came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. That's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. It's not that I feel like I'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. But I just wish people would have the same opportunities as I did, or have. I want them to fall in love as I did. But that's impossible if you stay in LOCNAME for a lifetime. Come to think of it, I really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, I think I'm going to do that today. I've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that I lost sight of the one back in SD. I'm going to make a promise to myself that I will never lose touch of what I left back home, or the people that I left. Just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as I continue to grow, and add to those memories here. 
__label__label0 I don't know how other people (freshmen) are coping with this new transition from high school to college; I feel stress out. Hmm. maybe I'm not so completely at ease like I had claimed earlier. I suppose that I am at ease at this moment is because I don't have any class to go to for hours, and that I think I am at ease right now, is because this is the second week of classes. However, I'm still stress, very much so. (I feel like I'm rambling on and on here. ) I am so very much relief that I have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments. I like to try to do things ahead of time so that I won't be in any jams later on. Besides, what with the way my schedule is set, I have to budget my time wisely. Moreover, I am worried that I won't be able to get high grades as I did when I was in high school. Everything in college is so very different and challenging. Sometimes, I feel as if I can't keep up with other people. I admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them. I just can't do that. I'm the type that has to put in "extra work" so that I can keep up with them. I'm not saying that I'm stupid, gosh no! I believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways. Hmmm. there is one thing, rather, one small minor fear  that I just can't seem to overcome: fear of animals, especially dogs. Well, I took the pretest and in there, it had asked me questions about animal phobia. I really want to know what these fears mean, which brings me to another thought. I always have questions, such questions that are so detailed some people called it "stupid questions. " I always find myself having questions about everything. I guess  I'm just a curious person. Hmmmm. I guess this is enough typing for this assignment. I can't think of anything else to write about. Who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment, I'm sorry it isn't anything that is as exciting as you'll like it to be. 
__label__label0 I just got ORGNAME the phone with my best friend PROPNAME from home (LOCNAME, Md) and it was weird because she hasn't left for school yet - she is going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME - so When I talk to her we are coming from such different perspectives right now and it is really strange since we have always been so similar in everything before. We were talking about our other good friend PROPNAME who is going to ORGNAME and has been there for about the same amount of time that I have been here and she was saying how she has been talking to her everyday but that Meryl is so happy and has so many friends and even a new boyfriend and I was saying how that is really weird and annoying because I honestly am pretty happy and having what I think is a fairly normal adjustment to college but I don't have like a real group of friends yet or anything and it isn't everything that I had hoped college would be yet, but I figure that I have only been here for two weeks. PROPNAME was saying that what she thinks is so weird about it though is that Meryl says that she goes out everynight and loves school and everything but she calls her everyday and I say that I am still adjusting etc and I don't even have time to talk to her everyday. I don't know, I just think that it is really annoying and try not to talk to Meryl too much because it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me since things aren't going quite as well for me and it makes me feel sort of bitter towards her. Tonight I went out to dinner with my friend PROPNAME who I met when I went on LOCNAME LOCNAME and I love. We went to the Hula Hut and it was really good because I had really been away from Campus and the whole UT thing since I got here and I was sort of starting to feel like  I was stuck in a bubble and out of touch with reality so it was good to get away for a little bit. Plus, the food was really good and I hadn't had a real good meal since I got here either. It also made me more sure that I had made the right decision about going home for a the weekend of Sept. 00-00 (for the jewish holiday) because I saw that it was good to be in car and get away and realized that it would definately be good for me to get away for a longer period of time. Before I went to dinner tonight I was worried that I wouldn't want to go because I would feel like I was missing things here but now I see that I definately did make the right decision. Also when I go home I am going to drive up to LOCNAME for the night to see PROPNAME and when I was talking to her it sounded like she was really excited to see me so that is good too. I feel like I should be really stressed right now about schoolwork and everything with this being my first semester of college and my first time at a big, public school since I attended a small private high school but I honestly feel like I have less work then I did in high school and that it is easier - plus I am really staying on top of it. The only concern that I am having at all is the size of my classes (all of them have over 000 people in them) because I am used to being in classes with about 00 people in them and recieving a lot of focused attention from my teachers and although I am not concerned about this affecting my performance as I feel that I am completely capable on my own, I am worried I will be overlooked and just be a number in crowd - which I'm sure that I will be in a lot of my classes, at least for a while. So far though I like my classes at least and find them interesting and all of my professors do seem to be pretty interesting and approachable. I also rushed and am pledging a sorority which, even though I really like it and am happy that I did it is becoming more and more time consuming and I getting worried that I am going to have trouble completing everything that I need to do for that but I am sure that it will not be as tough as I am expecting. Right now I am listening to a really good CD that PROPNAME sent me that our friend PROPNAME made for me and it is so good because it is a mix that he made of all of these really good old songs plus a couple of good new ones. I have three minutes left to write now and I am really running out of things to say except that earlier I found a cricket or grasshopper or something in my room and it is really gross and I don't know how it got up here because I like on the 00th floor of dobie and there are no windows but it is totally gross and I am definately going to file a complaint and tell the front desk that I need an exterminator or something. Well I think that my time is up now so bye. 
__label__label1 so here I am trying to figure out what it is that I am thinking. maybe I shouldn't have given advice to genevieve about her mother. I don't  really know the situation and even more than that the little that I do know. I have never experienced. adrian too. he must really be having a difficult time dealing with the death of his mother. man, my finger really hurts. the manicurist was trying to drill my cuticles off. but they're pretty. I don't know what I should do with the whole beta thing. they are all nice, but I am tired of being pressured into situations that I am not comfortable. maybe I set myself up for it. right now I am a little emabrassed because I am really hungry and these 00 minutes are not passing quick enough. I know the instructions say not to worry about grammer and spelling, but it's really hard to read my own writing and have all these misspelled words pop up. nose itches. I wonder if I will be able to handle rush and my classes. as it is I am already blowing off my other classes for organic. even more than that, I hope I get my financial \aid in on time. I really do feel bad about making my father feel like he wasn;t there for me. my mom says that it'll work itself out but this whole financial crap really is upsetting. I know of families that have been torn apart beacuse of that. all I know is that they'll have my ass until I am like 00. which really sucks. an education shouldn't be so expensive that once you get one and start a job you are so in the hole that you're broke all the time. maybe I should drop out and og to massage therapy school like I wanted to a long time ago. I can't believe  that I haven't heard from dannee. I am really upset about what our friendship has become. sometimes I even think of andy and I don;t know why. he's probably happily married with a kid. (I am really glad that it's not my kid, though. cause then I'd really be screwed with the whole moiney thing) 0 more minutes. I can't believe how little I have written. I must be the slowest typer. there's my stomach again. at least I don't have any classes today. that way I can print up my organic and biology and go home to eat. even when I get there I don't know how to react with genevieve. she complains about her mother and then does the exact thing that she complains about. I bet I do the same thing. wow that guy is really talking very loud. I wonder why (0 minutes) people walk aroiund libraries talking so loud. how inconsiderate. I even had a wierd dream last night. but I think if I were to think about it now my finers would not be able  to type quick enough to write it in the last couple of minutes. I wonder who called us this morning at like 0:00. good thing I was able to fall back to sleep. 
__label__label1 I am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. I don't know if I made the right decisin in coming here, I guess that's because people keep on asking me where I an from and when I say LOCNAME they all ask me why I transfered and why I came here, as if LOCNAME is so amazing and this place sucks. I guess LOCNAME is pretty amazing in some ways. But it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. Added to that I don't like knowing everyone, well I like knowing people but I don't like it when you have no aninimity. I also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, I guess that goes without saying. I feel like I have to step up my game and almost go out "hunting" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. It's not terrible romantic, but I'm getting pretty desperate. There are some hot hot girls here. I don't know what's my problem, It's probably because I live in LOCNAME which is on the other end of the earth. That's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. Although it is a lot easier when your living with them. It's not so bad I've meet some women here, but the one that I am more serious with, I don't find myself attracted to at all. She's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but I really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. It's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. But I really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from LOCNAME. No I really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. I need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem. But I really want to go out with PROPNAME, she is a goddess on earth, she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous. I can't belive it, and I act like such a dork around her but she doesn't seem to mind, and that's what I loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot, I must do eveything in my power to win her I must put the wheels in motion before she gets snatched up, because I know that if I don't act soon and I mean like in the next five minutes, some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what I see and I cannnot let that happen not this time, I've let that happen too many times in the past I've let every girl that I've ever had feelings for get away. And PROPNAME may be the one, she's in the fricking Pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that I am, but if I were with her I would not let that happen. I would do everything for her, I would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her. I have my mission, I must develop my plan, and somewhere in between I must get some studying done. Straight A's and PROPNAME that will be the story of my life for this year. 
__label__label1 What am I feeling right now, hmmmmmmm. my consciousnesss. Right now it's the afternoon and I'm feeling pretty hungry. My stomach feels pretty empty and I think I can fill it up w\ a lot of food. My feelings and thoughts are pretty mixed up right now. There is so much going on. My mind is on so many things. there is so much to do. first I'm thinking about a girl that I was with and I left because of school. then I have to get my books for class. I still haven't fit in and I don't feel relaxed yet because of the things I have to do. I'm worried about if my financial aid is ever going to come through so I can pay for the books. Those books cost a lot of money. But this overpowering hunger of mine is really taking up a lot of my thoughts. somehow, though I am able to pull those really tiny thoughts which are really important. Man, I don't know what else. It's pretty crazy that I am here in LOCNAME away from H-town, but next weekend I'll be able to go back home the hunger . man I wish I had eaten a lot earlier, all I had was some lasagna leftover. I can't believe I'm writing or typing for this long and straight because my forearm is starting to hurt. oh well, got to keep writing I hope this psychology class isn't so hard, that pretest was pretty damn long w\ thirty -two pages. the reason why there are no spelling mistakes is because I don't like to have errors, sorry. I wonder what the point of this is? their not going to check it. what are they going to do to this hmmmm. interesting I wonder what I'm going to write to her I miss everybody. my forearm really hurts I want to stop but there's only a few minutes left. right after this I'm going to the pulse and getting my money to get my books. I think UT is awesome, there is so many possibilities. these computers in the business school are pretty awesome too. hurry up time . I like this asssignment though, I like it a lot. I still don't get the freakin' assignments to the freakin' calculus class. I'm glad I was able to  drop English is the twenty minutes almost up yet?!!!! Holy crap. the veins on my forearms are poppin' out. Beautiful babies everywhere pennebaker cool. Hi there. this is me killing time . I have a lot more thoughts but I'm hungry and myforearm hurts. I'm typing w\one finger now. its almost up. this thing makes me sleepy. one minute left. yessss. wwhhhhooooeeee!!let'sgo it;'s over 
__label__label1 ok, so my grandfather died yesterday. why don't I feel sad yet. what is wrong with me, do I have no conscionce?  When my mother told my sister and I, she told us like we should pitty her, not like we should also be sad, what the f*** he was my grandfather. it was all about her, when can you come down to houston to watch the animals, so I can go to the funeral, not, do you wnat to come with me to the funeral?  how can she possible be so selfish. but then look at me, I am so busy being angry, I haven't had a chance to be sad yet. what if I don't get sad?  Is that bad?  Am I a bad person?  I only saw him once every couple of years, if that. I didn't really know him,  and when I did see him he was very generous, but also a real jerk. his intensions were always really good, but he always was very bosy and rude. I remember once when I was like 0 we went out to eat, and he yelled at the waitress because they didn't seat us fast enough. but, last year when he came to my graduation we went out to eat . oh had a thought. My sister and I were thinking about him the night before he died. thinking about how he is always so concerned with us, like for example, he always focused in on something important to us, like when I was a vegitarian he always sent we cook books and when I danced he always called me his little princess or his little ballerina. this continued for years, he never forgot. . when we went out to eat for my graduation he was so polite to the waiter, and even joked with him 
__label__label1 First of I would like to clear something up. Yes you did pay for ORGNAME's but for the money you paid I wore PROPNAME and Target clothes and ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also hardly think that the $00 a month you paid for me equates to the Hundreds you pay for PROPNAME. Second I paid for that Fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at ORGNAME. In no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. I did earn a lot of money this summer. I spent very little of it and saved most of it - so YOU wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. I don't think having a car is a sign of love- I think it is a sign of favoritism. That's what makes me cry and get really upset. The two main reason's PROPNAME got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and Dad obviously identifies with him more. Nevermind that I try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. I guess maybe if I act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one I could get a little appreciation in this family. Having a car here is imparactical and honestly, I don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. The damamge is done. My whole life I felt loved and I'm not saying I don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. I was very upset. Not that I didn't mean what I wrote, but I could of said it in a kinder way. I had a really long talk about it with Will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. The reason I get so upset is not because I want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. Logically I know it means nothing, but I still hurt when I think about it. I'm really confused. I think I get emotional about it because I think it's so unfair, I can't do anything about it, and I get so mad I cry. Another thing I have observed is I can't talk to dad about it. I don't know why I feel it necessary to "protect him" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. I guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that "he couldn't afford it" I can't even really talk about it with you; I have to write about it. I guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I get sad about it because I don't understand why I feel this way and no one understands my feelings. I really meant it when I said I didn't know what could return me to the way I felt before the incident. And all the while I'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. I was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. Here, no one LOVES me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that I was SURE of at home. The car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why I'm upset about it. I KNOW that objects don't measure love. It's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. I guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. This letter itself is really ironic in some way. I write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here I am up at midnight worrying about yours. well I'm going to bed now, I've got school and work tomorrow. 
__label__label0 uh how much time do I have today is a busy day I am hungry, when will I eat I haven't taken a shower yet and I'm going out to eat after class with my brother and sister I don't like business I should just drop ba000 I I want to go to kevin's birthday party this is a weird assign mient metro is a cool place to study I should go there more often I love my dorm room I miss my mom's food I want to go home for a day this weekend I still haven't gone to zilker park jake should get out of that frat while he can before he pays any dues at least john is in over his head I wonder if he'll be able to handle all that I hope my brother is okay in the peace core I wish I was closer to him and karen they aren't like me I miss purdy and buddy last night was fun I need to quit going out    so much but I like my friends they make me feel less stressed I hate that business school building it sucks why am I a business major I hate math and I don't really like science all that much art is where I am psychology os so interesteng how do you just decide to be a forest ranger kevin is cool as shit I  am tired I love sleeping I wonder what all these strange dreams are about I know they mean something I am hungry or do I just want to eat why do I eat so much maybe cause I haven't been smoking as much so you smoke and kill your lungs or you eat and get fat that sucks I just need to stay busier and I won't eat as much I should get a job then I will stay thin fuck the freshman fifteen and I'll have some of my own money then I can go to miami should I transfer to a university in miami cause I love miami I miss it the rain it rained every day a nd it never rains here never rains rock yards palm trees and exotic plants beck is the shit he is so unique I wish I could meet him I wish I would meet some people like me here or some people that would be entertaineg all these white-bred frat boys and sorority girls are faking it all be real and it will be fine take care of this school stuff cause that's why I'm here I wonder what's on t. v. that t. v is bad for studying I can't believe I studied unitl 0 I miss dennis I am worried about him and james and mikey they are fucking it all up for themselves and they don't admit it I know they know it but they won't realize it why don't they just move on out of killeen it is hard though when you have frinds like that it's hard for me to make new friends now because they were such good friends that it seems no one will compare but what made them such good friends maybe they just changed me I need a cigarette but it's too hot outside to be smoking I want to check my email why dosn't anyone stop and notice me I thought that austin would be cool like that eceryone's so friendly in miami but not really , just friendlier to me cause I'm blonde five more minutes that business shit sucks I need to decide what my major should be art?

__label__label0 We got a new couch today in our dorm room, I think that I like it but it has a kind of weird smell to it. I put some febreeze on it , I mean what can you expect from a 00 dollar garage sell couch. I am becoming kind of concerned about the study habits that I am developing here in LOCNAME. It seems that every day I do nothing and at night I realize that I have all this work to do and that I have not actually done any of it. I stay up late doing work and don't get enough sleep. So all day I feel tired. I wish that I had not ate so much tody. My stomach is seriously hurting me. I think that since I have come to Austin I am still eating a lot but I have stopped all physical activity. I really should go to the gym or go running or atleast get some of the guys around here to go play some basketball or something. I feel realy guilty right now, I was supposwd to go to churh tonite at 00, but I didn't get back from eating out with my friends until around 00. My mom called me after I had got in and I told her that I had gone at ten and that I was just getting back. I don't feel so bad about lying as I really do about not going. I consider myself to be afairly devote ORGNAME, this is the first time that I can remember not going to church on a sunday. I tried to remember, I was sure that I had missed atleast once before, but I thought about it for along time and this is the first time in forever that I have not been on a sunday. I'm thinking right now how easier it would be to write this if my roomate and his girlfriend were not here. I keep feeling like they are reading what I am writing, and I think that I am right, those bastards, just kiddin they are both reallygood friends. They just called me out on calling them bastards, they thought it was kind of funny. They just put on mtv, man I hate the Backstreet boys. And that would be 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 Right now I am kind of in pain. Someone feel backwards in their chair and fell on my leg and scraped it. It stings a little, but it will be okay. I've been trying to do the pre-testing, but it won't let me on. I'll try to do it later. I like the internet because it is great that I can look things up on it. It's cool that I can look at notes from my classes. It's a good thing, but yet I still hate it because I do not have a computer and my roomates is not working for some reason. It is really annoying because I have to leave my room to get on the internet. It is also a pain because I can never get on when I want to. Like the pre-testing that I just tried to do, why can I never get on?  Oh well, I guess I will have to try later. My roomate and I are really getting along great. The only thing that is a problem is that she goes to bed at 0:00 at night. I can't go to sleep that early. Last night I had homework and she did not. I felt so bad because I had lights on and was making noises. I feel bad, but if I have homework I can't worry about her. so far, I really like ORGNAME. My mom wanted me to be an Aggie, but I decided I would much rather be a Longhorn. My mom thinks this school is to bg for me. She thinks I have the personality of an Aggie, because I am so shy. My mom even offered to pay for a sorrority so I would make friends. My mom can't even afford this school. I think I have made a lot of friends though. I am shy, but it's not like I am mute. I am afraid that my mom is going to be really lonely now that I am gone. She is the only one in the house and does not go out with her friends much. My sister lives close by, but is to busy. She is the total opposit of me, she is a social butterfly. She is 00, but acts 00. I heard that you can use your meal plan money at the Jester store, I wonder if it's true. If it is that would be really cool. I could really go for some pizza right now. I should go to the store and get some frozen pizzas. That would be good for Sunday night when the cafeteria is closed. I think the Kinsolving cafeteria is better than Jester's. They have a great selection and the pizza is really good there. There is one guy that works there that is really nice. He is allways smiling. I think it's cool that they have ice cream there. I love ice cream sandwiches. They are really good. It was hard to decide if I wanted to live in Jester or Kinsolving. The rooms are much nicer at LOCNAME than at Jester. I love the big window. Jester has a tiny window and the walls are pale. Jester on the other hand has a great location. It is close to everything and everyone lives there. You allways run into people you know and it's easy to get a bunch of friends together for lunch and dinner. I feel bad because I got my roomate sick, and 0 of my friends. oops!  Well I have three minutes left. I wanted to go home this weekend, but I can't. I did'nt go last week because of the football game and my sister came to visit. I can't go home this weekend because my ride's car's air-conditioning broke. I know noone will take me home next weekend because of the football game. I wonder if I'll ever get to go back home!  Both of my parents are coming for parent's weekend. I wonder if they get to sit with me at the football game. I wish I had a computer, it would be so much easier. Well my time is up and I really have to go to the bathroom, so I guess I will go now. Bye!   
__label__label1 I'm really worried about shannon I wonder if shes going to be ok it scares me a lot. I'm never known anyone my age to have something serious like that. I wonder if it was cause by anything like a cell phone or living by a tower or whatever. it makes me wonder if that could happen to me. I'm not sure why people smoke. its such a disgusting habit, but people seem to do it because it looks cool and because other people are doing it. I could understand why people smoked in high school it made you bad or something but not it just hurts your health and makes you ugly. I need to go brush my teeth. I wonder what reid is doing. he is so hot, I really would like to get with him, and I'm starting to lose intrest in chris. I feel trapped by him. I love being able to call on him whenever I want to do something. he's sort of my conveinent boyfriend. I guess that's not fair to him, but I'd almost rather it just be this way. I have a voice mail. who could that be from. I wonder when they will fix my phone. I love talking on the phone. I miss my mom. I don't miss my dad. I wonder how to tell him not to come home for parents weekend. I hate him. he'll maake me fell miserable either way. they are coming to fix my phone. thank god. I wonder if my date tonight will be cute. I like that outfit I wore last night. I really love suzanne and kristin and kleigh. suzanne is so awesome, but I wish we were all in the same sorority. actually no I don't. this way we have 0 close friends from different sororities and I have becoem good friends with PROPNAME PROPNAME and tara. tara's awesome. I love all my sisters. I wonder what will happen when christy comes in town. I hope her and brian break up so I can set him up with someone. he's a good guy she doesn't deserve him. I think they're relationship is completely sexual. I wonder if I'll ever get married. I wonder if my dad will ruin that day for me too. I wonder if my mom will get married. I am embarassed of my parents sometmes. that makes me feel like such a bad person, but I can't help it. I love my mom. I wonder if anything bad will happen to brian because of those shirts he stole. I think that is so wrong. mike plays guitar. I wish I palyed guitar. acoustic not electric. I'd like to be able to play brown eyed girl. I wonder if I could be on staff for asp. I wonder if I could be a camp texas counselor. that counsleor that made me "hiney write" was awesome. he was a cool guy. doug is awful. I hope I never get played. I wonder if I'm playing chris. I would feel better if he would date someone else. god I wonder where reid is right now. he has no friday classes. my suitemates phone is ringing. are they up. do tehy have class. will she ever stop drinking?  I hope she learns to slow down. she's an alcoholic. that guy was not even cute. I should talk to her. kathryn is cool. I want kathryn to amke a painting for me. I like fruit loops. yum. are we out of milK?  damn I have to buy cheese. I want a quesdilla. why did that boy stop by at0?  what an idiot. I'm probably more likely to help him. I like the body builder next door. he likes me too. I wonder if PROPNAME PROPNAME and kyle talked about me. she seemed to be very curious about chris being my boyfriend or not. I feel like a bitch when I think this, but I wish kyle would shave his go-t. who arranged the keyboard?  why are they in this order. I think its easier to have it this way then in alphabetical order. you use the letters asdf allot. and jkl. and ert. I wonder if sesame street is on. I liked bert and ernie. there was an episode of my so called life where rayanne sang how to get to sesame street. it was awesome. I hate that girl from the tri-delt house. I don't' know why they don't like me. I wonder what to wear tonight. damn it I need to study. has it been 00 minuts. how come I don't have any hot professors?  I like ut. I don't want to drink anymore. am I going to get fat?  kleigh is cute. I wish I had her figure. some people are lucky. I love my bed. its so soft. its lunchtime I'm not hungry. I wish I were skinny like andrea. I wonder if wolfe likes me. I think I scared him last night with my story about the elevator. why do the elevatros ehre take so long. I can't believe what happened to me and chris in the elevator. that was so emabarssing, and yet I can smile/laugh at it. chris is cool. i have a lecutre to go to today. I have to read. I have to work out. I have to call whats his anem and tell him I can't go. I don't think kleigh will go. what to do. 
__label__label0 I am so happy to be home right now. College life is fun and all, but I miss the comforts of home. At the dorm, there is always something "extremely important" to do at every moment. Someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. I have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. I am getting so overwhelmed by it all. I suddenly have so many responsibilities. Like making sure I wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure I eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. And my current boy situation is so overwhelming. Suddenly, no that I am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. They are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. It is so weird to not have a boyfriend since PROPNAME and I were together for 00 months. To make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. Our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. I know that lots of girls feel the need to "find themselves" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before I actually was in their shoes. I mean, don't you know who you are? I thought that I did, but now that everything is so different, I feel very lost and confused about who I am and what types of values/morals I have. Up to this point, every decision I made was affected to some degree by my parents. For example, my 0 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where I went at night, how much sleep I got each night. Also, there were rules on who I went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. Now, I can come and go as I please with no questions asked. I'm not so sure that is a good thing. I mean, just because I am 00, that does not mean I suddenly competent to run my entire life. I miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. Although, I think that mom and I talk more now than when I lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. We talk almost five times a day. But it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when I am down. What is also so diffucult now is that when I need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. So, I am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that I have formed some sort of bond with. Friendships are difficult and delicat things. I know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. They take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. You cannot just jump in and say "Oh we are best friends now. " That is why soroity life is so strange now. I have been thrown into this new "family" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet I don't even know most of their names. I guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. However, I am thankful to have somewhere to go when I get lonely. Which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone. 
__label__label1 The first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. They are ages 0 and 0. I can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. They live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. I feel bad saying this, but it is true. She is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. When I used to live with her I took advantage of this. I made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and I did not take care of myself. Thank God I got out of that situation. I moved in with my father and my former stepmother. They got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them I would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. Even after my dad and stepmom got divorced I still lived with her, I am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. Getting back to my sisters, I am afraid that they will fall into the same habits I did and they are not as lucky as I was to have my stepmom. I can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. I hope that I can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because I only get to see them about once a month. They are beautiful children with great personalities. Unfortunately PROPNAME the 0 year old has already had troubles in school. I know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. Andrea the 0 year old is absolutely brilliant, I don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern I did of lying and not doing her school work. I would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because I am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. I cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. I know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and I love my mother very much also, but I just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. It would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. Overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that. 
__label__label0 I'm supposed to be writing from my stream of consciousness. I guess I'll find out how random my thinking is, as if I didn't already know. I really like this CD too bad this is his only one. I wonder what CD I should listen to next. I should try to call PROPNAME again. I really want her to come visit me up her. I know how much she likes LOCNAME. I'm really glad that I didn't buy those tickets for the ORGNAME ORGNAME since now I have a math test that night. I wonder when the concert starts. I really do want to go. And the concert is the day after my birthday, it would be a present to myself. Plus, I've been waiting 0 years for them to play in LOCNAME. I really like this song. This room is rather boring. We definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls. I have to make a list of stuff to pick up when I go home, otherwise I will forget everything and I don't know when I'll be going home again. I think I'll listen to ORGNAME next. I haven't listened to that CD in awhile. I'm glad I decided to bring the CD with me. Today is PROPNAME's birthday, and PROPNAME's. I should send PROPNAME a card. I wonder if PROPNAME got the one I sent her. I need to get a prepaid calling card so I can talk to her. She needs to come visit me too. I should probably email her again. This bed is so hard, it's making my back hurt. But I have to admit, it's not quite as hard as the one I had during orientation. You would think the mattress would give some after having so many people sleeping on it. I miss my bed at home. It's so comfy. Wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden. I think that this is one of the coolest assignments I've gotten in a long time, it's much better than all the busy work I had to do last year. My mom will be happy to know that I like my psychology class. I won't be talking about music all the time, I'll actually have something related to my major to tell her. Well I think that's been my 00 minutes of truly intelligent thinking. 
__label__label0 There are mostly worries and fear traveling through my mind at the moment. The college stress has really kicked in now that classes have started and much work is to be done. The work is really bothering me in that the level of it is so high. There are many other factors in my stress including being away from home. In the whole 00 years of my life I have never been away from home without my family for this long amount of time. I guess I just miss all the little things about being at home-the comfort, luxery, friends, family, and not to exlude food!  I have eaten Chinese food most of my life and I can say that the dorm food I do not find to satisfying. And the life of college is so different from my previous school experience. ORGNAME is so big and so diverse that it's kind of difficult to adjust to. Some people are friendly whiles others may not be. Failure is also a concern for me. I have always done well in school and my parents have high expectations for me to succeed here in college. I miss all my friends and always think about the past and all the good times. I guess I must start all over here and make new friends and continue all the good times. After all, college is supposes to be the best time of one's life. I also think about what I will end up after college-where I'll work and who I will hang out with and if I will graduate here in LOCNAME. My past two weeks here in LOCNAME have been decent. I have been doing many different things like shooting pool or just hanging out with friends or going clubbin in 0th ST. Also I have been busy I might add. The people I have met are very similar to me personality wise. And most of them are from my home town of LOCNAME. I have noticed that there are many different groups of poeple here. I guess the homework load is as much as I expected before I started coollege but there are so many activites to attend to that I find it hard to complete all the work. That is when stress kicks in again and I end up just trying to rush through it. The class sizes are amazing larger than I expected them to be although I knew that ORGNAME is the largest school int he nation population wise. I fear that I will not perform as well in school due to all the distractions that goes on like friends wanting to go out and the many places to go to like 0th ST for example. I guess I will adjust to this environment eventually but when I will I am not sure. Rest has also been an issue in my mind as I have trouble sleeping at night when I have early classes the next morning. I am very tired the next day having to walk so much during each school day. But the next night I will find it hard to sleep again. I hope that ends very soon also. 
__label__label1 Hi, I have no idea what I'm going to write but who cares, here goes. I'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of LOCNAME West, across the where I now reside, in Jester LOCNAME, doing a writing assignment for Psychology on what comes in to my mind first. Well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. I've been away from books and studying for 0 0/0 years now, and 0 week into ORGNAME and 0 classes and 00credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that I have to do right now. I've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. Basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. And the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! Damn, now I know why americans are so rich. Nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. Not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now I guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after I complete this assignment, and maybe the next. Thoughts, Ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. Well I'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, I thihnk, I did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??Jerk!  Now, let's get on to sensations. Hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. Sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. Nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. Well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. A result of chatting last night with my roommate till 0am and waking u p this morning at 0. damn, really hate early mornings, I'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. Calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. But what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? Really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 00 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata! 
__label__label1 Okay, I am very frustrated right now. I just tried to complete the pretesting survey and I was unable to get on to the web site. I tried for a long time and it still wouldn't work. Anyway, I have so much work to do and I don't feel like doing any of it. And just thinking that I have my economics class at 0:00AM tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better. I can't wait until my weekend comes. This past weekend was awesome. My friends came up to visit me for the whole weekend and we went out and stuff. My boyfriend, who I haven't seen in about a month, also came up with one of my best friends on Sat. I was really happy. Gosh!!! I am really uncomfortable in this chair at this desk. I have to put the keyboard in my lap because we don't have anywhere to put it. my back is hurting. my roomate looks like she's really comfortable in her bed while I'm here all twisted in my chair trying to type. I wonder why I'm having trouble thinking of things . It should be easy to just type whatever comes to my head, but, it's like my mind is not all here. I can't believe that I almost lst my key today. I got home after being gone to two cclasses and I realize that my key is gone. I don't have fifty dollars to just throw away. I wish I was kind of rich. no, not rich just better off than I am right now. I would just like to live comfortably. with just a little extra cash in my pocket. ouch ! my back is really bothering me right now. maybe after I finish this I should go and check if I can get on that pretesting thing again. waht is I keep haveing trouble with it?  and, what if I never get it to work?  then what?  well, maybe I can go to somebody elses computer to do it. I wonder if it's the computer that is not working. I don;t know . but then again, I'm also computer illiterate. I can't bele\ieve that 00 minutes have not gone by yet. ohhh, I;m so tired. I still have to do more homework and I'm sleepy. I'm also getting kind of lazy to go work out, but, I have to go because I missed this whole past weekend. I feel like I'm getting fat even though I eat salads and baked potatoes   every day. the jester food is gross. ooh, that late night food last night was so gross. It was extremely greasy. eating that stuff on a regular basis can make you really fat in no time. I hope I don't gaing those freshman fifteen . that would suck. I don't' want to gain any weight at all. I've seen too many peaple come home really fat after just a few months of coolleege. I'm really tired of typing already and I really want to stapo. I can't even spell anymore. I really hate thursdays. I have too much stuff to do on thursdays. my day is ruined at 0:00 when I have to go to economics . from then on it's jsut hell. then biology is really long. it's not a bad class it's just really loong. 
__label__label1 We went to LOCNAME LOCNAME today as a sorority, and met a bunch of my new pledge sisters. I just pledged PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I absolutely love it. Today, we layed out beside the pool, which really has lake water in it,and I nearly fell asleep. When I put my feet in the water, it felt like I had just breaken through the top layer of Ice, and now my feet are in the water below it, like a pond that had been frozen over. It was really neat to see the different type of people that will soon become some of my best friends. Hopefully I will have gotten a tan. Yesterday, I went to the football game and met my boyfriend and his family there. He lives in LOCNAME and is a senior in high school. His brother is one of the starters on  the football team, so it was really neat to see him play. I sat with my boyfriend and his family, which I hadnt seen in a while. Later on that night we went to his brother's apartment and hung out. I was so happy to have seen my boyfriend. He's an incredible guy. Anyways, I could go on forever. My feet really hurt today from these little pieces of wood that were on the ground, and when I walked around with no shoes, it did not feel good. Right now, I am looking around my room and it looks so much different than it did a week ago, when I had not yet pledged a sorority. Everything I have now is zeta stuff. It really is kind of neat. I love being in a sorority. It's really a good chance to meet people and feel a sense of family even when you are away from family. Speaking of family, I really miss my family. My parents are divorced, and my dad lives in LOCNAME. My mom lives in LOCNAME with my two younger brothers. They miss me so much. Especially my dog, who uses the bathroom all over the house just to show us when he is mad or upset with us. My mom said that lately he has been doing that. I guess its because I left him. I always would play with him, such as throwing a frisbee and play tug-o-war. He was so attached to me it was unbelievable. Everywhere that I went in the house, he would follow. I love dogs. I can't wait to go home and see all of them. My brothers really miss me also. They don't have an older sister to boss them around anymore. My mom really misses me too. I was the only daughter, so she was very attached to me. She calls me about 0 times a day, and emails about 0. I guess as time passes by, she will get used to me being gone, but right now I don't think that she has adjusted very well. But I guess that goes for all moms when their children go off to college. And its kind of funny because I was really scared to come here. I have heard its just so big, and the sororities were so cruel. I was frightened. I had always wanted to go to ORGNAME, because I am definitely the more conservative type, but I have amazed myself in that I absolutely love it here. LOCNAME is such a neat town, and there is always something to do. In LOCNAME, we had to sit and figure out something to do on a Friday night. Most of the time, we never came up with anything. Here in LOCNAME, there is not one night where nothing is going on. There's a ton of good restaurants and fun places to go to. Especially LOCNAME LOCNAME, it was a great place to go for a picnic on a Sunday afternoon. I have family down here in Austin, so it is neat to have a place to go. I feel much more secure. They are about 00 minutes away, which is perfect, because they are not too close, but they are close enough for me to drive over to whenever I get sick of the campus. My cousin, who just got back from a mission trip in the LOCNAME, will be living at my aunt and uncles house next year while she is working at a church. It will be neat to finally be living in the same city as her. I have always seen her on trips and family stuff, but never have I actually been in the same place with here for more than a week. So I am really looking forward to the friendship and bond that we will be making this next year. I am hoping that my year goes good and that I can keep up with all of my classes. I am planning on going to all of them, and trying not to miss them. I also really want to keep up with the reading and stuff, so I wont be as stressed out at exam time. I am looking forward to this next year, but I know it will be a hard adjustment and a huge challenge, but I know that if I work hard and put my mind into everything, I will do great. 
__label__label1 I have too much to do today. I should go work out. I need to learn to prioritize. Its unbelievable I have met or at least introduced myself to since I hae lived here, I need to work at remembering names. I like my classes so far, all in their own way. Calculus is the weirdest because I don't remeber much at all clearly from high school yet I kinda like bein confused like that. I wonder how all of my friends are doing form high school?  I hear that the football team is using more of a passing game and I wish I was there for it all. I need to call my friend PROPNAME, I can't wait to go visit him at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I've been writing for fie minutes now, its going to be a while. I need to go get I computer, I am tred of always waiting in line or bumming other peoples'. I'm gettin pretty good at spinning the pen on my finger, its kinda embarrassing if I do it in class and I miss. I wonder if my dad is going to get the new car or not. I would loe the chance to drive it. I would race cars if I could but I would be entering the field kinda late and I don't even know where to start. I wish I hd the time and money to take driing lessons this summer, then I could at least go to driev on a track if I had the car. Theer are too many things I want to do when I grow up. I like to be able to do everything, but I also want to marry the perfect girl and have the best kids and spend all of my time with them. I'e been writing for ten minutes now, I'm getting closer. My hand is starting to get kinda tired, I have multiple thoughts at the same time and I can't keep up with them all at the same time for this paper. I need to do my laundry, htose sheets I hae are still kinda stiff. I wish I had'nt slept so late today, I wasted half of my day and I missed a class too, it was probably the only time the teacher has gien a pop quiz. I want more cool signs, I think my walls are so bare, I want to have a room I enjoy being in. I get kinda lonely here by myself sometimes, but I think I am glad that my roommate never showed up. It gies me a lot more freedom. I can't wait for this weekend, hopefully I can get enough peopel together to go cliff diing. That guy in the hall is gettin on my nerves, he worries too much about stuff, the prob is I kinda see the way I used to be in him, and wonder why I eer had friends. so far college is a blast though, I'e got all of my old friends that go here, plus all of the people that I have met, so I always have something to do, but thats the problem because sometimes I don't get stuff I should get done finished. It's kinda my fault too though, I think I kinda aoid doing homework and such. I want to go see a movie sometime, its been a while since I'e seen one in a theater, I need to find a cool girl to go with. I really don't have and good thoughts now, being interrupted is kind of a hassle. There are lots of people I need to call, I should do it soon, many people I enjoy spending time with and I havent seen in a while. I have two dictionaries up there that I havent even used, I feel kinda bad but I havent had any need for them yet, n/m, I am supposed to look up some words for that seminar class. Oh well, I'm finally done, but I htink this is kinda cool, it takes  a while to get into, but once I was started I think it was fun. 
__label__label0 WEll right now I'm doubting I can write for the next 00 minutes straight. I don't think I have that much material, that's worth putting down anyway. Id rather be doing something else for the next 00 minutes. I'm looking forward to going out tonight. There is a party and it should be a lot of fun. I'm going to get drunk and that will be fun. Class this week was interesting, however I worry that I am falling behind in a couple of my classes. There's so much reading and such little time. I'm pledging Delt and that keeps me really busy. That's who the party is with tonight, my pledge class. They are pretty cool guys. These guys keep walking in here and interupting my writing. That is annoying. I had this girlfriend named PROPNAME. We broke up before we came to school. I think about her a lot now. I guess I miss her. I hope she is doing well. i am still thinking about her. I need to go help a couple of my friends sneak liquor up into Towers. My time is just about up anyway. This really wasn't that bad of an assignment. I had fun. See you in class. 
__label__label1 Free asscia-association. My friend and I have a game that we play on instant messenger with free association. it's fun. My nose is cold, this dorm is always cold except for that one time- where it was hot after I had walked in from already being hot in this hellish austin climate. I'm listening to john coltrane. my friend bought me this cd. it's really hard to not press backspace when I misspell a word. um. i like the music I'm listening to but it's kind of a bad recording. a girl down the haa, syd and I were taling about britney spears the pop singer tonight. I was concerned about how she's making pre-teen girls want to change thiere bodies since she got a boob job and since seh she's an pop idol- it's okay to get one or something. I was never happy with my size when I was little, but I just don't think that she should have gotten one. it's not that important. um,. 00 minutes>? I have all of 00 more to go. I'll stop at 0:00. I went to my first frat party last night. that was a trip and a half. there were several people from my high school and one girl from my ex-boy's college(baylor) and I don't like her much, becuase I don't know what kind of relationship they had. that boy. jesus christ. that bastard. well, it's okay I talktd to him f on the phone for a while today for the rfirst time in -well, since I got here. we erewere really close over the summer. he was smoking pot when I called. I called becuase last night after the party I came home an dwhen I checked my email, I recieved amn emial fronmm some guy named richard _will I print this out?- he has a n address similar rto my ex's an di've been sending emial to the wrong guy. so I emailed him back event though I didn't knowhim and explained to him what had happened. then I got a respncse today from him and I mailed m him again. I relly like my computer. I t upset someone , thoiugh. , I went out with a guy that I met becuase he built my computer, he told me I that he loved me after 0 weel and I (week) got scared. I hate most men now. but that's okay. hating boys is what made the frat party so fun last night. I danced with a boy for about a minute and then dropped him - just like that and walked back to my grlfriends, laughing. ewe walked home last night- right past some cops-we also made friends with the bouncer. he told us a joke to see if we;d been dringing. I thought he was great. well, I son't know what else to say. my fingers are cold my nose itches and my hair is in my face. syd said that someone's talking about you when your nose itches. I always though taht when your necklace was on wrong someone was thinkg og of yu. I have a stuffed animalk. she's the super adventure team mascot. esta eric and adnrew and me. we had so much fun. ruby was the mascot. jojos, photograh, high speed, gun. I meanyt fun, but it came out gun, I haven't been looking at the screen becuase I am not very good at typing like that. I'm starting at my fingers and io know when I mess up, still, but I'm not fixing it. I was a little at the beginning out of habit- ani di franco has a sog called out of habit. "you know, art is why I get up in the morning, but my defif\nition ends there, it soesn't seem fair that I;'m living for something I can't even tdefine,. and there you are right there in the mean time, wekll I don't want to play for you anymore. Show me what you can do. Tell me what are you here fo. I wasnt my own time I wasm my old friens, I want my f\old face, I wasnt my own mind. Fuck this time and place.

I wanted to do this when I had full concentration adn preferably not a roommate bugging me. she went home for the weekwnd. she wasnted me to go with her. she talks in her slepep, and it 's really funny, but I try not to laugh becuase I'll wake her up. I'm worried about my friend breda, I miss her. I worry about PROPNAME and Esta too. I love thenm. I have on e more minute. Maybe I'll have a tic tac when this is all over. I need to go to the ORGNAME tomorrow for art history I need to sugn up for experinments, too. I'm not going to sign that health form, though. I don't know if I want to give access to my health records like that. I have nothing to hide, I'm just not comfortable with it. I have cramps now. an dmy time is up, so bye. 
__label__label1 Hello, well I'm writting my stream of consciuness at a friends room because the  ethernet at my room does not function as of yet. So here I am pondering as to what to say. It angers me that I have not been able to log online at my apapartment yet. i intead to call the ethernet people and ge the situtation rectified but as of yet I have not had ample enough time to properly do that. Well, school is pretty cool so far so I don;t have much to complain about, I just ate lunch and suprisingly the school cafeteria food isn't that bad, in fact it sort of is pretty good, they have nice burgers and I always pile on the tabasco like the bastard I am. Twenty minutes is quite a long time, I bet my response here would be more interresting if I was under the influence of some intoxicating something or other, not that I do that sort of thing, but who really cares right?  I seriously doubt anyone is reading this and if you are then I send out a hearty "hey hey hey". Well hey, anyways,b back to the subject at hand wich is nothing except for the monotomous and endless stream of infinity that flows through my veins like a vapor of the serpent that eats tiny little fleas that impend on the consciouness of the letter better red little ant eater. Oh hey, are you following my consciouness?  Or are you thinking that I have lost my mind in the impending fires of infinity that ingulf the ebb and tide of an ocean tht haas not yet come to grips wit hthe reality that condesends to the vast pits of a sub-world burried in the truths of a mad man who has lost all sense of truth,  pity, and denial, opting aptly for the tools osf self destruction and the endless orgasm of the inevitable ghost. So we can fully understand our prophets. who cares?  who cares about the subtle truths that we seek to uncover in I various means of apathetic lethargy?  perhaps we schould quote some famous scholar and then abolish our reason with the tip of a hat a cigar made from banana leaves?  Where have our morals gone today?  Where is the profanity in a language that adulates the adoration of adulturation and the abominal abortion of the spirit of the infite wisdom burried in the truths of an incoharant lunatic rambling at the sppeed of a jack rabbit copulating wit hthe pourpouse of my reasoning. Well I ponder if it's been twent ymintues yet, and I think that it indeed has so I must depart with a hearty hand shake and in the words of the infinite wisdom of the great and all mighty pooh bear, say ta-ta for now. take it easy and such. where is the party in the silent room?  Indeed if you know won't you please come and joing me. All is ripe for the tacking. So long for now. 
__label__label0 um I have never done this before. I guess I will think about my day today. I  went shopping with  friend. We went to a little store called oat willies it is  kind of a "subculture" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all  kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs  too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then  as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin  robbins to say hi. I don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we  went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable  looking t-shirts. We both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there  accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really  had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the  rack that didn't have a shirt on it so I guess one of his shirts was missing and  I feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. Oh  well no big deal for me I guess. so I bought one t-shirt for three dollars and  we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another  little store that sells interesting odds and ends. Myfriend ended up buying a  bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap. then we went back to  her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room. ok  I think it has been about 00 minutes I hope whoever has to read th 
__label__label1 0:00. 00 minutes. time?   Why did I wait so loong to do this? Well I didnt know about it until Thursday, but still, what happened Friday?  Oh yeah, I slept I think or maybe not it seems so far away. I guess its worth waiting since I got to see PROPNAME. God I sometimes feel like we are in competition and I keep reminding myself that  it can't be like that. Of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. I wonder why I have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since I've been here. PROPNAME I can kind of see because she is older and attractive but I would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. Maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. God I need to loose weight. Why did she think I didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell I had?  Maybe she feels threatened like I do. I bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. I kind of want to skip the greek festivle because I am afraid. I'm afraid of being the odd one out. Ok obviously I willl be like the only non greek. PROPNAME,. how I wish I was greek or smatter sometimes. I miss feeling loved. I miss feeling strong and powerful. Although I do feel that way here sometimes. LOCNAME just isn't right for my balance I think. Then again this is an emotional time of the month. But no I have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. I gues sits good to face, but at the same time I just want to crawl back home to paris. Will I always think of it as home I wonder. God, sometimes the future is hopless. Dear god, why do I sometimes feel this desperate?   I know there are a lot of things I have done wrong, but I also know that I have been forgiven. Lord, I love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which I can get to a church so that I can get the spiritual nourishment I need. I am starting to feel drained/. My father, jesus christ, please help me to help PROPNAME. Help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. Lord I pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. Christ PROPNAME please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. After vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. Please help remind me not to give  up, that mistakes are just that  nad that I neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. Lord Jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because I know I don't have it. Please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. Help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. Lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. Lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. Lord I pray for jUles. my heart is breaking for him because I love him so much. The thought of him tears me apart Lord. I know that everything happens for a reason and that I am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. Lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when I see it and to embrace it willingly as I believe I do now. Lord please continue to work in the life of PROPNAME. Help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. Help him to understand how I know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that I am able to experience any time. Give him peace lord   jesus from whatever may torture his mind. Help PROPNAME and PROPNAME to find the same things too. To be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time?  00:00. 
__label__label1 I'm now worrying about what to write which is really irrelavant because to the instructions. I am at a loss. When the mind watches itself most of it stands still. But when it stops being vigilant it wanders anywhere and everywhere past, and future. Again I can think of nothing when watching the mind think of something which is very ironic. And again it stops and doesn't go anywhere when I try to see where it is. I hope I don't bomb this paper which I'm not sure how its to be graded. I bet my grammer really sucks, if I can use that word "suck"  but I shouldn't worry about my grammar because it doesn't matter according to the instructions yet because of insecurities I still worry about my presentation, any presentation. Now I am talking to my friend and being distracted, but since I reallize it I'm no longer distracted. What else is going through this undeveloped mind of mine, wow, that rhymes, mind and mine, ok, I probably sound really stupid now but am just following instructions. The phone rings, and I think that it may be my mother checking up on me which she already did, but I'm sure would not hesitate to do it again. Room is now quiet with everybody gone, no distractions except for the unknown mind with all of its mysteries. Funny its always with us yet we know next to nothing about it which maybe this class will attempt to shed some light on but I doubt it will do very much good for anyone to decrease thier pains and increase their happiness. Everything in psych. is great but helps no one if it serves no purpose such as increasing the quality of ones life. Philosophy I believe tries to a bit more to do just that but is so abstract and too much of a subject to be studied than to be experienced and learned which doesn't help anyone anyways except to tickle and play with the intellect. Unless a certain form is adapted to the way of living and adopted as the way of thinking will it help those who really seek help. Now I'm a little afraid all that I just wrote is irrelevant to the assignment and will recieve a bad score. Perhaps another manifestation of insecurity. This world today is full of insecurities, fear, though we have everything anyone could want in the LOCNAME, but yet we lack that which cannot be externaly obtained. How ironic that most of us strive in life but never know what we are striving for, what PROPNAME PROPNAME calls personal management but lack of personal leadership, direction. Because we seem to have everything we want but are actually lacking we don't know where to direct our constant thirst for happiness and constant aversion of suffering. But the cause of our pains is ignorance, the lack of wisdom, wisdom - understanding but mostly realizing how things really are. Perhaps to this is to philisophical for the assignment. but as thoughts come into my head I write just like the instruction say. Although I can think of no reason for this assignment excpet to observe the mind, but I can not see anything to learn. yeah, maybe the next assignments are also like this, but probably not, wishful thinking. Almost done, just two more minutes and I maybe will continue the other assignments. Our study hall in our dorm really sucks. Its very creepy looking with all sorts of pipes and wires running through the wall. Uh, oh, girl thoughts, probably not appropriate, I don't even know if I spelled that word correctly. My mama told me that mastery over the mind is the highest form of victory anyone can have. It is said that a man may conquer a thousand people and a thousand lands, but it is far better to conquer himself just once. 
__label__label1 I want money. I like money. What is the easiest way to get it?  Winning the lottery is too hard. Maybe I can get a wish to come true. A wish. Where do wishes come from?  I hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards?  Where would one find a leprechaun?  If I found one, how could I catch it?  It must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. They must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- I wonder if they drink. A drunk leprechaun. Funny,  The life of the party. Granting wishes for everyone. What wish do I want?  What else?  Money, happiness  power?  Power is good. Maybe I could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. I could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe I don't. I just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. Two kids. Maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it  live off interest. That sounds good. I could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. I like sleeping. But the time goes faster when I sleep. Do I want to go faster?  no?   yes?  maybe?  definitely maybe. I don't want to miss anything, but I want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. I'm too lazy to have to work for a living. I don't know how I'm going to get through it. All of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. But I only just started. preparing for my future. The future is a fantastic place. It can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if I know what I'm talking about. People die. kill eachother. Why? to what end?  Everyone dies. What difference does it make when?  I would prefer to die later in my life, though. I guess I want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. In the next millenium. Nostradamus says the world will end. soon. I want to see if it happens. That would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. Not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. Not as it is known, but in some form. A science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. As long as its well after I'm dead, I don't care who has it. The world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. Its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. Media tells us its not coming,  they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us there's no cliff, that were running towards an open pasture full of wildflowers and pretty white bunnies. But I know the cliff is there. Thats something else I want to se before I die, or as I die. Will the world survive?  will man kill the earth first, or will man kill man first?  One way, nothing survives. the other way, the earth survives, and possibly a few men, to carry on the race. I know who I'm rooting for. I want man to get to that cliff and go right off. Unless it can slow down, or run a different direction, but for now, the cliff. But that should be after I'm gone. I don't have to worry about anything. If only I could catch that damn leprechaun. 
__label__label1 Right now I am very tired, and I really don't know why. I got enough sleep yesterday, but then again I had a very busy day yesterday. It must have been when I went to try out for the texas crew team. I am not sure whether I should join, and it has been bugging me all day. If I join, I will have to sacrifice many things. First off, I would have to get up really early in the morning and I am not use to that. Second, time would be another sacrifice. I would have less time to do other things,  and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. I am really missing the girl that I left back home in order to come attend the university. She was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. We got along great, hardly ever fighting. I miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. Her parents were really good to me also. This girl was going through a really hard time in her life when I met her. I am greatful that I was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. That time was when her parents were getting divorced. She got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. This upset her a great deal. I enjoyed the fact that I could be there for her when she needed me. As a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. Her stepsister is really making her life tough. For that, I resent her stepsister. She disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. This girl is named PROPNAME. Emily really pisses me off a great deal. Why does she have to be that way. Nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. I think about my girl quite often, but I know that I am up here for the reason of getting an education. I don't know whether I should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when I am home. But while I am in LOCNAME, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. It seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. At first I was bit scared, but I know I can come out on top if I put the work and time in. It is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. But it can be done. I am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at LOCNAME. I plan to do the best that I can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing I will make it through alright. Wow, it has already been twenty minutes and I've got to make a class. 
__label__label0 This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 0 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the "freshman 00" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have PROPNAME because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of PROPNAME this weekend 
__label__label1 Well all I can think about at the moment is how stressful college is and why we have so much work to do. I don't understand it at all and I am very stressed out at the moment. highschool seemed so much easier but I know that it is something that I need to get used to. on top of it all I have so much sorority things to do. we have so many meetings and assignments to do on top of all of our school work. I just want to sit in my room and sleep because I am not feeling well. also I miss my parents. eventhough they are fifteen minutes away I am missing them but when I get around them they annoy me so bad. I don't understand it. I am difinately looking forward to our weekend because I know that our pledge retreat will be so much fun. especially becauase I cannot wait to get to know my pledge sisters. it will be awesome. I feel disconnected from so many of the girls and I know that they are feeling the same way. we seem to go out with the same people every weekend when there are fifty other girls that we still haven't really gotten the chance to meet. I really miss my friends from home a lot. especially jenna. but I know that she is having a blast at tech with kristi. the dorm is awfully quiet tonight. more so than usual. it is very weird not to hear people running up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs. it's actually very nice. I probably won't be able to sleep because I am so used to the noise. sleep also sounds really nice. I feel like I haven't done it in a year. now that I am sick I know that sleep is very important but who has time for sleep when there is a million other things to do in life. I also need to do laundry sometime in the next century before I run out of socks to wear. I think my mom said she was going to buy me some new socks this weekend but I never saw those. I wish it would just rain so then I would have an excuse to just sleep all day long. sleeping during a storm is so awesome. it feels so comforting. this is really weird just writing about random things. I feel like I am talking into a recorder or something or just having a really weird dream. actually I feel delirious just looking at all of the random thoughts that go through my mind. I feel like it's deep thoughts by jack handy. if you ever evaluate what you think about it funny to think that "we always sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff. "  my dad loves that quote and he also reminds me of it. when I went to the doctor today he was writing down random quotes on the hospital bed paper about college and lecturing me about school. it was really annoying. oh well he was a very old man anyways. he told me never to forget those quotes and of course I already did. what does he expect of a busy girl like me. crazy people. well my time is up. I wish I could type faster so I would have more to say but this is it. random thoughts by PROPNAME PROPNAME. 
__label__label1 Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is "special" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul. 
__label__label1 I am thinking of all the things I have to get done today and how I don't' have anything else to think about. there is so much to get done here and I only got behind one day. dang it this reminds me that I haven't gone to mezes to sign up for anything yet. so I better go get that done tomorrow. RTF reading. shakespeare reading. psych reading. bio reading. art history reading and journal. dang, I guess I could do some of it during dinner, but I told PROPNAME that I'd go with her. I woldn't want to be rude so I guess I'll do it all when I come back. mm, dinner. I'm hungry. wonder what we are having. it better be better than lunch. at least the salad bar was stocked up. I hate it when its not because that is one of the only safe options that there is. Mark comes up to see me on Saturday. I wonder if we'll ever get any alone time. I hope he gets here late because I'll need to sleep during the day because of my pledge retreat on Friday/sat morning. OH I need to call someone about a sleeping bag. shoulld write a note about that, would if I weren't typing all my thoughts out. this is weird. I've never had to do anything like this. wonder if 00 minutes is up, nope 0 minutes. I think a lot in 0 minutes. maybe that is why I talk so much. probably. anyway. I wonder what is on comedy central. I shouldn't turn the tb on because then I won't be thinking anything at all. I'll be all zombie. I'm feeling such frustration now because I really don't want to be doing this and I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I should have done this much earlier when I was feeling okay and had stuff to think about. now all I have to think about it complaining because I don't feel well, don't want to be doing this and I'm hungry and don't want to eat cafeteria food. hey I could order a pizza, but don't really want to spend my money. I should get a job. Wonder if I can fit 00 hrs of work into my schedule. lets see if I worked 0 hrs that's only 0 days of work. no I really don't want to do so much right now. I'll wait till next semester till I have a better idea on what I am doing and how to handle college life. plus I have meetings on 0 days of the week. maybe 0 if I do rha. but teachign dance again woudl be fun. I could contact them and just talk to them. yeah I think I'll do that tomorrow. plus it will keep me in shape. since I'm not taking any dance training right now. about 0 more minutes then I can go eat. I also need to get a haircut. I'll do that tomorrow too. oh and I need to get this printer working. maybe I'll wait till mark comes so I don't screw it up. yeah I think that's what I'll do. only about 0 more whole days till he gets here. I wonder if we are doing the right thing by staying together while at college. It feels right but it sure does hurt when we have to leave. And what is a healthy amount of time to see each other that we won't be intruding?  I don't want ot not see him but I want ot have a life of my own here and its hard to get involved when you are with your boyfriend all the time. maybe I'll drag him to that party on sat. I think he'll have fun. I should really ask first before I make plans. I'm rambling. I always ramble. kerri is done with her psych. I should start mine after I get done with this assignment and the other one. I really hope the other one is easier than this one. if my head wasn't so foggy maybe I wouldn't ramble so much. but then I ramble when I talk too so nevermind. my throat still hurts. I hope that goes away soon. it sucks to be sick when you have so much studying to do not to mention the other things I have to get doen. I should make me a list. I think I'll do that after I eat. k almost done  I hope I didn't make katrina mad when I didn't write back to her. I guess she'll have to just understand that I have way too much to do. oh well. I wonder when it'll get cold. I can't stand this hot weather and its so freezing it the room that I have to wear a long sleeved shirt. but then again maybe its just because I'm sick. wonder if kerri is also cold. oh the 00 minuts is up. food. 
__label__label1 Why is'nt my roomate quieter doesn't he undersatnd that I'm working on a homework assignment, I never really seems to care what I'm doing he just goes on even if it hinders what I'm doing he pushes an awful lot too. I don't know if I can handle another semester with him, I wish I wasn't as nice and well behaved and just told him bluntly and straight to his face that he was bothering me, I miss my girlfriend she's the only one that seems to understand how I feel even though she claims she has a hard time reading me she always seem to know the right things to say and do to cheer me up even in the worst of moods,, why do the simplest things that my roommate do bother me so much, I wish he would just understand that I want to try to go to bed at a decent time even when he isn't tired he doesn't have to go to bed just respect the fact that I'm tired and need some quiet my girl friend always knows when to leave me alone and let me have my space. why do major things that are poletial problems not bother me such as the possibility of failing a test or a bank possibly screwing me over, a bank can take in thousands of dollars a day but have the indecentcy to charge $0 for a money order in a bank that I'm a member to even the employees think it's outragious, twenty miutes doesn't usually seem like a long ammount of time but when your continuously writing for that time period it seems much longer. homework seems a lot worse then it is I don't mind homework when I'm actually doing it it just when I start it off but more when I stop and come back to it after have a good time. i wish I were stronger than I am socially, if I were more out going but then I wouldn't be who I am now and my friends wouldn't be who they are and I wouldn't have my girl friend who seem to be the center point of me retaining any strength and going on.             
__label__label0 stream of consciousness. we studied about that in junior english. what am I thinking. mowed the lawn. hot sun. sweating. boyfriend says I don't have enough time for him. parents say I spend too much time with him and goofing off . i haven't had time to do anything but work and go to school. i have to work today at 0:00 till close. this is fun I like this assignment. parents are eating lunch. they are always on my back about something or another it seems. they make me so mad . I can't wait to get out of here and get my own place and have my own rules, clean house when I want to and not when they tell me to. i love them but I need freedom. why won't they move my curfew up, why do I even have a curfew. I am 00 years old and I should be able to stay out later than 00:00. i love billy so much. it tears me up that we fight so much. walking on campus. gees yesterday was a bad day. every thing went wrong. i have to host three parties today at work. i wonder what packages they are. billy has my license. I need to get it back today. i wonder where they came up with that name. I wish I could be a famous singer. then I wouldn't have to work so hard at getting money and a decent job. I hate rita. what gives her the right to say that we have sucky cashiers. like she is any better herself. she can't keep employees and not many people like her. she is so rude. i wonder if it is true about her husband. that is sad that her stepson thinks she is his real mom. I can't believe they haven't told him yet . he is what almost about 00 or so. 0mins left. i wonder what our next poject in here is. it says on the syllabus. when I am done I will look. i hope it is fun and not borring and hard to understand like my mythology teacher and english assignments. time is almost up then I will call billy back and take a shower and go to work.    
__label__label1 I don't know how to put my thoughts into words. my mind wonders all the time. I'm really tired. the dog is taking a nap -- I wish I was taking a nap, too. I stayed up too late last night. church was hot and not very interesting. I wonder what time we're leaving today. the houston comets are playing very good. I guess they are still mourning the loss of PROPNAME PROPNAME. her death was so sad. where did that crazy dog go now. I bet she went to take a nap in my bed. my typing probably distrubed her. crap! the comets can't score to save their life. good shot. who the heck is that girl. PROPNAME PROPNAME is incredibly fast. I wonder why she doesn't get a long with cynthia cooper. pass the ball. rebound. is that a play or what. my sister is being such a baby today. she is so bossy, and when she doesn't get her way, she throws a fit. I never stick up for my brother, but the one time I do, it infuriates her. I can't wait to get back to austin, and I'll stay on my side of town, and she can stay on her side. I won't call her for a couple of days, so she can get completely over her temper tantrum. I hope eryn doesn't call me for a few days. I just want to stay at my dorm and relax and study by myself. this is the stupidest commercial. I hate that PROPNAME PROPNAME character. I have to go to the bathroom, but I still have 00 minutes to type. I have got to go on a diet. I'm getting extremely fat. I wonder when that aerobics program gets started. I hope it won't be too hard. I have got to set the vcr to tape my soaps for the week. I hate missing those shows. that girl is such a weiner. she is always getting hurt. I'm getting sick of typing. oh that was a cheap foul. I wonder how they wash there hair when it's in those braids. I bet it stinks. that girl is ugly. he is a horrible dresser. I wonder how much money they make. my watch is rubbing my hand. my eyes are tired. I haven't seen this commercial before. it's kind of dumb. my mind is starting to take a nap. it isn't wondering so much anymore. I hate that when I get in a daze and just stare at people. it's embarrassing. this game is getting boring, I wonder if there are any other games on. when do the cowboys play today. how much more room do I have. I guess I get as much room as I want. cynthia cooper is cocky. why do they wear lipstick when they play. that is retarded. they dress up to get sweaty and work out. I wonder how loud it is in that arena. my head itches. I think someone is driving up to my house. that's a walk! the comets are looking better. is it supposed to rain today. it's pretty cloudy out there. my throat hurts. I wonder if I'm getting sick. man I'm tired. can I ever run out of water in my eyes. every time I yawn my eyes fill completely, and --- the phone is ringing --- I looked at the caller id, but I don't want to talk to that person. I still have to go to the bathroom. well it's been 00 minutes, so I'm going to quit. I hope I did this right.      
__label__label1 I have a lot of stuff to do tonight. I'm glad I'm getting this done relatively early. I wont have to worry about it when it comes time to turn it in. I usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but I have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought I'd go ahead and do it. I found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that I'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. I haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. I really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and I hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. I talked to rachel tonight. I know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. I love them like my own family and I know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and I'm already tired of typing. I'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. I miss her. I'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. I'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. I feel a lot more happy when I talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. I still think she is one of the finest girls I have ever met. I just got a new email but I can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. I have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. I like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. I wish I could send one out to someone special. I'm sure she's out there; I just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. I have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but I can do without untill the right one comes along. I'm so excited about going to vail for new year's. we're going to have so much fun. I'm glad kim is going. she is so cool and my best friend in the world. kelly is such a good cook. so is mom. those were both very random. I'm not sure where I want move next year. I pretty much have any option open since brannon lives in some of the most expensive appartments in the city. I only have five minutes left. this is a cool assignment. I like to just sit down and write my feelings for a while sometimes. it helps t osoothe my nerves. I really wish I could check my mail. I have a lot of readiign to do. I love this stuff we're talking about in psycology. I'm not just trying to suck up or anything because I figure dr. penn wont even read this. it is all just really intriguing to me and I am haveing so much fun. I hope meme and bonnie are both alright. I want to see the ellenburgs again. I hope they come out and see us soon. I want to see rachel again, too. and reagan. 
__label__label0 right now my mind says why the hell do I have to do this. I'm not up to doing this crap because I just woke up and I realized that I have to get this homework done before it is due in class. I have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl I love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and I don't appreciate that. anyway I have realized that I have been slacking off in my classes and I have to get started on doing all of my homework because if I don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and I am going to be here all alone. I think that at he is stupid for what he did and I hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to  drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose,  then I will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is  all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, I am also thinking about this girl named felicia that I met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that I have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. I don't think that she thinks much about me but I sure do  hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy I am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food  at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is  not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so I we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out. 
__label__label0 The way I feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. I have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. To be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. Currently I feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. I live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. The people at Jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than I. I don't believe I am as happy about being in college for this reason. I love meeting new people. I find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends I left behind. I seem to dwell on the past lately. I go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. I work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. I many times dwell onthe question "Why do I not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. "  I guess part of the reason I feel this way is simply because as a child I was teased about being overweight. I guess I developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. I've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. It is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. Personally I tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. I also worry excessively about my grades. I guess from reading what I wrote my biggest feeling/emotion is lonliness. 
__label__label0 I think college is going to be the best part of my life. Coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where I'd fit in. LOCNAME has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that I think, I will have no problem finding someone like me. Of course, right now, I'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. I really want to join a soroity and become active in as many Hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. Maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. Even though I only know a couple of people on campus, I feel more comfortable there than I ever did in high school.          Outside of school, things are good at home. I have all the love and support than I can ever ask for from my family. Without them I don't know where I'd be. I love them very much. I don't know why I can't tell them that. I guess I'm just too stubborn. I also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. Even though I didn't really want a boyfriend, I'm glad he's there. He brings a lot of fun to my life. I hope school doesn't take away my time for him. I know its going to though, ecspecially if I join all the organizations that I want.            Overall,I'm satisfied with everything. I know its going to be a long and hard four years, but I'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.           
__label__label1 I don't know how to start a paper like this but I'll do my best. I really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all I miss my boyfriend PROPNAME. He means so much to me and I feel as if our relationship is falling apart because I live a 000 miles away. I don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. I meet a lot of people but I still always think of him. He is so understanding too. He said he would understand if I wanted to date other guys. But to be honest with you, I don't. I know I am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. I cry every night because I miss him so much. I'm tired of crying and feeling scared. I want PROPNAME to be here with me but that is impossible. I went home this past weekend and I realized how much I loved it. I never wanted to come back to LOCNAME. I hate it here. Nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. I wish I could go back home but I can't. I would transfer somewhere closer but I am in one of the top business schools and if I get out then I might never get back in. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, I am just so homesick. I guess in time though it will get better. Everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. It is such a big adjustment to make. I just hope I will adjust. What if I never do?  Then what happens?  Am I to be unhappy forever?  That is how I feel right now. That I will never be happy again as long as I am here and PROPNAME is down there. Maybe I will feel like that for 0 more years, maybe I won't. One can never know. Sometimes I write poetry to ease my mind. I find that it really helps me express my feelings. Whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that I could take?  I think I would really like that. I also want to  learn how to play the piano. Then PROPNAME could play the guitar and I could play the piano. That would be interesting. I wish Christmas holidays would come so I could go home for an extended period of time. I never thought that I would miss it this much, but I do. I think I want to live in my hometown when I grow up. It is such a nice town. Everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. And there I won't be alone. I hate being alone. I'm tired of being alone. I have friends here but they can only do so much. It takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. Maybe someday, we can be together again. At least that is what I dream of at night. He is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up! 
__label__label0 well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were "men". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 00 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now. 
__label__label1 o. k. now I have 00 minutes to write whatever I'm thinking. PROPNAME. That's a lot of time and to be honest I can't think of anything to say right now. I'm tired and hungry even though I just ate. Overslept last night so my body is killing me at the moment. Busted my head playing football yesterday and now my head is killing me. Glad I didn't have to get stitches cause that would have been bad considering that would cost a lot plus I don't like stitches. I don't like needles at all for some reason. I want to be a doctor though so that is kind of crazy. How can you be a doctor if you don't like stitches. Well a couple minutes have passed and basically I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. You want me to talk about my feelings huh. I'm tired, miss home, and uncomfortable basically. I feel good right now I guess, I mean I'm not cold or anything or hot. Just sitting here without my shirt in a chair. You told me not to correct my spelling but I missed the r in shirt earlier and spelled shit, and well I don't want to say just sitting here without my shit, so I corrected it. I'm a pretty good typer I guess. I know where all the keys are and everything and I don't make too many mistakes. I'm using ORGNAME and one of my friends keeps instant messaging me and well I can't reply back cause I have to get this done. I keep putting this assignment off, because I'm with this fraternity phi-psi and well it takes up a lot of my time and I really don't have much time to get on the computer and do this. I could easily have done it on paper cause we have to be at the house for 0 hours everyday for study hours. The thing is we don't have computers there and we are supposed to be in this room doing our homework, and well hard to do this assignment when you don't have a computer handy. It says to do it in seperate days, but I just finally remembered to do this. Actually I knew yesterday but the whole day I was at the frat house doing chores to get ready for the big party. I then went to the big party and had a good time. I know you're probably thinking, if you have time to go to the party then you had time to do this. My answer is true very true, but when you spend 0 hours getting ready for a party you want to enjoy it you know what I mean. I'm really tired of doing this. 00 minutes is a long time and there are some football games going and I want to watch them and well if I do then I won't be able to type cause my mind would be somewhere else. I cleaned my room the other day and so it looks pretty nice. My roomates side is really bad, but mine looks good so that's all that matters. I'm with the phi-psi fraternity and he's with the ORGNAMEs and well they are the biggest rival fraternities on campus. Don't really know much about it, except for the fact they hate each other. All I know is that phi-psi put a sign up in front of the ORGNAME house that said something like you can't spell faggot without ATO. That was pretty creative in my opinion so I give them credit for that. PROPNAME. nothing much to say, and still have a couple more minutes to ramble and ramble. I'll sing some songs, that'll pass the time. Under the bridge downtown I used to something something, o. k. so I don't know that one. It must be your skin cause I'm sinking in, it must be your feel cause I cannot feel, it must be your . O. k. don't know that one either. I remember when we used to sit in the county yard of brooklyn. Good times we had oh good times we lost a long the way a  you aya ay. No woman no cry. No woman no cry. Say say. Hey little sister, don't shed no tear. That's all I know about that one. I'm sure I know a song completely just can't think of any right now. Really don't listen to the words anyway. Always pay attention to the beat, cause I play guitar and I like to play and listen to the instruments rather than the words. I don't know just do. Time is winding down. To be honest I forgot when I started. I think it was 0:00 and well it is now 0:00 so it is almost time. Really want to watch the cowboy game, cause it's going on right now. Jeopardy themes song. Do do do do   do do do   do do do do  do do do do do do  do do do do do do do   do do do do do do   do   do do. O. k. that was a waste of time. I wonder if you actually time this. like if it is a test to see who really finishes this crazy test. 00 minutes is a long time, and well I'm as impatient as someone who really has to pee and is waiting on a stall. I like using analogies, makes things more interesting. Well I'm down to my final minute I think. If you are timing this than I tried to do the whole time, but I'm sick of being here. I'll give it another minute or two. Hummmm. That is all I'm thinking right now. LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME It's that off to work we go song. We whistle that when we do work at the fraternity. It's kind of funny I guess. O. k. I gave it another minute and well peace I'm out of here. Actually I'll be right back cause I have to do the other assignment now.

__label__label1 I was writing a previous paragraph when this computer accident submitted my paper. I was not finished as you probably might have seen. I will continue from here on. As I sit here and try to do this assignment, many things come to my mind. One is all my homework assignments that are due for my other classes. I have spent all day doing chapter readings for other classes and now, though still behind in some classes, feel a little better that I actually made myself read for those classes. At this particular moment I feel very hungry for I have only eaten once today and it was at 0:00pm. It is currently 0:00pm. I do not know how long this paper has to be but when asked to write my thoughts down as soon as they come into my head, my mind goes blank and remains blank for a while. My mind is still held up on the homework assignments that are due for tomorrow. It's been 00 minutes into this assignment so I'm glad I only have to do this for 00 more minutes. Yesterday's lecture just came into mind. I love neurology so I thought it was the best lecture I have heard in a while. There's something about the brain that makes me want to make that field my career. It is a mysterious organ that we are just starting to unravel. I thinks its the challenge that we face in trying to fully understand it that makes me want to become a neurologist. Well surprisingly its been 00 minutes already and I have lots more work to do.

__label__label1 Well, I'm at ORGNAME now, and boy, is it a different life. Everything is different now; no more mom's home cooked meals and I have to do my laundry now. I'm going to go back every two weeks and take my laundry home. I will only need two weeks' worth of clothes and then I can take it all home and get them washed. One main thing I like about LOCNAME are women! Wow, there are some sexy women here. Then again, there are also the ugly girls. They will always be around, but at UT, the ratio of hot to ugly girls is much better than what I have seen before; at least that's what it seems like. I guess women are the motivation to stay here in school. I could never go to an allboys school. I would go crazy! There would be nothing to look forward to. Talking about women, I went back home last weekend and I met my very good friend, PROPNAME. We have been friends for years, but only recently have we gotten really good friends. For example, she took me out for dinner and a movie before I had to leave for college, and she has been telling me how much she will miss me. I think ever since I broke up with my old girlfriend, PROPNAME has gotten closer to me. I am definitely happy about it. She is the sweetest girl I know, and she looks great too. I've been emailing her quite often and I plan to visit her every time I go home. College relationships can be hard when the person you like lives far away. The main reason my relationship with my last girlfriend ended was because of college. She mainly did not want to go through a longdistance relationship, and I agree with her. However, I have known PROPNAME for way too long, and there is no way that I can simply ignore her. Well, I'm not sure what to talk about now. I'm in my room and I really do not want to do this psychology assignment. My friend just called me and he asked me to play a computer game with him. I really want to play, but I still have to type what is on my mind. I am going to talk some more about PROPNAME. I guess, she is the main thing that is on my mind. I cannot stop thinking about her. Her high school homecoming is coming up this October, and I think I will tell her that she can go with me if she has no one else in mind. After all, we went together last year. I am pretty sure that she knows that I have a crush on her. Especially since I gave her a kiss on the cheek two nights ago. I was surprised when she asked me to come over and watch a movie with her. She looked terrific that night; I'm pretty sure she wanted to look good for me. Either way, we had a good time and I made her laugh several times. I think it is really important to keep a girl happy in order to have a healthy relationship. 
__label__label0 This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor PROPNAME was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, "How the hell am I going to get home now?". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, "It's lovely weather we are having today", kind of person.

__label__label0 why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of "natural" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a "serious" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. 
__label__label0 Right now I feel like there must be something more important that I could be doing. That's not to say that what I'm doing right now is unimportant, but I feel that there is something more imperative looming. I feel like I need to clean my room because all of my clutter is getting annoying to look at. I feel like I brought to many things with me to college in order to ensure my comfort, but all these things are only making me more uncomfortable by their presence. Tomorrow I have a test in chemistry that I think is going to be really easy. Hopefully it turns out as easy as I think it will. I don't really need any surprises right now. I wonder if the medication I'm taking for my earache is giving me all these rashes or if it's just the less than par level of cleanliness in the mighty LOCNAME LOCNAME. I heard that it's dirtier than LOCNAME LOCNAME but I'm beyond caring. Rat dander and roach feces don't bother me until I see them. The only thing that really nags me about my dorm room is the bed. Who knows what nasty things that old mattress harbors? If I was really anal retentive I wouldn't be able to sleep on it because of the thought of all the stuff that it has probably accumulated over the years, but instead I succumb to fatigue, grimace in disgust, and lay my head down once again. Speaking of which, my head itches. Rat dander, I tell you. In addition to my concern over the probable existence of rat dander is my concern over the obvious existence of dust. I have never seen quite so much dust. They told us that the air conditioning system wasn't working properly and that they were working on it. It appears to work just fine in regards to spewing dust all over my precious things that annoy me so much. I guess I'll just have to buy some eye drops to go along with the calamine lotion for all these rashes I've been getting. I got the last bottle at Jester store. It was sitting there sort of lonely like it didn't belong at all so I just grabbed it up. I scoff at the poor soul who doesn't develop rashes until a few days from now for he will be forced to go elsewhere for calamine. I think my leg rash might be flaring up again. That sucks. I wish I had absolutely nothing that I needed to do right now because then I could just sit in front of the tv watching a movie and scratching my leg. Now that's the life. Too bad I'm bogged down with college and all of this success waiting to happen to sit around and do nothing. And so ends my stream of consciousness as I am much too absorbed in my itchy leg to think any longer. Plus my 00 minutes is up. 
__label__label1 Ok, so I'm not really sure what I should write for twenty minutes because usually when I'm writing something or doing something I'm totally focused on it. So, I don't know if I can be focused on just straight writing for twenty minutes, but I'll give it a try. Right now, I also have the tv on, I like to do two things at once which sometimes is a fault of mine, because I can't fully concentrate on one thing. I don't like this show, I think I'll change the station. Well, it's been three minutes and I'm kind of of at a stopping point. "You're a god and I'm a god. cause you're a god and I am god and I just thought I'd let you go". I don't actually believe that, but right now that music video is on the radio. When I don't have anything else to think about I tend to sing to myself. I really enjoy singing, but I know it's something in which I'm not that talented at. I'm better than average, but I'll never have my own record. I don't know how people just sit and write what ever is going on in their heads, I mean I tend to think a lot, but I find that I don't think about serious deep stuff. I just think about like what I'm going to have for lunch. I hate this song, stupid Nine days and Story of a Girl. I think it's stupid that PROPNAME PROPNAME is coming out with Spanish language Cd. She doesn't even speak Spanish. Just Hispanic because Latino music is really popular she thinks that she can put out a Spanish CD. But I guess the same thing could be said about NSYNC, They aren't even Hispanic. But it's ok, because "This I Promise You" is a really good song. Ummm. just 00 more minutes to go. I want some skittles. I don't like those man's sunglasses. I wonder if this has to grammatically correct and spelling correct. I'm such a bad speller. Is it possible to really not be thinking. Like I was just staring at the tv, but I don't' think I was really thinking. I wasn't concentrating on the tv, but I wasn't thinking of anything else I'm hungry. I wish PROPNAME didn't have a 000 class. I don't care for eating real late, I'd prefer to eat early, but it's ok, because she's my friend. I like the new ORGNAME song, but he makes me mad. I can understand that he doesn't want to be bothered by people, but that is the price for fame. I feel sad for his daughter, because her dad has some much repressed anger and the life he lives is probably hard on her. I mean having her mother go insane and then having her parents divorce at such a young age, she only looks 0 or 0, will be real hard on her. This is a really long song. I wonder what it's like to just be falling, to not be sure if you're going to be alive after the fall. Does it fell free or is this impending fear of life being over. Does your life really flash before your eyes? And what does it feel like when you finally do fall? I think I'm watching too much tv. As of now, I'm listening to another song, but I don't think that I can type the words as fast as I sing them. But the song is Kryptonite bye 0 doors down. Well, I guess that's it. It's been 00 minutes and I think I've run out of things to say/ think. 
__label__label1 I just got back from your class, so I decided that I should start to type this paper. I am very happy with my classes, even though I feel like they are going to be rather difficult this year, especially my Calculus class. I have a hard time understanding what my professor is saying. I end up have to go home and teach myself most of the information. Well that's enough about school. I just thought about my exgirlfriend. I have very strong emotions about her. I know that she was my first love. But I also am so mad at sometimes. We had talked about me going off to college and we knew that it probably would work about, so we decided that we would date other people. From my experience this really does work out. The first girl that I dated after her was a girl from my waiting job in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I decided that I should tell my exgirlfriend, whose name is PROPNAME, about the girl. This was a very big mistake. Genie came to the restaurant where I worked and caused a big scene. But this isn't the only thing that makes me mad. Things are totally different now that we decided to see other people. We don't get along and we can't talk to each other. I think women need to just make up their mind. They all act like want this perfect gentlemen that does everything for them, but when the actually get that they don't know how to treat it. Usually the go to far and try to take advantage of it and then the guy starts to despise the girl. I don't really wish that things were back the way they were, I just wish that we could still get along. I really miss talking to her. She was a person that I could tell everything to and still feel comfortable about doing so. I am lucky though, because I have a sister that I am very close to. She also goes to ORGNAME and she has been a very big help with getting me settled in here in LOCNAME. She only lives a couple of blocks away from me and she is there for me whenever I need anything, as I am for her. This is my freshman year and I am already dreaming that college would be over. It isn't that I don't enjoy Austin or College, it is just that I am tired of school. I wish that there could be a step in your life that you could just skip, but that is impossible. I would love to just be able to be settled in to a good paying job, but since that will never happen I am prepared to work now to enjoy the benefits later. 
__label__label1 I am feeling a little nervous right now. I just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. Normally I wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. I walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. I never found it. Hopefully the fact that I was not in class will go unnoticed. I had a very busy day, and every little thing I do every day I have to think about twice. I can not react on impulse here in college, because if I do I could get into trouble with people I would rather not be in trouble with. If I do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. I got my ORGNAME wristband today. I had to get up very early in order to do this. I was tired out from last night as well. I have to get up early again on Thursday in order to get my actual ticket. The OU tickets are thirty five dollars. This is pretty expensive. From what I hear it is worth it though. A lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. We're going to take buses to LOCNAME and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. It sounds like a blast. One of my friends from high school moved to LOCNAME to go to ORGNAME for college. It will be good to see him. One of my other friends went to LOCNAME LOCNAME for college. I respect the guy with all my heart. I don't know how he does what he does. I got to see on Labor Day for the first time in like three months. That was really nice. He does not think that West Point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. The beginning of college has been fun so far. I've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. I enjoy living on my own. I live with three other guys from ORGNAME ORGNAME. They are all really cool. I enjoy private times sometimes too. It is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and I get the whole place to myself. It's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. They spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. It would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. I just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. Well it has been about twenty five minutes now so I am going to check spelling and submit my work. 
__label__label1 I would guess the only thoughts in my head right now are on weather or not I doing the things I should be. Is the sorority right for me? I really don't like my pledge class that much but I like most of the other girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I don't know I'm just so afraid that I've totally missed God's plan for my life. It worries me. What if Pharmacy isn't where I'm supposed to be. I love listening to people's problems and just being there to help them but I don't know what to do with that. Where are my thoughts headed I'm not exactly sure I let my though wonder lots of times and they just kind of go in every direction. Sometimes the end up to will I ever find the guy I'm supposed to marry? I really do wonder that sometimes. He has to be out there somewhere but where? I don't know. I hate watching PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Its really kind of stupid but its not that its stupid its that I want that too. That guy has to be out there somewhere and I just haven't found him yet but I always want a boyfriends it just seems like lots of time I have bad luck finding one. And it seems that everyone here has one all the freaking time. Its annoying I want to find that PROPNAMEtian perfect guy out there for me. Maybe it is Chris but I doubt it. We're just way to different. I don't know. Its crazy being here at college things are so different. I don't know exactly where I'm supposed to be. Hopefully I'll find it soon. I like the things I'm doing but something's wrong. I have doubts anytime I'm not doing them if that what I'm supposed to be doing but then I'm with those people and I have a great time. It's really confusing. I just need to find that close best friends that I haven't quit found yet. And I really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. I think God is putting me there for a purpose but what it is I'm not sure. I just can't wait. I just hope by that time I'll know what it is I'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. Its like I feel sometimes I'm putting on a show. It's weird. I hate that I'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. It makes it really hard to fit in. I just need to find my group but hopefully I have now with joining PROPNAME PROPNAME. It'll be all good. Its weird I think that with all the moving I've done it changes things here because I'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. It's weird. I can't wait though to see some of my old friends. It'll be great fun I miss them lots but then I don't either. I just need to find my new group its what I've been waiting for for a while now and I know that group includes a boyfriend. I guess I'm more ready to find that guy than I wanted to admit. Its not like I'm ready to get married just to find him and start getting to know him better. I just want to find my best friend and that best friend will be the man of my dreams who I will marry and I guess I'm just being impatient to meet him. Very quickly. Because it'll be so neat to find him. I can't wait for tonight because I"LL BE going back to church and that's always fun its my favorite thing to do. It's a good thing. And I don't want to go home this weekend but I know I need to so I'm not to happy about that. Its really weird as I am wiring this I'm seeing more into me of feelings that I've tried to hide but I guess are there more than expected. Its funny I don't know what I'm looking for but I need to find it. I have God and I really want to deepen my relationship with him tremendously. I think I'm on the right path for that. I'll get there soon. I just don't know when. I'm so glad though that I found my church home that makes me feel lots better. Really it does. I just know I have a home now. And my Impulse group is great. I know that will be tons of fun. I just can't wait until Wed when we have it again. I think that will be something I'll look forward to each week because its so much fun. And I think I will get along with my group very well. I really miss my grandma lots. She was like my best friend last semester and I could tell her anything. It was nice and I still can except she doesn't write me long email back. I wish she would it would make it better. But that's ok she's still getting the hang of the Internet. Some day she'll learn how to use it and become a pro. I know she will. I hope there isn't anything really wrong with her leg. That wouldn't be good. I'm sure there's not but you never know and she loves to hide it form everybody which is bad because what if there is something really wrong. IT doesn't do any good to hide it from everybody. She didn't let my grandpa do it so why should we let her do it? Not fair and it won't happen. 
__label__label0 Sometimes I wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. Growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, I guess living in general. What is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. I wonder if that was His plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. In a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. As a follower of the times, my faith in Him has also declined as the years have gone on. Well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. Although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. Whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. As I entered high school, I was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. But I realized that life is only as big as you make it. If you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. But back to my point. I made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as I've moved to the next step in my life. My five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that I knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but I don't think that I realized what I was losing. My best friend with whom I spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. I didn't realize how much I would miss him until he left. When I see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. My girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. I knew leaving her would be most difficult, but I underestimated the pain. I miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. I feel like I don't know her as well as I used to and I wonder if I ever will. The leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. I guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, I don't know. Anyhow, I wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. But for now, I guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive! 
__label__label0 ok its 0000. here I go I feel like I'm the bum in waiting for godot. just write continuously, ha I keep messing up I can't keep up wait her I go there are my typing skills or not I wonder how I should take over the world I keep building up my bases on alpha centauri but the drones keep rioting its always on the bases that were conquered why don't the other leaders realize that drones aren't as efficient as people. if any of the other leaders attacks me I'm going to have more trouble this time because my military is outdated, but hopefully it wont be to them my tech is still ahead but I don't know how far ahead. I guess PROPNAME's leaving about now, she's naive sometimes what's it like at this mixer its where a bunch of frat guys hit on you what a match its when whichever one hit on you successfully tries to get you drunk and take advantage of you I can't believe there's a theme, I thought we grew out of it in high school. I don't like the idea of some of the things she wants to do I don't know if she's naive or if she's pretending I don't think it would be as big a deal if had pledged this semester in some ways I like it but in a lot of others I really don't it surprising to hear blake pledged, I don't know if he wants to be friends,,. ,. friends. I wish had some. I'm getting to know more people like in my study group but everyone here seems to have their own agenda. its harder making friends than I thought I thought more people would be looking to make friends. the guys next door are in a fight I bet its about that time when pot luck people decide if they're going to get along, I don't like my roommate, but at least I already found someone to switch with he's always on my computer when I get home, he jumps up like I wont know that just implies guilt or hell try and explain, its just annoying he's supposed to get one man. I'm not a very fast typist I better get better if I want that secretarial job. I wonder what everybody's doing tonight I wish I had more friends like me. I need to remember to get my shots tomorrow. I'm running out of things to think about all this thinking is making me tired, well there's the answer to your survey, thinking makes you tired and since stressed people get less sleep they're more tired so I must be more stressed right, wrong that's getting an explanation from correlation, you can't do that, see I get this stuff I don't want to have to relearn the brain, I already did that in bio in high school, o wait I ran over the time, I'm done 
__label__label1 I just started college last week. It's hard to believe I am finally here. I have been coming to LOCNAME for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at LOCNAME, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to LOCNAME. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here. 
__label__label1 Right now I have a flood of emotions coming down on me. Maybe I'm just to sensitive. I feel that I close myself up when I'm around my friends. Why I do, I do not know. There are some friends of mine that I can just relax and worry about what they think of me. My other friends, I just do not know. It's not just that, but when I am around a group of certain people, I can not open myself to them. The reason why, is that in the past, when I have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. I am very sensitive to things of that matter. I do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when I do not talk to them. I act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. Things have changed since junior high and high school, but still I have to watch my back. Who knows what they say or think about me. I need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. I think I am a nice person and I am openminded about certain things. I feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then I will be there to listen. Whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. I still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. The reason why is that I do not think it is anybody's business. Well, I do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. We are not perfect. Humans have their little flaws here and there. I will admit to my flaws. There are some that I am embarrassed to admit which means I need to work on them. Speaking about working, I need to work out. I worked out only once this week, and I need to work out more. Over the summer, I worked out almost everyday. Well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. It was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. Even so, I still got my three to six times a week that I wanted to get. My clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. Still, I have some more work to go. It's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. I have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and I have not been as sick as I was in the past. Exercise and a good diet works. It can work miracles, and myself and thousands of people out there are living proofs. I can not afford to get sick right now, especially since school has started. If I was to become sick right now, I would be behind in all of my classes and that would not be fun. That would be bad. Let's hope that I do not go down that road. 
__label__label1 wow! I'm not much on typing for 00 minutes, but I love to write emails to my friends. so I guess that that counts. I miss them so much, they are my friends from camp. I get to see them this weekend, and I cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, I guess that I just need to say something to her, cause I'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, I know that she doesn't. I hope that I can fit everything into my schedule that I need to, cause I have a lot on my "to do list". haha, I'll try! that's all I can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that I thought would be less than it is. I mean, I thought that I was pretty responsible, but I'm guessing that now I'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, I'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. I miss them. but that's ok, cause I have so many new friends down here that I don't know what to think. I've had some dates, but nothing GREAT and way exciting so far. I guess that I'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe God will just bless me w/ some amazing guy while I'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause I have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 0 people just walked in my door. I need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, I do. I wish that I could control how much I eat, well, I guess that if I keep on telling myself that, then I need to take some action. well, self, listen. I hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. I need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. I really like my room, I think that it reflects my personality. I change my thoughts a lot. I expected that when I would write this, that I might just write about one thing, but I keep thinking about a lot of things. I guess that I didn't think about it too much, cause I get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but I like her. haha, weird for a girl, but I love to dance and sing. I think that she's talented. I hope that I don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause I haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates. I love to talk to people, they make me happy. well, yea, I really like to talk to people and get to know them. its so much fun. I feel that I'm rambling about absolutely nothing. I wish that I could see the stars here in LOCNAME. but I love when I get to get away cause that's one of my favorite things to do. maybe I'll get a chance to this weekend when I go to a&m. I love how people tell me that they are praying for me. cause I know that pray works. GOD IS THE DEAL! yea pray makes me happy too. being happy can keep anyone going in life. different things make different people happy. I like to find that out about people. God fills me w/ my joy! I really like typing this cause it makes me think about what I am really about. I feel guilty when I make some smart remarks and then I cussed today. which, I never do. that just makes me feel like a piece of junk. ok, I have to go, byebye. :) 
__label__label1 Just sitting here and I decided that this would be a good time to write my stream of consciousness. I'm usually tired and don't feel like doing anything, but tonight I have this extra kick of energy (maybe it's the LOCNAME LOCNAME). I've got ORGNAME in the background. I swear all I've been hearing about is the Video Music Awards. Well. they'll finally be coming to TV tomorrow night. We had a hall meeting tonight to talk about the Fire Sprinkler Installation, but we didn't go. We decided to go to the one Thursday night, because my roommate was talking to her boyfriend. I always just sit there and listen to her talk. I wish I could talk to my boyfriend! I haven't talked to him for so long. let's see. since Friday night! I swear our relationship is so strange. We hardly ever get the chance to talk or see each other. I get mad at him during this time because I feel like he's not trying to put anything into the relationship, but the minute I start talking to him I forget about all those feelings. I'm just so happy to hear his voice that I don't care about anything else. He's supposed to be coming to LOCNAME this weekend. I bought him a ticket to the 000 XFest. I haven't even bee able to tell him that he has one because he's never home so that I can call him. Oh well! I'm so excited that I get to see him soon. All of a sudden my thinking process stopped. I don't know what to write. This is how I usually feel when I get a writing assignment. My brain just freezes up. I put it off until l the very last minute. I absolutely dread having to take English next semester. I wish that I had tried a little harder on the AP English exam I took my junior year. I scored a 0 the minimum score you can get is a three to test out of it. I remember sitting in the biology lab room, it stunk like formaldehyde frogs. I have no idea why that's where we took our test. It took so long! On the last essay I wrote one sentence and then gave up. I wasn't thinking that scoring a good grade on this test would save from having to take English in college. Blah! Blah! Blah! I can't stop yawning. My eyes are starting to hurt from this bright computer screen. Ok it's 0:00. I can stop now. 
__label__label1 My week is catching up with me so my mind is somewhat numb from all of the information being presented to me. The fun and freedom that as a freshman are all too new to me are affecting my energy level and I am fighting the urge to sleep right now. Although my body is so tired my desire to have fun and go out outweigh the lack of energy. As an extrovert my energy seems to come from other people no matter how tired I think I am. I love the newness of everything and hope that it lingers as long as possible. Sometimes, though I long for the familiarity I have left behind. I almost avoid my photo album of my friends, boyfriend, and family. I miss the love which comes so naturally from them. Its that level which takes so long to reach. Everyone here I know at a shallow level. I constantly wonder who will be my best friends at the end of this year. Who will be the ones I will reach that next level of friendship with? There are so many uncertainties about the future. With my boyfriend and I dating other people, I wonder if the miles between us are going to be a stronger force than our love. Was backing off on the seriousness of our relationship a bad idea? I am having fun but he isn't and I really don't want to lose him. It was his choice, though, to go to the ORGNAME ORGNAME instead of coming to ORGNAME so it's his own fault he doesn't like it. My heart just aches for him though because I hate the thought that he isn't happy. I think that is what love is. It's when you hurt just as much as when the person you care about is hurting. It's when you'd do anything in your power to take away that hurt, putting there feelings in front of your own. Love is so much more complex than that, but I believe this at least part of it. I think that when you know everything about a person, when all of their deep dark secrets are told, and you still are head over heels for the person, that is love. Someone once told me we like because, we love although. I think what I have with PROPNAME is love, so these miles will either make us or break us for good. Either way I just hope we will always be best friends. He knows me better than anybody and I guess that is a big part of the familiarity I miss. 
__label__label0 . It's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. Currently I'm ecstatic because I just found out that my soccer team may be going to ORGNAME ORGNAME and that is where my best friend, PROPNAME PROPNAME is going to school. I miss her SO much! When I think of her I never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that God brought her into my life. With my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend I have ever had. I had so much trust in her, that many times I found myself dependent on her when I needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. I remember a time when I was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how I felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. Immediately after I left I drove two blocks to PROPNAME's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. People say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but I know that the friendship PROPNAME and I have can't get much more intimate than ours. Through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. That's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. Although I miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because I am confident that God has prosperous plans for me at LOCNAME and PROPNAME at LOCNAME. Also this will each me to become completely dependent on PROPNAMEt and His promises and not on fleeting things of this world. I really hope that I will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. Already I find myself not making time to be in the Word, which is the armor I need to remain strong against the enemy. I can relate with PROPNAME who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. But glory be to God who makes me free of guilt through PROPNAME. Why He chose me, I have no idea. My mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny Chris PROPNAME lines or petty worries of the day. Already I am thinking of other assignments I need to complete after this and of how I need to get in touch with certain people. Yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to God, and I have such trouble letting Christ shine out of me when I am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. Lord, please make me a bondservant to serve You daily on this campus or where ever I am and who ever I run into. 
__label__label0 "Today is the first day of the rest of your life" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 0000 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl PROPNAME was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from LOCNAME here, but at least her family's from LOCNAME. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was PROPNAME. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other day about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my "duty" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend PROPNAME comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in LOCNAME. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked PROPNAME for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the ORGNAME last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME does have it right when he said, "We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. " Last night, I learned about some of PROPNAME's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that PROPNAME girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 00 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. "Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. " It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says PROPNAME PROPNAME. I guess we all feel like that sometimes. Well, I guess my 00 minutes is up, but I do like this. Maybe we'll talk again sometime. See you, man. Take care and good luck. 
__label__label0 I completely forgot that I had a discussion group for Philosophy today at 00, so I went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to LOCNAME, one to LOCNAME, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the LOCNAME LOCNAME people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. 
__label__label0 The walk was refreshing. I should do that more often. I am not sure why not many people take advantage of the beauty of nature and fresh air, and the flowers. My mother loves gardening. We always complain that she spends more time on the garden than on her children. It is just me, my brother and my Dad. Ours is a small family. Not like my neighbors. They have six children. Must be very noisy to live in that family. I like peace and quite when I watch TV or study. I do not think there are any good programs on tonight. I have never watched The West Wing or Will and Grace. Both won the Emmy. They are probably not my type. I just like Friends. This summer there were not any good movies also. Summer really ended so fast. I miss my friend, "S". I don't know what it would be like to be at ORGNAME ORGNAME with her. It is a shame she did not get admission at LOCNAME. I would have loved to share a room with her. My suite mate is OK. I had lunch with her but we do not have much in common. She is much younger and is in drama. I am in Natural Sciences. I am not sure how I decided on Pre Med. and maybe Business. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher and my brother told me that it would not make me rich. Money is not everything. Well if I become a doctor, i. e. if I ever pass my ORGNAME. Why is life so difficult. I wish life was easier and we could do what we wanted. Better still I wish we did not have to grow up and worry about having a family or making money. I think it is getting warm. I need to turn on the AC. My room mate must be cold blooded. I need circulating air. It keeps me refreshed and relaxed. I am not sure why my parents moved to LOCNAME from LOCNAME. I love the snow and the cold. "T", my friend in LOCNAME, has not replied to my email and she does not even like Instant messaging. I think it is neat that we can do that. I can make friends easily on the net, but face to face is really hard. Everyone thinks I am shy and they are probably true. I had no idea 00 minutes are so long and you can write so much. When I am doing something enjoyable time flies and now it seems that the clock does not move. I need to change this chair. It is so uncomfortable or maybe I can put a pillow on it. I think I will go for another walk after I am done with this. I wander if there is anything good on TV tonight. That fish I ate in the cafeteria is making me sick. I hate the food they serve. I am glad I am going home this weekend. 
__label__label0 well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 0 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 0 weeks now. it feels like 0 months everything is moving by so slow I miss LOCNAME I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 0 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 00 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 0 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 0 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 0 hours actually now 0 0/0 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in LOCNAME I'm kind of homesick. I miss the simple life I lead when I was in LOCNAME everything has changed things are not so simple anymore I fell as though I'm not as happy here I don't know why though. don't worry. I'm not suicidal or anything I just wish I knew what was bugging me I think. actually I hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends I have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class I think ill have to make friends in there soon I feel stress stress from the world everything I hate it I get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. I have to stay awake. I'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. I need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense I like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 00 minutes 00 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye. 
__label__label1 At this time in my life, my feelings have been tossed around in my mind. My stress level at the moment is much then I think that it has ever been. From what I have heard, the degree ORGNAME difficulty in college is the highest possible. This worries me because I know that I am able of fulfilling my college experience, but the problem for me will be if I am able to apply myself. Application is an important aspect of college, and I really do not know if I will be able to focus as much as I should on my schoolwork. Another thing that has raised my stress level is women. With women, my mind has many feelings. One minute I will want to be with my old girlfriend, and the next I want to be with a new girl. My mind thinks about it consistently. Sometimes in class I find my mind drifting into places that it should not. This is when my brain realizes that I need to be focusing more on school in order to fulfill my dream. The stress in my life eventually comes to raise my anger level, at least that is the way I see it. When I get stressed out, I tend to want to release my anger by playing hockey. I feel that it helps me release my stress and my anger because it is something that will always be there for me, and my mind knows that it will be. Therefore, I tend to play better when I am angered because I become more aggressive. At least this is what I have noticed while playing. Feelings are a strange thing. The stuff above, I wrote about two days ago. Now it seems as if my whole perspective on life has changed. My mind has just switched due to a few events that have probably changed the whole outcome of my life. My mind used to hate all schoolwork what so ever, but now that I have grown physically and mentally, I actually enjoy reading and learning new information. I do not know why it intrigues me, but for some reason it does and I like it. I have recently discovered that I love math and I believe that it is what I would like to do with my life. I am considering strongly of changing majors from business to some field of mathematics. I believe that it would be really interesting to be able to be a professor for a math class or to do something else in life that involves complications in mathematics. The thing is, I am afraid to change my major, because I kind of think that I might regret. Getting into the business school is a hard thing to do at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and many people would consider it a stupid thing to get out of it. But from what I have seen so far in BA000 it does not seem as interesting to me as math. I like math so much because there is pretty much always a way to compute the answer to a problem. Knowing and understanding how and why the fundamentals work is the hardest and most time consuming part of math. But once one understands the fundamentals of math, they are capable of doing any form of math problem similar to the one that they understand. For many people, math is the enemy of all subjects. I personally do not like memorizing history or stupid biology stuff. I believe that is why I like math so much, because it is much easier for me to relate to. In a way, my body almost feels deprived because I have not played hockey in nearly 0 weeks. When I used to play at least 0 times a week. I feel like I am not exercising and that I am becoming unhealthy. This weekend, I will hopefully be able to satisfy this hunger for hockey when I go home. Hockey is most likely my favorite thing to do in life, I believe that it is because of the adrenaline rush and it helps relieve stress. Without it, I think my stress level is higher then normal because the stress is not relieved like it is used to being released. College should be an interesting experience. What is to come I do not really know yet, but I am sure that it will be a very interesting experience. Like my sister said, just make sure that you have as much fun as possible and make as good of grades as possible. 
__label__label0 Today has been pretty easy. That girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least I am out of there. For once, I actually do not have a headache yet. And it's already almost noon. I wish I didn't have to go to work today. It's not that I don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. Most of the people are nice. I wish I didn't have to stand up all the time, though. My back itches. It is really hot in my room. Lately, it has been freezing in here. It is probably because I am sitting right by the window. This assignment is really making me tired. However, I actually got almost 0 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. Maybe that is why I don't have a headache yet. Tonight, though, I need to go to the gym and work out. I have only worked out once since I've been here. I think I am getting out of shape, even though I seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. Oh well, it's not like I'm overweight or anything. I am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. It used to make me sick for the first few days I was here. My neck itches now. I think it is moving! Oh my goodness I can't wait until this weekend. I finally get to go home and eat some normal food. Most of all, I get to see PROPNAME. I miss him so much. I'm not really lonely all the time without him, but I am never really happy like I used to be. But after I see him for a few days and have to leave him again, I am sure I'll be pretty lonely. It makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. Now my head itches. My back hurts. I haven't had a massage since I've been here. That would be so nice. Anyways, I just ate a nasty lunch and I feel kind of nauseous. Yuck. Dinner tonight is Mexican food and I think I'll walk to the union to eat. I am really tired now. This type of writing seems to put me into a trance. I feel like I need to take a nap now. I don't think that is possible though, since I have to be at work in about 00 minutes. At least that is the last thing I have to do today. I don't think I even have any homework. Maybe I'll take a nap after work. Well, actually, I need to call PROPNAME after work. Maybe I'll take a nap after that. The room seems like it has cooled off a lot. Maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. My neck and back are so stiff. I want to lay down so bad but I know that if I do, I'll probably fall asleep. My roommate slept in this morning. That was a good idea. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. This weekend should be so much fun. I get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. I haven't seen my parents in 0 weeks. I know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. I need to email her. I need to email PROPNAME too. I wonder what PROPNAME is up to. Maybe I should call him. I don't think I will because he is probably in class and I really don't want to talk to his roommate. Speaking of roommates, I need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. I have no idea what she is talking about. Oh well. My twenty minutes in finally over. I think I will go lay down. 
__label__label0 It seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and I lack control over when that thought surfaces. I have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, I need money. I can list what I need to do but once I get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. I can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. Well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, I think he's the one I'm going to marry. This relationship is just too good to ignore, so I wonder about him a lot. We have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. I've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and I noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. I still have a better work ethic than he does. But he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. I suppose also, I'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. I am a rather independent person. I don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and I don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but I rather spend a day locked in a 0 X 0 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. Now that is what I call companionship. I haven't had a best friend like him since I was 0. I don't think I would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 0 hours away. Another thing that concerns me is the way I have organized my higher education. I haven't really picked out a major, I'm not even on a reasonable track. I'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what I like to read about but I don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. I like math too, and I want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though I don't plan on majoring in any of those. My major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and English classes, and I absolutely hate English. I wanted to go to UT because I wanted to learn more. I like some of school in that I like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that I would have never thought existed. But the way UT works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. We are learning in order to work. Why can't we learn just to learn. Maybe I will be a social science major. 
__label__label1 It may be tough to come up with an abundance ORGNAME ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed LOCNAME for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at ORGNAME ORGNAME with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. 
__label__label1 It's funny how people allow themselves to be manipulated by words. I was just reading my Philosophy book, and different philosophers were arguing the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. As I read I found myself being manipulated by words. I had to step back and look at things as a whole to determine my own view on situations. I think many people are victims of the society that we have created. We live in a cutthroat world that is very demanding. People feel pressured to please others above themselves. I believe that this can be dangerous. People too often define success by how much money they have, how many cars they have, and what their resume looks like. Many times we try to obtain success at all costs; even at the cost of our own happiness and well being. Students feel pressure from many sources. Many of those sources are our parents. They feel pressure to be a success in their parents eyes no matter what the costs. Even if the costs includes the well being of their self. This is a sad occurrence. We should be encouraged by our parents. Their is a thin line between encouraging and pressuring. We look for that line and do our best to walk as close to it as possible. Its funny how our state of mind changes from time to time. We go from being majorly stressed out to being very calm. PROPNAME believed that we should always surf somewhere in the middle, never getting too high or too low. I think that makes some sense. Every time I get stressed out I have to step back and look at things in perspective. Then I ask myself if this "thing" I'm stress about is really worth it. More times than not it isn't. My question is what is the right way to live. If we never push ourselves we never allow ourselves a chance to grow. If we push ourselves too much we run the risk of becoming depressed. I guess like everything else, it all depends on the circumstances. Some things have a tendency to stick in my head. Movie lines for example. I'm always able to remember with great accuracy. Numbers on the other hand, I don't remember so well. What causes that? Is that a gift or a flaw? I have an identical twin brother and we are total opposites. I remember movie lines and he remembers phone numbers very well. Also, we look nothing alike. Isn't that weird. Every time we meet someone and tell them we're identical twins they never believe us. Maybe the doctor made a mistake and told my mom the wrong thing. Identical twins are cool because we have the same genetic makeup. I guess that takes the individuality away a little, but hey, its just like anything else, we've got to take the good with the bad. 
__label__label0 I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 00. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I hope me three friends from LOCNAME can come visit me. It'll be all of them, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, my mom, and my two sisters. PROPNAME's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. PROPNAME made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with PROPNAME and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 00 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either ORGNAME ORGNAME or the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. PROPNAME is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 0:00. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call PROPNAME by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 0, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like PROPNAME PROPNAME typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. 
__label__label1 Personally I feel really stressed out. I am a freshman at a very big university. I hardly know anybody and I feel very depressed and lonely all by myself. I am really close to my family so it is very hard to be eight hours away from them. I know this is a new experience, but I am just simply not happy here right now. Many people tell me that I'll get used to it, but I wish the process of adjusting could be a lot faster. I feel as if I should just give up this great opportunity to be at a great university and just go back home. I don't want to let anybody down, for example my whole family. The pressure to do good in school and not give up is so intense. I want to do something with my life, but sometimes I just look for the easy way out. I didn't know that adjusting to college life would be so difficult. How am I supposed to keep up with all this work that is assigned to me. My time management and study skills have not kicked in yet. I miss my whole family back at home. All I can do is get stressed out, I need to find a way to just chill out. I'm worried about basically everything I can think of. I don't know if I'm going to pass my classes, can I manage much longer here by myself, and are people going to accept me for who I am. I'm just not ready for such a drastic change as this one. I have hardly any money left, and I have not even found a job yet. I really need some help to figure out what I am going to do. I really don't know what buses to take to get to certain places. I get really frustrated reading all sorts of maps. Many times I feel as if I'm not even smart enough to be at a great university like this one. I think that is what my problem is, I just don't give myself enough credit. My brother tells me to think positive and he believes that I will make it here. I can not wait to go back home and see my whole family again. I wish I could be a Senior with only one year to go. Though that is not the case because I am a freshman, with many more years to go. Then again what else better do I got to do than studying and working. I would simply waste time and my life doing nothing at all. I want to be successful in life and have a good paying job. I know that is the reason I am willing to study and work hard. Knowing that when all this is done a job will be open to me. Hopefully a good paying job to support all my dreams in life. I really do hope I can make it here at LOCNAME. Right now as a freshman I really need all the hope and desire to help me get through this year. Hopefully when this year is over I will be glad because I made it through all my classes. I know study groups would really help me right now. I really dislike reading, but I know I'll have to do a lot of reading as a college student. 
__label__label1 I am pretty proud of myself today, for I got much more accomplished than I thought I would. I figured that after my last class I would just take a nap. But instead, I went to the gym and had a great workout. It's always good to make a plan of everything that you want to do in a day. I always have to do lists. They are so useful, and I feel so organized when I make them. And when I finish everything on one list, I feel so good. It is a great feeling. I haven't been having too many great feelings recently. I'm not sure if I like it here. I don't think I ever will either; that is what bothers me the most. Everyone keeps telling me that it is going to get better, that I'll meet more and more people that I like. I just don't think it's going to happen. I really wish I had gone to ORGNAME, for things would be so much easier. It is a smaller school, near LOCNAME, much closer to my parents. Then I'd be able to see PROPNAME and PROPNAME so much more often. I probably could see them every weekend if I wanted to. My phone bill would definitely be a hell of a lot less. That would be so good, because I don't have enough money. I feel bad asking for more from my parents, but it would just be so much easier. I think I really want to apply for that job at George Women. That is definitely a cool store because it has everything that I love there! Another thing I have noticed about being a college student, is that now I don't care about how I look or dress or anything like that. In high school, it was such a big deal to wear the "right" clothes and things like that. I didn't even mind doing that, and it seemed normal. I just miss my friends so much. I made such great connections with three people in high school, and I miss them so much. I am so jealous of all my friends who are so close to each other. Why do I have to get stuck with going to this huge school? It's not fair that I have to go through so many changes all at the same time. I just wish things were easier. It would make me so much happier. I feel like I have done something awful, that I deserve to feel like crap. I know that if I just keep on going, day by day, then things have to get better. I'm just so used to having so many friends and knowing so many people. I have just gotten thrown into this huge pile of people, and not knowing any of them is just plain weird. I just hope that getting use to this school will be a lot easier and quicker than it seems like it will be. I think that things will become so much better once I get used to this school. I certainly hope so because I just want to be happy. 
__label__label1 The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is an immense feeling of relief. I have just finished the rough draft of my Rhetoric paper. It's due tomorrow and I wasn't sure I could pull it together. It's not up to the standard of writing I like, but that's why it's a rough draft. I find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since I got here. I know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. The first night I was here, I was sitting back listening to my music and reading when I thought about home and everything that had gone on there. I remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. It wasn't homesickness. Something about the song I was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky I am. I've had a great life. My parents were very supportive in whatever I did and still are. My friends were always there for me and I never endured any life tragedies. The truth is that I really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. It just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what I personally considered an ideal life. I really do think I've led an ideal life. Never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. The only thing I consider a life tragedy is the fact that I didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and I fought to hard to get here to not come. I think that I'll love it here. Actually, I already do. Most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. I don't see how. The people around me are great, my classes interest me, and I'm never bored. I don't not miss home, but I'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. As far as I'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. I'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. This weekend I'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which I am finding myself attracted to. The next weekend is another football game. I'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. Marching in front of 00,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. Of course, that's only half the fun. The real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. I'm glancing at my clock and see that I've only got about ten minutes left? How am I going to ramble on for another ten minutes. I write fiction stories for fun, love English, and am a Journalism major. Rambling writing style for me. I wonder why I'm occasionally having trouble continuing. Who knows? Psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. Maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. This is harder than I thought. Maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. When I write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. A plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. Just writing off the top of my head is something new. Well, not new, but usually the ideas I get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and I can plug them into a structure. That's actually how I start a lot of my English papers. Start off the top of my head and find a flow. After that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on. 
__label__label1 I'm starting to write this at six twenty five, It's really cold in this computer lab, I wish they would turn the air conditioner down, do they know how to do that, would they do it if I asked them, probably not, but I wish they would, there sure is a lot of typing noise going on in the room, no one is talking, I am thinking more things that I am actually typing, it is really hard to write everything that I think and I type a lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, I am not thinking of much right now, the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it, he probably won't read it though, and he probably won't really think it is dumb, there are probably students who write dumber ones than me. I am horrible at typing, I am making all kinds of mistakes, I hope I can read this a when I finish it, or else there will be a problem, brrrr It's really cold in here, I sure wish they would make it warmer. My fingers and my feet are freezing, and I'm already bad enough at typing, the cold makes it even harder to type, geeze I'm going to have to do a lot of spell checking after I finish this, I only have about ten minutes of typing left, I just heard someone's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab, I always hear phones ring in here anyways, I wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that, they should turn their phones off, so they don't disrupt other people, even though personally it doesn't bother me if I hear a phone ring but I guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying, gosh I can't spell worth anything, I'm hardly going to be able to read this when I get done, I hope I can decipher it, my feet are freezing, I keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that's the point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated. I wonder if its raining outside, that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere, I wonder why I thought of that, hhhmmm, I saw all the clouds earlier outside, it was really dark and scary looking, I hope it rains a lot more, more than yesterday, it didn't rain enough yesterday, I love when it rains, it's better than the sunshine, I wonder if that means I'm a negative person, it can't though cause I am such a positive and optimistic person, well at least I think of myself as optimistic, I try to be optimistic but sometimes its hard, like last week I was so stressed out with all the band stuff, I'm really glad I quit band cause it was too hard but it was hard deciding to quit too, I wonder if anybody in band misses me, I wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me, I hope some of them did, but I guess that's not a good thing to hope considering I have a boyfriend, I really miss my boyfriend a lot, and I just thought about macaroni and cheese for some weird reason, I wonder why I thought of that, maybe cause both me and my boyfriend like macaroni and cheese, I'm such a horrible typist, this typing is probably the worse I've ever done, I only have a couple of minutes left to go, gosh time really went but fast since I was just typing anything I thought, I wonder if the professor will really read this, he is a really cool professor, I like him a lot, but now if he does read this he's probably going to think I was sucking up to him but that's not true cause I really love psychology, that's a hard word to spell, well its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it's spelled, I remember when I was in the spelling bee in 0th grade, I think it was fourth grade, maybe it was third, I remember my ex best friend who was in my third grade class, I didn't really know her then but now she is really stupid but I don't really want to think about that right now and my twenty minutes is up so I guess I'll stop typing! 
__label__label0 As the past couple of weeks have flown by, I have been stressed about my work load. Like probably most college students I have the urge to wait for the last minute before starting any assignments. So far and usually I am always able to get my work done on time, however if I would only start the assignments a little earlier I would not have as much stress as I do now. Also after recently reading the first chapter of my psychology book I am wondering if the cause of my illness is to due to excessive stress. On Tuesday I started to have a runny nose which later progressed into a sore throat. I usually do not fall victim to illness very easily so I am almost sure that stress is playing a large part in it. At my house in LOCNAME I had gotten use to having my friends and family all within a five minute drive. Now that I have moved to LOCNAME and been separated from home for an extended period of time, I occasionally find it hard to balance my time. With the options of sleep, tv, eating, homework, video games, or just hanging out with my friends, it is hard to make a decision on both what I want to do and what I need to do. On the up side of things I feel like I am slowly becoming accustomed to my new life here in LOCNAME. I have started to develop a study pattern and my urge and will to do work on time and efficiently has increased. Over the fall and spring semester my ultimate goal is to have a high enough grade point average to transfer into the business school. If that transfer is successful it will only give me more motivation to try harder and be a better student. That is certainly the goal of me being a college student to begin with. I am looking forward to continuing my hard work and hope to enjoy the benefits at the end of the year. 
__label__label0 Great! Now I have to do this crap on paper! My stupid com. Heard sound. Sounded like my modem, but it's not on. Stupid itches again. This time all at once. I've been itching a lot lately, but it's probably the weather. Popped my thumb. Popped it again. I tend to do things in pairs. Tingling foot because it was in a strange position. I hope my fingers don't give out. Itchy left ear. It's been only 0 minutes and it's already hurting. I certainly hope I don't get carpel tunnel. Ouch! Itchy nose. head. Eyes doing that weird thing, almost like I've stared too long at one thing. Many little itches. 0 minutes now. Maybe I'm a little conscious of how the time is rolling. But then again, that's probably I have a little over an hour to turn this in and finish pretesting. Should set comp up, even though she keeps dying on me. Hand hurts a little, had to flex it. Mmmmm. Good Snickers bar. It's going to be difficult to write any feelings beyond the physical down. I tend to be in a state of. no state most of the time. 00 minutes left. I hope I can keep. Itchy nose. Feeling in the stomach. Hand still a little achy from all the writing. Wished my comp hadn't crashed, else I'd be done by now. Itchy scalp. I hope I'm doing this right. Figures. Comp restarted again. I guess I should turn it off after it restarts. Don't know why it's been such a pain lately. 00 minutes left. Itch to the side. Stretch fingers. Itchy feeling in left foot due to position. Itch in left ear. Gee, I hope these little itches don't mean anything. (feeling amused) Stretch aching fingers. Getting peanut out of teeth with tongue. Comp restarted. Time to shut her down. Hopefully, shutting down properly will end this mess. Popped thumb. 0 minutes left. Soon. Real soon. Well, physically anyway. It'll probably feel like 00. Turn off comp. I hope I can. Turn off power. I hope I can put all this to the web page before time. Ho. Itchy nose. Inside Eyes water. It's a sneezer! Eh, maybe not. 0 minutes left. Guess I should just trust the timer now. Hope I'm. doing this assignment right. But then again there is no right or wrong way to do it. Speaking of which, what "is" this assignment for? What does it do? Yeah, we write down our thoughts for twenty minutes, but. 0 minutes. Why? What do we learn from this? Or is it for the prof. and the department? Don't see what good it could do either. One minute. The clock will beep soon. Better prep for it, lest my heart jump out of my chest. Heart beat increased a little. Heart jumps! (Timer went off) 
__label__label0 I really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at LOCNAME, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. PROPNAME seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. I guess I will go for a little while, not too long because I have a class at 000 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. Why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? I don't freaking get it. It's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. WHY? Are the powers that be trying to torture me? Well, whatever happens, I will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. I just thought about something, I am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to LOCNAME for Labor Day to visit my auntie PROPNAME, and my Uncle PROPNAME. I wonder how Precious is doing. I hope she still isn't messing with that idiot PROPNAME, like I think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. I mean, I know that I have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but I learned my lesson. I want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when I need it. Is that too much to ask for? Gee, I can go on and on about men, and the experience s that I have had with them, but that is old and I am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that I can be on the dean's list like I want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and I hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that I do this year and my years to come. I know that I am capable of doing it all, but I just want to survive. This city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!  
__label__label1 I'm sitting in a library waiting for my chemistry class to start and I just thought of a comment placed on the psychology bulletin board that referred to how people see light and if it is different from person to person. If you think about it, the only way we have to reference a color is by what we have been taught what it is. If I see green for what you see as red, how would we know the difference? This desk is sure filled with a lot of profanities, but not as much as the bathroom on my floor of Jester West. Oh, isn't it fun to live in a dorm, my roommate never sleeps, does homework, but he does eat, all the time, including my food from the fridge. The best part of the dorm was getting kicked out at 0 AM so they could install a fire sprinkler system, this building is a lot older than me, why did they wait this long to put in sprinkler systems? Did they do some sort of statistical analysis to determine it is about time for a fire, that it pretty scary. Wow, I've only been typing for ten minutes, this is going to be pretty long. Lets talk about something. Like. well I don't know, hey, it sure was hot last week. I've lives in LOCNAME all my life, but that was still pretty hot, for September. I lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME and saw snow once in my life, that was when I was six or so and people say it sometimes snows in LOCNAME, I am starting to find that hard to believe. It's weird living in a smaller city, when I have to drive across town, you think this will take a hour, but it only takes about 00 minutes. The guy next to me keeps looking at me, it's starting to freak me out. I never knew I could put so many commas in a single sentence, the grammar checker in Word in putting little squiggly green lines all across the screen, hey it kind of' looks like my rhetoric paper's first draft, and the second. I don't like that class, why oh why do we have to take it? Well my 00 minutes it about up and I need to start heading to my chemistry class with a teacher that doesn't speak English very well, but it not hard to understand him, well at least I stay awake while tiring to decipher him. 
__label__label1 Stream of consciousness I have had a very rough week this week. I never dreamed that I would be so busy at college with classes and fraternity engagements; at least not on the weeknights. I feel that the sleep depravation may begin to catch up with me. Perhaps as time passes I will learn how to better manage my time on campus. It does not help that I have little, hour long breaks inbetween all of my classes, and I guess I should use that time to study, maybe outside the Student Union or the FAC building. We had a gentleman from the Learning Center come by the fraternity house and scare me by speaking about high school students whom have come to the university with straight A's and left with D's because they did not know how to study, for this I am a prime candidate. I never studied in high school save for calculus. At least I will not have trouble with Writing papers, as I am quite affluent with the subject. I write a lot in my English class, which is taught by a disorganized hippie. He is a nice man but is very difficult to gauge. This professor also has a very ludicrous way of assessing grades; he uses something called the Online Learning Record. I have yet to figure the whole thing out but it seems to me, that it is a totally fallacious way of determining a student's progress through his own introspection. I guess I am a product of conventional thinking and teaching; maybe the class will be good for me. I feel, at least overall, that my classes are very well taught with the one exception. I have, however, heard that my psychology professor gives very difficult tests, but I am a very good test taker, we'll see. My only real concern so far is time management and maintaining a decent level of sleep, which I have yet to achieve so far. I guess I need to skip a few social events and get some rest, though I have met a very nice girl already whom I like very much; I recently asked her to O. U. weekend and she politely accepted. Hopefully, our relationship will not crumble between now and the time of the game. There is another girl who I feel bad about not asking, though I imagine that she will find another date. We where seeing each other quite a bit before I met the other, though I am sure she does not care as much as I am probably pretending she is. I guess that this is enough, and would like to close by stating that the first two weeks have absolutely flown by, and I am hopeful that my grades will remain high throughout the semester. 
__label__label0 My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when PROPNAME came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. PROPNAME is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the ORGNAME ORGNAME. I am already into the Pre ORGNAME ORGNAME but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die. 
__label__label0 My mind is wandering back and forth between what I want to do and what I need to do. I need to study, read about a dozen chapters out ORGNAME my textbooks and learn the material inside and out, but I don't want to. I want to just remain calm and lie down on my bed with no worries and no setting of the alarm clock. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I'm actually in a rather uncomfortable state of mind right now, or in reality, I've been in that state of mind since the first day of school. It seems I have lost a lot of my drive and motivation, but I'm trying to gain it back. I want it BACK! Anyway, I am somewhat depressed and sad and I just feel uneasy. I want to be able to give my emotions freely, love in particular, but something always holds me back. Maybe I'm scared, I don't know. What am I going to do with my life? Now that's a question which really needs an answer, but do I have oneno, not me! I am currently a biology major, but I don't know if that is what I want to do. I don't want to go to medical school, but I don't know what else would be really interesting for me. I am very scared that I'm not going to find out what I want to be or should be and then I'm just going to be stuck. Competition is awful, especially between siblings. My brother knows what he wants to do, and I am 000% certain that he will be successful, in fact I know that he would be great at anything he decided to do. That's what I wantI want to know that I'm going to make it without a doubt or hesitation. This is the lack of motivation, inspiration, confidence, or whatever, I was referring to earlier. I use to be very strongwilled and I always set my mind to something and did it. Now, I know I still do that to a certain degree, but not as much, I WANT IT BACKNOW! I'm lonely and tired. I want to find some really good people who I can become really good friends with, but for some reason, I'm really not looking that hard. My social skills have also decided to go into hibernation for a while. Consequently, its my first year at ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME, surrounded by 00,000 people, and I don't even go out of my way to meet new people. That is something that is really starting to bother me, but hopefully as I get more familiar and comfortable with the system and environment everything will end up working out by itself. See normally, my thought would be that I would change and rise to the challenge because that's me, but not now, now I am depending on a nonexistent entity to "work out by itself. " Oh well, something needs to change. 
__label__label0 Well, I have just come back from a ORGNAME meeting, an organization I never thought have joining since it is for future health professionals. But after I finished talking to one of their alumni advisors, it seems certain there is stuff for a business major like me. Plus, a friend of mine is an officer. The only problem I've encountered is the interaction among new people or strangers. While at the meeting, I kind of shied away from interaction with these people but I could go up to a few people. such as the officers, and start a conversation. This has been my tragic flaw my entire life. I have this shyness and this fear of new interaction. I am quiet guy and just do not have that calm easy going matter to break the ice well. Part of the fear is embarrassing myself I suppose. Yes, sometimes I have had the guts to start conversations with new people or call up a girl and be spontaneous. Then, do I become relaxed, however, this courage seems to only come with an individual or a rather small group of maybe 000 people. The problem comes when I have to be exposed to a huge amount of people. I just get nervous and it happens all the time, the confidence just seems to die. I can get a few bursts of courage, but after a while I just give up. I keep telling myself that I have to just stay calm and be confident, but this trait of mine still keeps to be holding me down. Sometimes I even become too quiet and shy with my friends which is sad. That is why I feel reluctant at times to go to parties because of that loss of confidence to mingle and the quietness that weighs me down. But that is why I am hoping to be more active in student organizations this year and see if I can work to build this confidence to thwart off this nervousness of interacting with people. I feel I can do it, and although I may still be naturally shy, I will at least feel more confident in these situations. 
__label__label0 You know, being in a relationship is great. And I absolutely LOVE College. But I have discovered that it is REALLY hard to put the two of them together. I mean, PROPNAME and I have been together for about 0 ¸ monthssmall on the grand scale of things, I know, but it seems like an eternity. In fact, I find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before PROPNAME. He is, after all, my first real serious relationship. And I don't know. I mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn HARD to keep what we have in college. I love him. I mean really love him. He says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. I think that if you're in love, then you KNOW. So that means that he probably doesn't love me. We're lopsided. So that kind of sucks, but I deal with it, you know? I mean, sometimes it gets me down because when I say, "I love you" I don't hear one back. So, I get depressed. But he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and I guess that's enough to suffice. Maybe sometimes I feel like I just have enough love for the two of us, but other times I become really doubting. Maybe I don't love him either. I mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? How do we know that love even really exists? How do we know? I mean, yeah, there are songs, books, and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity. But how do I know that it's not just a really big "like. "? I mean, maybe that's all I have for PROPNAME really big like. That makes me think. Because, if it is just a really big like, then where did all of this "love" stuff come from? Do I say that I love him because it's my first real relationship and I just don't really know any better? Am I really just enamored with him because he was my first? Is the fact that I'm questioning it at all mean that it isn't real love? Don't they say that if you have to question love, then it isn't really love? I mean, I know that I would do anything for this boy. And I mean anything. I know that I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to be with him, to see him, to touch him, to smell him, to make him smile, to make him laugh, to hear his voice. I know that when I'm not with him, I am wondering where he is or what he's doing or wondering if he's wondering about me. But, it's like deep down, I know that he's not. He doesn't feel about me the way that I feel about him. And because he says that he likes me a lot, and he's not sure if it's love or not. since I like him more, that makes me think that what I feel must be love because it's on a higher level than that of which he feels. Logical, right? I didn't think so either. I guess I'm just confused. Most guys aren't as confusing as PROPNAME. Actually, for the most part, he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy. But he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him. I mean, I'm always wondering "ok, he says he's fine. but does that mean that he's really ok, or does that mean that he's still upset but doesn't want to tell me?" I mean I secondguess myself all of the time with him. I have a really low selfesteem when I'm around guys. I'm tall, so I always think that guys don't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter, cuter girl. I mean, PROPNAME is in a frat and he doesn't want me to go to parties with him. That REALLY hurts my feelings. I feel like it's because of a lot of reasons, but the main one being that I'm not pretty enough for him to "show me" to his brothers or whatever. Also, because he wants to not be attached to anyone at a party so that he can hook up with other girls for one night standssomething that he tells me he's done before. That really bothers me. He tells me that he's cheated on all of his girlfriends beforeso how do I know that he's not going to cheat on me, too? What assurances do I have???? How can I trust him? Especially when I know that he's done it before? How do I know he won't do it again? PROPNAME tells me "once a cheater, always a cheater. " Is she right? Should I not trust him? Do I have a choice?  
__label__label0 I am so tired right now. I don't understand any of the psychology professor pennebaker is talking about. what does he mean is this a good experiment? How can you tell? I hope the si session will help. I can wait for PROPNAME to come up here. I'm going to be so tired by sat. kris is nice, I hope I can get him a ticket. ;crap, meeting tonight. I need shoes though,. maybe ill skip it and go with LOCNAME, but I need to go to the store on the drag. its so cold in here. I miss sheniel. she is great. I need a nap. I hope PROPNAME doesn't get me sick, that would suck,. what is PROPNAME going to do at the party. I hope PROPNAME doesn't get upset with me for that. I don't have enough tshirts. I hope I can sneak him and bobby in. what are they going to do if I get caught? I don't know, PROPNAME did it successfully. I can't spell anything or type right. this assignment isn't hard, I hope they are all this easy because I know I'm going to have trouble in this class. I want it to rain real bad. I miss my mom and PROPNAME. I wonder what daddy is doing. I need some music in here. Doug better burn me a cd too. I can't believe my mom bought that frame for me. I wonder if she might like him now. I don't even see him now. maybe that's why she likes him. I don't want to get sick. I don't have a mommy. I sound like PROPNAME. very immature and youngish. I need to grow up, I'm referred to as a woman now. what ever. my hands and wrists hurt from typing. I'm not used to this. I hated my teacher. he was fat and old. why does my computer do that? It so annoying. I need to get excel on here. maybe I should buy it. 0 bucks not bad. damnit it's doing it again! I hate this. stupid red lines, I know I spelled it wrong! PROPNAME is on again. I wish we were still good friends. why is the sun out? I want rain. my head itches. its too cold here. my right forearm is now aching. I need to take a shower. I should get started on that speech, I wonder if what I have is enough. I like PROPNAME. the is young looking. quiz. read chapter 0 and 00. PROPNAME said she skimmed it. ill do that instead, easier. still have to skim psych. I hate that class. I'm such an idiot. shouldn't be in there. I want chocolate. why do I have to wait like that! Stupid computer. he sheneil! Yea, she's back. why? What's wrong with them. I'm sorry, I wish I could help you. that sucks. you maybe, mine are bothering me too. I'm getting too much drainage. I don't want to get sick. I haven't been coughing again, so that's good. this a such a weird assignment. I can't believe the thing said I haven't turned it in. I did it twice now. what a waste of time. he won't even read this. I could say fuck you pennebaker and he wouldn't know. not like id really say it, he is a funny guy, I am just dumb about his material. he doesn't stick to the book and give us good notes. I hate experiments. shit I still have to do economics. I can't get the hang of this college thing. PROPNAME is gone. I wanted to talk to him when I was done with this. I love PROPNAME. I can't wait until Friday. at least I can sleep on the way up there. I still have 00 minutes left. damn this assignment. I like sheneil a lot. its weird to know I'm saying one thing to her and thinking another. I'm so bored. I have other things to be doing instead of this. ok, think a little bit more about the speech and read, no skim, the rest of ch0 for psy, like that will help. this is hard because I can't spell and this computer is retarded. I hate this ;laptop! Who invented this anyways. I don't even take it to class. because I can't type and all my notes would not make any sense. sorry grandma. oh well, she doesn't know. I want chocolate right now. PROPNAME cookies. brynn is a very weird girl. I'm going to ha to spell check this, I hope that's allowed, other wise. well they wont read it anyways. www. psy. utexas. edu/what is is? Jp000 I think. I hate this chair. I want my one from home. i'll get it later when I go home. gnome? what is that? Ok time up 
__label__label0 So here are twenty minutes of PROPNAME's thoughts. As I sit hereORGNAME I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I'm agnostic ORGNAME proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept PROPNAME PROPNAME will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has "faith" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. I've never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it's there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I'm dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I'm gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in LOCNAME) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to "recruit. " At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have PROPNAME PROPNAME in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of ORGNAME and ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will "choose" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per PROPNAME PROPNAME that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from PROPNAME's ultraliberal mind. 
__label__label0 Ok, I am starting writing for 00 min. My thought, are what I am writing about. Right now I am still thinking about visiting my friends at LOCNAME this weekend, not sure If I want to do that. I have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what I have to do. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why I am thinking about visiting ORGNAME. I have to be back at 0 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also PROPNAME wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 0,0 in CS, chapter 0 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to ORGNAME tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see PROPNAME and PROPNAME and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with PROPNAME or PROPNAME, most everyone went back to see PROPNAME, I wish I was seeing PROPNAME, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them. Oh well, I can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant ORGNAME on Tuesday, I may go run then work out a while today I want to figure out what I am doing tonight first though. PROPNAME said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. So I am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, I need to work out defiantly this weekend. Hmmm, I wish I could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, PROPNAME keeps asking me to come visit her, which I should do but I am lazy, hah, I have no time for anything anymore, I squeeze in homework and studying, I need to do something about that, I would like to see PROPNAME though, I kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than I thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, I guess I have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl I have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, PROPNAME was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, I need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. I guess I will skip workout today and just go up at about 0:00 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore I thought would be. I just have weekend plans on my mind so I can't think of much else. Psy is fun, I need to be a little less tired Monday so I can enjoy it, I will work on that. Over and out. 
__label__label0 I've been thinking and this "freshman fifteen" thing has to be an urban legend. I mean, really, I've never walked so much in my entire life. Everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so I figure, if I walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. Then I run errands and visit my friends and before I know it I've had an entire week's workout. And then when I have extra time I go to the gym and I know I'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. For instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. So I know I'm not the only one who walks, like 00 miles a day and still goes to the gym. But let's suppose I rode the Campus Loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would I gain weight? No because the Jester cafeteria is not somewhere I go for seconds. Of course the food isn't the worst I've ever eaten, but I'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. And on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. There is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. It's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. Cheese Pizza: 00 grams of fat; Hamburger Topping: 0 grams of fat. How can you ignore that? But I guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something I want to avoid. I am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 00 miles a day, and still go to them gym because Gosh Darn It! I will not gain the freshman fifteen. I will not. I won't let it happen. I will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. I can't do it. I won't do it. I will not gain the freshman fifteen. Besides, it's just an urban legend anyway. 
__label__label1 This is very odd trying to track my thoughts by doing this. All I can think of right now is I can't type as fast as I think. I am slow at typing in general but this makes it even harder. So lets see what do we talk about. Today I have a long day cause I have four classes and I don't get home until late. Mondays and Wednesdays are my longest days. Anyways, this weekend my goal is to be caught up with all my reading and all the things I have to do for my classes. I have been enjoying college so far but I don't like the work aspect of it. There is just so much reading and constant memorizing and remembering it. It wasn't like this in high school but then again I am not in high school anymore. Let's see what else. My roommate spelled rice all over our room carpet just a minute go and now the room smells like Chinese food. She cleaned it all up but now the rug is greasy. So after I finish typing I will clean the carpet so it's not so greasy anymore. I am looking at the clock and I only have been typing for 0 minutes. I am tired already of this. I am looking at my little cousins' pictures right and I miss them very much. It's lonely here in college but I am working on having fun. But there doesn't seem like a whole lot to do that doesn't involve alcohol in some way. Everyone seems to just want to get junk and pass out and not even remember what they did the night before. I am not much of a drinker and certainly not to the point of getting junk and passing out. I like to just go out with friends and hang out and talk like we used to, but most of my friends are so spread out that we have to do the email thing for now. I like email because its' just wonderful. There are no long distance charges and you can send it in a second to anyone anywhere in the world. Oneday people are going to not be able to remember their lives before email. I don't even think they can now. I still can because I was just a freshman in high school when it first started getting popular. But I still like the days when we were not so technology driven. I like the later 00's and early 00's. Though I am not that old I can still remember those times where things didn't seem to be so fast paced. And now everyone is trying to be millionaire and wanting more and more of material things and just wanting to have a "good time" and not really caring in depth about things and people. Its just use and get ride of the next day. But then again there are other people who don't do this. I don't know. Now I am looking at the clock and seeing that I have been typing for fifteen minutes now and my fingers are getting really tired. I am glad I ate before I did this cause then I really would have been annoyed with this. Looks like it's going to be another hot day. I want it to cool down but I don't want it to rain when we have to go to class. It can rain on the weekend but not while we have to go to class cause that would cause more headaches. Anyways, I just want to be home right now. I want to be in my car and drive to the mall or just whatever. I miss being at home and I didn't get much of a summer this summer cause I was so busy preparing for college and making a list of things to buy and packing, and going and being in camp and just lots of stuff that I needed some more time of relaxation and enjoyment. Will I have about one more minutes of typing so I guess this is it. I don't know what I am even saying. Oh there I hit the 00minute mark ok I am going to stop typing now, goodbye. 
__label__label0      You know, I just don't know how to schedual my workouts and PROPNAME PROPNAME Do sessions. I think that four workout days and three tae kwon do days in a week sound pretty good. I could do chest, tris, and shoulders on Sunday, PROPNAME PROPNAME do on Monday, quads and hams on Tuesday, Tae Kwon Do on Wednesday, back and bis on Thursdays, Tae Kwon Do on Fridays, Calves and inner, outer and glutes on Saturday. I like that schedual because my time is not fully committed to one area of interest. I used to work out every day of the week. I also can't do that anymore because my interests in the martial arts prohibit me from emulating PROPNAME PROPNAME. The German Giant! That guy is swool. I think that's how you speel swool. As in it's swoolen. Hum, maybe it's swolen. Whatever, who cares? An English teacher ya but on stream of consiousness? Besides, what if my consiousness doesn't want me to spell it right. Maybe my mind is secretly liberal and is telling me to go against the 'establishment'. 'Damn the Man' and 'down with big brother'  and all of that. Maybe it's my secret way of avoiding conformity. That all sounds like bullshit to me but who can say otherwise besides me. I guess everyone now that I've said it's b. s. but that's not the point. The point is, of this tiny fragment of thought anyway, is that I could basically come up withany excuse I wanted to explain my actions and no one could say otherwise. Why can't you go up on the 'stand' and declare yourself that you were insane at the time of the murder. I mean, expertise and all that junk doesn't insure that from one, or maybe even no meeting at all, meeting a psychologist can determine that the accused was insane at the time of the crime. Does it really even make it more likely? Lets say that my mom was killed. I'd be pretty pissed and I'd break things and fight and all that fun stuff but would I classify myself as insane at the time? No, to myself anyway. If it could get me out of trouble ya, but I would know that I was really just pissed off and sad and all like that. But whatever, how can I talk about this? I have no credentials. Which brings up another point, why do you need credentials? Why do people always quote other people in research papers. I'm mostly talking about philosophy papers and diplomatic position papers. Why quote PROPNAME, was he so enormously intellegent that all your oqn thoughts are irrelevent? Why not write a paper about what you think? Maybe you have read some of PROPNAME's writing, then perhaps you should discuss your thoughts on that but why form an opinion entirely off what other people have said? What does that make you?  A follower, a person who does nothing but agrees. Whats that all about? How could anyone live just agreeing. It really does annoy me though, how people, some people, just quote other people. It's like you can't be wrong if you go with what some dead guy said. I say go with what you say. What's wrong with that. I'm going to make it a point to quote myself int he next paper I write fro psychology. I know that writing a position paper on an issue is your opinion but is it really YOUR opinion if you've already read what someone else has to say. I'd like to do nothing but read purely data filled reports and form my own opinions on what is going on. I also refuse to validate my position by incorporating a quote from a famous dead guy, or an alive one. What I say has importance because I am intelligent. 
__label__label0      whats up im tearing awwaaayyy  my name is Hope i like fish, and stuff like that, sarah's music is loud so it is hard to write i think. . my room has lilo and stitch in it a lot, my doll is funny from that movie it is green, it's name is PROPNAME i'm not really sure how to spell it. the suite mates across from us are very loud, they like to laugh a lotPROPNAME it's not really laughing it's more like cackling and shouting at the same time. . This drowning pool song is a good song but the lead singer died the other day. I wish my hair didn't take so long to dry and straighten and everything it gets annoying and makes me mad sometimes  the phone is ringing in the room across the bathroom they're so loud    I like goldfish i'm glad i got them from the campus store. . Grace is yelling 'give me a break' and clapping they are so loud it took me awhile to learn they're names because they're both so loud and its hard to distinguish them- i forgot my apostrophe in that it's but now i guess i don't need it   I wonder what brittany is doing today- she doesnt spell her name like PROPNAME so i always try to write it like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I haven't talked to her in awhile i really should call her more often but she lives so far. it's such a long walk. plus i should call PROPNAME, but PROPNAME doesnt call me so i don't know why i should    I don't know if she moved in with her boyfriend or if she lives at home, she invited me to hang out with her the other day and then her cell phone broke- i called PROPNAME's cell phone the other day  uh-oh Incubus  (not sure how to spell that)  and actually no i messaged taylor and it said it was his sister and he told me he had a new phone and gave his to her but i don't believe him. PROPNAME has cute hair, just because he's original with it. i miss the mall and visiting taylor at gadzooks before i went to work, i liked walking past there and seeing him, then seeing ashley and toni at electrocell, then going up the escalators to journeys and saying hi to russell and krystal and hollye   krystal owes me 00 dollars she has been so mean lately because she's so obsessed with her boyfriend   I don't think that a boyfriend should mean that much to somebody, they're just going to screw you over in the end, and you're going to need yoru friends to fall back on, unless of course you alienate them like shes done to all her friends. i miss kirkland's too, all my buds were there-it wasn't the same though without amber and brandye- i felt so bad for amber this weekend because robert didnt call her back- just another evident sign that boys are trouble    eddie is probably trouble i don't know why i like him   i can tell he's just another liar like PROPNAME-  PROPNAME broke my wittle heart i can't believe i let myself trust him, it is kind of upsetting to think how much he upset me and i still kept calling him, i won't do that again,, sarah's playing limp bizkit; at junior prom ben reagan drove me and we listened to limp bizkit on the way to dustin's house i thought it was unromantic, i can't believe dustin's dating amanda- shes actually pretty nice i went to that foam party with her the other night and she was cool   however she did call me and her and jenifer asked me to go to the game with them but when i said i didnt want to they said 'but we need your extra ticket'   awww our lady peace they are so awesome i was so happy that PROPNAME went withme to their concert even though she doesnt like them. i was kind of mad that she dragged us from the front near the stage to the back because she was hot    elimidate is onn!! i love that show, PROPNAME was on it and won, i wonder why cody hasnt called me maybe he thinks he'll get in trouble because he's a teacher and i'm a student or maybe i'm just not good enough for him    I don't konw but i should go back and visit Ms. PROPNAME and tell her i'm thinking about switching my major to art or architecture. i don't know i think architecture would be more fun then architectural engineering thats hard to spell. . . i would like to design things i just think there's not a lot of money in architecture or especially in studio art, but my mom says there is    she was really cool about my losing my check card the other day    i was so upset about it especially when i thought i had lost my UT id thingy too  that woulda sucked then i couldn't have gotten food i think that i type too fast, all the freshman in my BCIS class last year used to stare at me and be like whoa she types fast   and i'd be like yeah thats because i'm cooler than you. scott was in my class and he knew amber but he always called her nicole. i'm sleepy its 00 pm i think i should be in bed considering i have class at 0 tomorrow   i hafta go because i have to turn in my homework,   jenifer hancock and me worked on our homework together today in the study lounge,  when she took the top off her bottle-o-water it made a funny noise and i remember getting mad for some odd reason. . i want to go home this weekend but i think my friend's are going to want me to go to some parties with them  however   i don't drink so i don't think it will be that fun. sarah is doing her homework online i like when it says 'correct' i'm glad that sarah thinks the neighbors are loud too, i guess at they're house screaming this late was acceptable   omg and that girl yesterday sitting outside OUR door on her phone, what was she thinking???? she knew we saw her and she was just being loud to be mean i guess and i just wanted to open the door and be like HEY i can hear your whole conversation and i am trying to study so couldyou be q-u-i-e-t please but she wouldnt have understood anyways. . if i were to go home i don't think james would want me there, it's not really my house anyway, i hope they're watering my plant because i love it! especially the little pot its so small and fat   there was a pot like that at kirklands that crystal always talked about how cute it was and amber thought that i said krystal was a size 00 but i meant the crystal at kirklands and it was really funny i thought it was sweet how they got me that cookie cake   i am so mad that my mom left all that stuff in the fridge, and my shelves and parakeet from kirklands on the floor of the apartment   whatever there prolly weren't even any fleas i mean she got her zelda books but she couldnt get my stuff???  she said i left some shoes there i hope i got all the cute ones   what else was there i don't remember oh yeah my sea monkeys they had gotten big, there used to be a buncha little ones and now theres just a few big ones i thought that was funny i'm going to hafta get some more because thos were pretty cute 
__label__label1      I am very, very tired. I have not been getting enough sleep, I wake up too early for my eight o clock math classes, and I can never seem to go to bed earlier than 0 in the morning. I want to go to bed earlier, but for some reason I just can not. Maybe part of the problem is that I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper, and I even drink them late at night. It is probally the caffeine that is keeping me up. I am also feeling extremely stressed out at the moment. I went through rush and became a pledge in a sorority that I love. I went through the whole process by my self. Unlike many other girls, my parents did not really help me, or even want me to. Now that I have become a member, we are accpted to pay a lot of money and my parents are telling me we do not have it. It is extremely frusterating because they are being complety unsupportive. I told them that I would get a job and they said that if my grades suffered then I would have to quit the sorority and the job, but since they are not offering to pay much money towards it, what exactly is it that they want me to do?? I am also extremely frusterated that I do not have a computer yet. I am in the college of education, and I ordered an ibook from the UT computer store. When I placed the   order, they told me it would take up to two weeks for the computer to be   in. It has been a week and a half so far. I called the store today and the lady was extremely rude and said that it usually takes three weeks   for a customer to receive their product. I am using my roomate's   computer at the moment, and although she says that she does not mind, I feel bad constantly using it, and I would just be more comfortable if I had my own. I also feel sick. I have had a sore and extremely scratchy throat for what feels like weeks now. I never seem to get better. One day I might feel a little more lively and energetic but the next day I will just feel worse. You know, I am usually not this pessimistic. In fact I am proud of the fact that I am so optimistic, however at this moment, right now, I just have a lot of problems and a lot of stuff to be upset about. The whole cost of my sorority is really stressing me out. I know that my parents want me to quit, they were hinting at it on the phone last night, but I just do not want to. It is something that I have gone through, and it is something that I enjoy. I am the first person on either side of my family to have joined either a sorority or a fraternity, and I would like to uphold this. I would like to prove to them that their is nothing wrong with it. My family can sometimes be close minded and I would like to be the first one to open up their mind on this idea. Lets see, so I don't sound like a depressed, basket case, let me think of the positive aspects in my life right now. To begin, I absolutely and completely am in love with college. I love my dorm, I like my roomates and my suitemates and all of the people that live in my hall. I have already established some awesome friendships and I know that as the year progresses, they will only blossom. I like my classes. I mean school is school, but the classes I am taking are somewhat interesting to me, and I do not really mind studying these subjects. I am in the college of education; I want to be an elementary school teacher, and I am very much looking foward to that. I can not wait to begin working with children. I love kids. I would like to have  four someday. Preferabally two girls and two boys, but it is not like I would not be happy with whatever I get. I am from LOCNAME, and my parents and my two younger sisters live about fifteen minutes away. I have not seem my family all that much since I have moved in because I am trying to get the full college experience of going away. I almost decided against UT because I thought it was to close to home, but now I am so glad that I came here. However, the point of this was, I am not homesick because I have lived in LOCNAME for the last 0 years. It is cool though because I never spent much time down on campus, so it is almost like I am in a new city. The guy that lives down the hall laughs at me because I am so bad with directions and do now know where the closest ORGNAME of ORGNAME are from our dorm. But I always tell him that it is because I am not from this part, I mean i just do not know this whole downtown/campus area of LOCNAME very well. I am very excited because today I am beginning my diet and new excerise plan. Following a diet and watching myself lose weight always makes me feel better about my self. These are just some of my thoughts and feelings at this moment.  
__label__label1 Somtimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. Why am I falling in love with a guy that I can't be with? I mean, my gah, we're perfect for each other other than the fact that he thinks I'm some sort of deluded tricked person who is believing wrong (referring to my religion). We're both stubborn in the aspect of our beliefs and aren't willing to compromise however there is this unnaturally strong bond, I guess you could say, between us. I don't know what to do. I want to be with him so bad, I really honestly and truly do however I'm afraid of getitng hurt again. Maybe I am delusional, maybe its because I'm afraid I can't get a guy here. Maybe I don't know what I believe or not. I question what I really want and often wonder why I choose to live the way I do. Why do I sacrifice happiness for the sake of morality? Something that would make me happy, why do I avoid it? Because I'm afraid that God will condemn me to hell. Yes, that must be it. I know I'm saved and that I will go to heaven however I feel that other people will condemn me, I will condemn myself and ultimately God will condemn me. Fear of man, fear of myself, fear of God, fear of doing what I want, fear of getting pregnant if I choose to have sex, all of these things cause me inner turmoil. Why be with a guy that's all the way up in LOCNAME LOCNAME and you're down in LOCNAME? I love him, I want to be with him, but I'm denying my inner feelings somehow--I don't know 000% what I feel or how I feel it. . I don't know if I'm creating some sort of mental captivity for myself by not choosing to be with him--am I missing out on the best thing of my life?  He says all the right things, but does he truly mean what he says?  I guess only showing will prove it.   I do like this rose that he gave me. I mounted it on this background thing of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that I made. its a beautiful glass rose, but it broke in the mail. He was upset that it wasn't perfect however me and symbolism, I said it was better that it was broken because things aren't perfect, and even though it will be mended, it won't be perfect. And that's okay. Nothing is perfect. The rose is so beautiful. It offsets the background and the Statue of Liberty infront of it. I love LOCNAME LOCNAME. Do I love this guy because I love LOCNAME LOCNAME so much? Or do I love LOCNAME LOCNAME so much because I love this guy? Who knows? All I know is that its raining here, and I'm sitting alone in my dorm room, cold and alone. surrounded by the mass but alone in spirit. alone in body. alone. I think its stopped raining now, but I'm not sure if it will continue. I have no umbrella. I'm not prepared for the storm. Like life, huh? You can prepare yourself for everything except the most obvious--what happens if it rains? You prepare for the cold, you prepare for the wind, you prepare for the ice. . but the rain comes, and you have nothing. No umbrella, nothing. all you have is what you took with you. . your books, your clothes, your hand, the trees or a overhang of a building.   I came here to LOCNAME not knowing anything. I mean I knew what I've heard but I didn't actually know. I now know, and I don't know what to think. The mass is around me but I'm alone. . alone, cold standing in the rain with no umbrella. dreaming about the distance, and longing for the closeness.   I've thought about becoming a psychologist. . However I don't know if I want to abandon business. I don't know what I want to do really. I mean, I know certain things I like however I don't know what I want to do with what I like. I like many things but I love little. I've always helped people with their problems, listened to their issues, offered my advice when prompted. maybe its time I get paid for it, lol. . I wrote in my notebook about becoming a psychology professor--that way I can interact with students, be in authority and teach about psychology. but I don't know if I want to do that. . Why wouldn't I want to? Money, travelling, I don't know to be honest.   Wow, ten minutes and I've typed a novel. . Omg, I feel for the individual who has to read this, lol. I guess its a curse from typing since like the 0th grade. I think I can get up to like 000 words a minute now. . I was talking to this one guy online however I told him I would   brb in 00  . He has a crush on me. I don't like him. I know its for superficial reasons, but I don't wish to get in an internet relationship, lol. Yeah it would end up being an internet relationship. and I'm not about to go down that road, lol. . The first and ONLY one was this one guy who ended up being a clingy-blood-craving-dog-collar-wearing-submissive ex-goth who liked to bite people. Strange, eh? Weird guys fall for me, lol. One guy. . omg, the state hospital patient--He hit on me while I was volunteering there for bingo, omg. that was scary, haha. Then there was the drunk guy who said I was Miss America 0000--poor kid, lol. . Then, let's see. . the ex goth, the state hospital guy, the drunk dude. Hmm, I know there's more. . Ahh yes, boyfriend number one. The sex-craving chain smoker who was like 0 inches shorter than me. I learned from this guy to ALWAYS tell your mother about your relationships. That stupid dork called my house at midnight and was saying nasty things to my mother thinking it was me, lol. I came home and my door was off the hinges, my tv, stereo and phone were out and she changed the dead bolts on my door. THEN we proceeded to go to the health  clinic where I got the hepatitus A series vaccine (which is good to have anyways lol) and was threatened to get tested for AIDs. It was a traumatic experience, lol. Darn those junior high days lol. .   Well I have less than five minutes left and have managed to go thru most all of my relationships. LoL, wow, the more I remember them, the funnier they get. . my friends think they're hilarious lol. But one thing I've learned--I can't please everyone. I guess I have to live for myself and that's about it. Though I have religion and the morals that   confine   me with that--it should be done out of love. . but right now I don't have love. I want love to give to God, but I'm so caught up in what I want and the inner turmoil that its causing me to just want happiness with this guy, I managed to squeeze out love or desire to grow with God more. . Yes, it hurts to say it, and to acknowledge it. . but hey, I guess its the truth? I guess that's why this was the first assignment--so we can see what we really think and feel. . to write them out and to put them on the table so we can look at what we feel and not deny that we truly did think what we thought. Hmm. two and a half minutes left. .   I think I want to skip class. . lol, I'll go though. . I just hope I don't get rained on. A perfect ending to a perfect essay. . with one exception. Perfection doesn't exist. Morality doesn't want to exist. And I don't know where to find an umbrella.   In the last few seconds or minutes or whatever, my mind wonders to the pasta I had for lunch. NO clue as to why, lol, however I do like pasta. I wonder what I'll have for dinner. Wow, this writing went from super deep to super light, topic wise lol. . Grr, I got the Trojan and Mimic virus on my computer. . another lovely addition to another lovely day. Time is up and I have class to go to. Its been nice writing. . Maybe I'll do this again. . Typing of course--I can type faster than I can handwrite, lol. 0. 0. 0. Times up. . Ohh, I can continue writing. Well, I can't now. I have psychology class. 
__label__label0      This is the first writting assingment. I don't realy know what I am soposed to write about. I am also afraid that I will mispell a lot of words. I was talking with a friend on the way to class today. And we started to talk about this assingment. It made me kind of nervouse. But I guess he survived so I will too. I can't belive that only two minutes have passed. I guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers. And why they are so short. Some times I write a stream of consciousness down on paper. I think it is a good way to get my mind clear. If you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while. Then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something important that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it. I feel like   i should be talking about something more important. But I don't have anything important to talk about. My friend, The guy I mentioned earler, He said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about. I think that was probably a good idea. I kind of wish I did that. I feel like I am running out of things to say. So I guess that I will talk about what I see hear smell. Well I am in my room. I see the wall in fromt of me. I hear the computer game my room-mate is playing. He always plays a computer game. Always. but he is a real good guy. The computer game he is playing is some shoot um'up game. You run around with a gun ald kill people, Sleep with one eye open you say right? No its cool. Well I hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground, I guess because he can multi-task I hear music. he plays music movies and this game all at the same time. 00 Min!!! I don't like the song that just came on. What I see I see pictures on my wall. One is with my friend PROPNAME, We were at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We were in her cabin before the campers came. She had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin, that light up and have a siren when you push the button. So we were running around camp with them on our heads. It was kind of fun. I have know PROPNAME for a long time. We grew up togther. We went to camp togther and youth group conventions. She is realy up beat and friendly. Camp is a great place. I went there when I was a kid, And now I have been staff the past three summers. It is real wierd to see these kids come back evry summer and be a year older. They are so different. They were adorable or obnoxiouse. and now they change or are still the exact same way. You remember when the dident have braces. And now they are getting them off. I remember  when I had breaces. I hated them. But I only had them for one year. I had friends who had them for a long time. Four more mineuts. I realy can't spell and I wish I could. I am at a loss again. My desk is made out of wood. But it is not real wood. It is composit. It is a good desk it does waht it need to. My phone just rang. My room-mate just picked it up becaise I am on the computer with you. It is my friend PROPNAME she  was calling me back. I called her before I started writing. We were soposed to go to the gym. But I think she is there now. Ohh well. So maby abeer jon and I will got down to th  
__label__label0      I am listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME, The Promise, and this song makes me soo sad. I think about PROPNAME, and how this song completely makes me want to do what the song says. I want to find my way back to LOCNAME. I am actually going through a very emotional and frustrating time right now. I don't know how many things are going through my head but there is alot to think about. I don't know what I want to study. I have no goals, and that in itself is sooo frustrating. I want to be able to start working towards something. I love being able to definitely have a plan. I am not someone who can handle doing something unexpected. But I am starting to cope with. Another thing that I am dealing with right now, that I constantly have in the back of my mind, is the fact that I am in love with someone sooo far away, that I've spent a week with. I learned last night in my meditation class that love is the key to everyones happiness, or anunda. Everyone desires love; everyone wants to find and experience love. And once found, then nothing can become a barrier. But for me it is my parents money that is a barrier. I've never been on my own, and they are paying for everything right now. They pay for my apartment, schooling, books, and they give me a sum of money to live off of. I doubt that if I wanted to be a full time student that I would be able to have the luxuries that I do now, and have a job, and support myself. However, I want to experience my own dreams. I want to be able to say and do what I please with  no strings attatched. Man it feels good to say that. I only wish I had the courage to actually do what I am thinking. I want to travel and find love, and discover who I am before I can make any decisions whatsoever about my future. I am soo completely lost in the ideals of my upbringing and the conflicting ideals that I feel are more important. I fell that my parents have not experienced true happiness because they have chosen to live a conservative life full of restrictions both imposed by society and imposed by their own ignorance of what is True (with a capital t) I want to get away from it. PROPNAME t is going to take much courage on my part. TO part with everything I have grown up believing. Well, not entirely. I still posess the same morals and ideals of what a person should be to stay peaceful and good. However, the materialistic impositions that I have lived with, the restrictions of what I can do, and the expectations that they have of me that I will never fulfill. I can't speak to my parents without them shrugging or belittling my desires and aspirations. Obviously they are not letting me be who I strive to be. I want to have a guiltless consciousness. I want to be able to express myself without thinking of what my concervative and rude to say the least parents might think. I just decided that maybe I would enjoy being an elementary school teacher, and they shrugged and laughed, saying that I was taking the easy way out of college. However, if they had taken the time to listen to my reasoning, they would have found my reasons to be much more altruistic than that. Also, the fact that I dropped a biology class that I am not interested in and have not time to study for (considering my schedule at present) made them cringe. I had to listen to how all I am here for is a good time and how I am only taking 00 hours when my dad struggled with 00 hours. I am not them, and I don't believe in their repression. I am indeed repressed frrom becoming an individual and I am just now starting to climb out of my shell. I am looking for inspiration and motivation however, and I think love is my answer. I believe that whether it is not the True love, it is my steppng stone to following my dreams. Friendship is another thing that I treasure and that I despise in turn. My friends that I've grown up with are much different from me and we have been feeling the repercussions of these differences growing exponentially since we've all come to college. Sorority life is not my cup of tea, however, they are all very enthralled with sorority life and sisters, thus creating somewhat of a breech between us.  Music is such inspiration and is the key to expression and life. I wonder how many people are truly affected by music. How many peoppe let music into their heart. It can either devour you or bring you up. I find that itr can create certain moods, it can create certain sensations, and it can create certain motivations. Music can make you or break you in my opinion. I don't know what else to write. I am soo exhausted of thinking. It feels like I have been soulsearching for eternity, actually only the past couple of weeks. Since I found love, since I found myself. This may sound cheesy, wait no. It is not. It is me. And it is truthful. When I said it was cheesy, I was thinkging of what my parents would thingk. They would say that I am too young to love or to know what is right and what is for me. But I say hell no. I am not going to put up with that anymore. I knowwhat it is like to experience this. I was just interupted by these boys dopwn the hall who are really fun but who i havn't gotten to know so well yet. We wnet to dinner tonight,but it is only the stepping stone to a better relationship. I can't read them yet. For instance I don't know what they want from me. Some of them act a little shady. I don't know what kind of relati 
__label__label0      WEll college is something i was definetly not prepared for. In high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, I go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. So far in the during these 0-0 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. Which leaves me to consider that perhaps I should buy one of those rolling back packs. The readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. Although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting.           I really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. Always relying on fast food is disgusting. A person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. Which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. I have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. Because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. The peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. All they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them.        My classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. I believe i can do though. I have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. I wake- up at 0:00 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. She, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 0:00 am i am off to UT. Once i arrive on campus the time is 0 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. Our first class doesn't begin until 00 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. By the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 0pm and i get home at 0 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. But i realize i must read a chapter for Rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 00am, and once again i only get about 0 hours of sleep. This system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. I see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. Makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. Actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. I don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. This makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.            
__label__label1      I really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. It's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so I guess there is not much we can do about it. When i listen to music, I like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but I parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. I also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. Music helps me go to sleep also. I can never really fall asleep to it, but I will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. Speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. I've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. Why is that? Usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, I also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. I still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that I know they are ok, makes me feel better. Even if I keep going back to the same part of the dream I try my best to get them out of danger. I have a very strong family background. When I was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect  family and that nothing could ever go wrong. I always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. Their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. One of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. I don't think I could handle my mother calling me a name like that. I think I have a very good relationship with my mother but I know that I don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. I've noticed that I have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. I guess that is because I'm afraid to trust one person so much, but I don't think that is a bad thing. I just think that I'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. I guess that is because in junior high I had a group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what I do. Not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. I've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. I work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me. 
__label__label0      Im sitting in my room at the towers, and I have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. However I do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. And if I had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. Yet I can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the Towers has to be the food. The cooks here should go down in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. And everytime I go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. Which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. As I look around my room I can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. Because he eats all of my food. I went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. I havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. This fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing I am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. But every once in a while I do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences I can say that PROPNAME, the guy with whom I share a room with, is a very nice person and I believe that we will get along very well. So far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. My other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. And PROPNAME has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. Yet the one guy that I am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate PROPNAME. Its not that there is hostility between us its just that I try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time I get yet he just won't seem to respond. Maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. Because I know when I was in high school this new guy moved in from LOCNAME and he really kept to himself along with his parents. But the more time I spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. But the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk a whole lot. And i had to remind my mom that thats how people are in LOCNAME, and just to give them time because they are really good people. 
__label__label1      Well, my first psychology writing assignment, actually my frist real psychology assignment ever, in college. So technically this is my first assignment in the major of my choice. Stream-of-conciousness. Like weird PROPNAME stream-of-conciousness. That was weird. Hopefully my thoughts arent as weird as that character, well I can't even think of the book or the characters at the moment. So it didnt make that much of an impression upon me. I really am mad that I can't use my own computer for this assignment. Smoothies on keyboards don't make for easy using of all the keys. So here I am, in this girl across the hall from me's room, using her computer, trying to focus upon my thoughts and whatnot while people are playing loud music, opening boxes of poptarts, slapping me for writing about them in my first psychology assignment, etc. I can't work when its too loud. Of course the main problem with this whole stream-of-conciousness assignment is that now I am think about what I am thinking about. Take a minute on that one. Am I really writing what I am thinking about or what I want you, whoever is reading it, to read. Ok now to focus more. This is one of the weirdest assignments I've ever done. But I will confess, I've thought about writing a book in stream of conciousness style before. PROPNAME, PROPNAME (he wrote that way didnt he?) and PROPNAME. It can't be too hard, but to be honest when your thinking about the things your smelling and feeling and seeing, its not just whatever on the paper. ) Ahhh, the smell of poptarts wafting through the air. Definately chocolate, maybe s'more. It smells so warm, and inviting and delicious. It even makes the delicious stir-fry in Jester. i had stir fry today. The chicken was gross, the vegetables stale, almost a chore to chew it. So I did what all reasonable people would do, threw it away. Despite all the starving children throughout the world, etc. Money is going fast here. Faster than I thought, its going to be a pain to call and ask the parents for some more cash. But its not like it will be the first time, or even the last. Theres just some things in life that are expected, and one of them, is asking the 'rents for money. I hope my stream-of-conciousness writing is psuedo-interesting. I mean of course it won't be PROPNAME, but after all who is. Would I want it to be too PROPNAME? I don't think so, I would probably become more of a study in psych than a student. I wish I wouldnt have known anything about PROPNAME before this assignment, because in the back of my head, I see his dashes, random . . things, and mine isnt looking like that. Oh well. My hand is beginning to hurt a bit from typing non-stop. Oh well, in the name of science! Okay, people here are starting to talk to me while Im trying to concentrate. Talking about dust, and ORGNAME. And yes, of course when you use AC, dust increases. Its a POSITIVE correleation. People are starting to laugh at me and call me PROPNAME. All in good fun, yes I know. I'll show them. Haha. I want this girl to play PROPNAME PROPNAME, and she wont. Stubborn thing. Music, its funny to think about, there are so many kinds. Wow. I know about. 000000 songs. I think its safe to assume that. Whenever you assume, though, it makes an ass out of you and me. My old psych teacher used to spit those sayings at us during senior year. She was a little off her rocker. She worked at PROPNAME, but I think she used to be a patient there. Either way it was funny to watch her. Mrs. PROPNAME, the LOCNAME, Shivers. Wow. She was wild. Coco the Gorilla. That's all the lady would talk about. It was like CoCo was her damn gorilla or something. Haha, wow. Everything related to Coco. Funny old woman. And she would knit, all day, during class during lunch. She was odd. But who's to say whats normal? Im starting to think of this one time, when my mom told me that 0% of the world was sane. First off, that means there are a heck of a lot of crazy people running around. But then you start to think, 0%, holy mackeral, which side am I on? And then you finally realize, you arent one of those 0% whose 'normal'. Either way, its fine. I love psychology. Its bad, like cool bad, not bad bad. I worked two summers ago with a research psychologist in the VA/Baylor labs at the ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME. I saw all kinds of interesting things. Brain-slicing and the likes. This doc that I worked with, Dr. PROPNAME, was a card. I went with him to rounds. Mr. PROPNAME. The man, about 00, called me PROPNAME PROPNAME, and claimed that birds and horses around his house told him to kill the Jews, and his wife. The thing was, his wife was dead. Either way, it was interesting. There were so many like that. It was wild. Then, came the multiple personalities. Not for me, but I learned about them in psych class and read 'PROPNAME' and then I was off. I read 'When Rabbit Howls'- whoa. How interesting though! Oh no, I only have 0 minutes left, I want to keep talking about multiples. Anyway, then I read 'I Never Promised You a Rose Garden', that threw me off. She was a little weird. But hey, don't forget about that 0%, we all are. This wasnt so bad after all. I didnt really focus on things I was smelling or feeling, well kinda. Just mainly what I was thinking, which was enough for me, and I mean after all, I'm no PROPNAME, thank God. 
__label__label0      I suppose I should go to the Student Health center tomorrow to see about this stupid blocked up ear of mine. I walked in there today, but it looked like there was a division for international students or something, and I, as usual, didn't bother to ask around. I'll just give them a call or something to verify before I trek over there next. I wonder if PROPNAME checked in at Target for that television shelf mom saw. I'd like to go check for it and hang around with him this weekend, but I may be going back to LOCNAME. It'll be good to see mom, dad, and PROPNAME again. It's great up here, but it's obviously considerably different than it would be staying in the bed I've slept in for eighteen years. It's funny how that sort of thing works. Something so simple as a bed or a rug that has always seemed inconsequential can suddenly seem important once it's gone, though I suppose that's the way it goes regarding most things. Taking things for granted is much easier for most people. I really wish this bloody ear would unclog itself (bloody being the British exclamation, mind you. I have a tendency to drop into foreign exclamations some times, and I'm sure a writing assignment such as this wouldn't be particularly indicative of the situation surrounding the term. Yeesh, I rant quite a lot). I'm sure that last sentence is probably improperly punctuated, but I'm going to let it slide this time. Anyway, now I'm coming to the problem I expected would happen. I have nothing of real substance to put into the paper, though in essence that in itself is enough to fuel the writing. This is a stream of consciousness, after all, and noticing that being unable to come up with anything to type is just as fulfilling (and even as clichŽ)as any other topic. Huh. I seemed to have remember the alt command to activate the accented 'e'. Ahh, the little oddities one remembers from the subconscious. I find it incredibly amusing that I am typing this as though I were talking to someone as opposed to writing my traditionally lengthy essays. English class has taught me well, it would seem. Okay, I love this PROPNAME fold out chair and all, but the positioning at my desk is somewhat irritating. It's just a bit too low, so I have to set my ketboard in my lap to type, and the annoyance is exacerbated by the fact that my arms are bent when typing. It's uncomfortable, but not so much that I cannot type. I am going to arbitrarily place another paragraph now. This one has run on for far too long with out a break, irregardless of the fact that it is nothing but constantly flowing ideas.          There, much better, even though I momentarily forgot that tab changes the command field in Internet Explorer. I had to space over to start. Oh well, this is better now anyway. It's sort of a strange quirk I have that originated from my junior English class. Mrs. PROPNAME managed to ingrain certain formats into me, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. Hmm, scalp is itching. I think I want to go to the gym in the basement tonight. I haven't been in awhile, and since my ankle is better now, it will make things much more productive that my last excursion. And my computer just skipped on my Nightwish CD. That is annoying, though I supppose it's to be expectedf given the fact that I've got a few programs running. Five hundred and twelve megs of memory can only support so many applications. Listening to this music is great, though. There are so few metal bands with lead singers worth a shite (yes, there's another term from the British LOCNAME I like to incorporate)despite the fact that many of them have very talented instrumentalists. Most symphonic metal bands have superb synth and guitar parts, but I have a grudge against bad vocalists. That's why I like PROPNAME so much. I mean, you can't go wrong with an operatic soprano and good instrumentals. PROPNAME PROPNAME is also good. Never before have I heard a growling voice with as much musicality to it. Okay, I took a rather long pause there to serach the character map to find the command for the 'u' with an umlaut. I like to spell things properly, and PROPNAME's last name being German, I figured it deserved to have the proper notation. Language is important. It is the tool we use to communicate ideas, therefore I think we should respect it and use it properly lest we forget how to speak to each other in a distinguishable fashion. It is for that reason I dislike dialects of English that butcher it. Those dialects are more about the attitude of those who use them than the language. My time is running short, so I'll just type this last sentence until it's out. Oh, hey, look at that. It's not strictly a twenty minute paper. Well, as much as I wouldn't mind continuing this, I do have some work to do elsewhere. I prefer to direct my writing and creativity towards my novels and stories anyway. I'll finish them one of these days. Really, I will. &lt;/excuses&gt;  I really ought to just sit down and write them. Oh, I suppose not everyone will recognize that command in the brackets up there. It means 'end excuses', basically. It's a habit I picked up in IRC, which is an internet relay program. Technically, though, it's part of writing HTML. The backslash is the command that signifies the time to turn a variable off, or something to that effect. I could be wrong. I never really got into HTML or any other sort of coding. I don't have the patience for it. Heh. Look at that. I've already continued typing well past the timer. Anyway, I suppoe as a final note it should be said that all my 'ahh's and 'heh's and so forth are just onomatopoeia. And now my machine is gritching about IE. Bloody stupid ORGNAME. Ahh well, I suppose I'l just submit this now before I get shut off and lose it. 
__label__label0 Well, well, what to write about?  I'm sure this topic comes up often in a stream of conciousness writing assignment. I really wanted to complete this assignment a few days ago. I had an interesting dream that I think probably had some significant psychological value. I'm not sure if I can remember much of it, but I'll try to recall. Nope, sorry. Ha ha. Let's see, it said to write about your current observations. Here's what's happening: music is playing, room mate's music is also playing. I guess I should try to find a song that might be relevant to our next discussion topic in class, but I'm not sure what that is right now. It really makes me mad that I actually tried to go do a load of laundry and all the machines are full. I can't believe that the entire dorm of PROPNAME is supposed to share only four washing machines. That really sucks. I hate doing laundry as it is, but I refuse to wait in line. So, I decided to come do this assignment and figured the line would be gone. This is a good song, 000 - Amber. This is a slooowww twenty minutes. Last night was pretty boring, I didn't know of a whole lot going on. I should have called that PROPNAME chick or that PROPNAME girl. They're pretty hot. Wonder if they're interested in me?  I just met them, guess I shouldn't really wonder about that yet. They're cool to hang out with, except PROPNAME's friend PROPNAME is a BITCH. I can't believe I took them out and they left with some of their friends. Ah, Counting Crows, Mr. PROPNAME- good tune!  I think I'll call PROPNAME PROPNAME later and see what's up with PROPNAME. I wish I would have eaten lunch before I started this. pretty hungry. Wow, a whole 00 and a half min. left to go. Ha, Will just walked in here to see if I thought his hair was cool. PROPNAME and him are crazy guys. I wonder what I should go get for lunch today?  I guess I'll ask PROPNAME what he feels like. I wonder if there's a length requirement on this assignment?  Probably not. I bet some people will be half-ass'n though. I need to figure out what other homework I need to do this weekend. I know I have some math to work on if I have time, but I really need to read that Philosophy first. The last book, PROPNAME's Phaedo, was somewhat interesting, but was disheartening to learn that he was wrong at the discussion section on Friday. I just need to look at my PDA, I put all my assignments in there on Friday, I think. Man, I hope I can get some tickets to the ORGNAME and A and M game. Or the UT ORGNAME game. I don't understand the concepts of the draw exactly. The little draw sheet says I need to check out a website to get a wristband for the draw. I wonder what's going on back in LOCNAME?  Probably not a whole lot. I guess I should call Mom here after I get done. I forgot to call her yesterday. What else do I need to do today?  I'll feel better after I get done with this, it's been kind of hanging over my head since it's been assigned. I really feel sorry for whoever might read this, it's probably incredibly boring. I wonder what anyone can tell about me by stream of conciousness. Let's see, PROPNAME just walked by and wanted me to type   Zestfully Clean.   Guess we'll go eat in about 0 minutes. He thinks I should just be typing randomly instead of in sentences. Oooh, only four more minutes. I wonder how long this will be. I think those chairs we bought at Academy for the room yesterday are going to work out pretty well. I really like the table too. I just hope that after we buy the carpet that the room can be rearranged into a more efficient arrangment. That would be cool if this thing had spell checker on it. I'm impressed by the HTML timer though. I should learn something about HTML programming. I think some class I had said we would, can't remember which one that was. Wouldn't that be cool to get to a length limit?  Let's see, back to things to do today. Eat lunch, do laundry, do homework. Call Mom, call PROPNAME back, call PROPNAME and those guys back. Maybe I should call PROPNAME or PROPNAME?  I don't know, I just talked to them the other day. Might not be the best timing. Guess I should anyway. Man, I need to stop spending money. I want to add up my receipts and see how much I have spent. This is goin to be a killer Visa bill month. Time's almost up! Yea!   
__label__label1      Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that PROPNAME went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 0. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss PROPNAME and my family. Living in LOCNAME is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but PROPNAME is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in LOCNAME and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish PROPNAME was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope PROPNAME, ORGNAME and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think PROPNAME is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how PROPNAME and PROPNAME live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love ORGNAME. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope PROPNAME will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. 
__label__label0      My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 0 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. 
__label__label1      For the past two weeks, I've been down here in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, home of the largest university in the nation, and while I thought that I would have the time of my life, I cannot seem to move past the feeling that I am completely alone in a world of 00,000 students. I had wanted to come to this university for five years, but now that I'm here, im constantly thinking of ways to either get out or somehow to get used to it. The fact is, I left my friends. Although this is something that everyone going to college is faced with, the friends I left were the only ones that I had kept for more than 0 years since my family moved around often. And this time, leaving them was actually my decision!  I continually tell myself to just give it time and I will find my place. However, as I struggle being in a new city by myself, it seems that everyone that I talk to is having the time of their lives:  the time that I wanted and expected to have upon arrival in LOCNAME. Wanting to transfer closer to where my friends are occuppies much of my thoughts each and every day. I just can't move past it. It's as if the world is moving on without me. I feel as if I'm lost, and I don't know how to find myself again. Either I stay here and attempt to find the dream I had expected, or I find a way out of the city. Everyone seems so happy. Why can't I be like them?  I miss everything about my home, but most of all I miss how familiar everything was. I knew what was going to happen every day, and here, I don't know what to do with  myself!  Anyway, I really wish my roommate would come home every now and then!  I hardly see her. I miss my boyfriend so much!  I sound like such a typical teenage girl in saying that, but it's true. I miss my life before college. I hadn't realized how happy and lucky I truly was to have such amazing friends and family close by all the time. Perhaps I just need to get out there and truly find someone to talk to, but it feels like I've tried that already. I wish so much that I could just meet someone and right away have a friend! It's ridiculous to think that way, but honestly, the world would be a much friendlier place!  Okay, so now it seems like I'm just rambling on. I should go running sometime soon, but it's extremely hot outside!!  I cannot wait for this weekend because I have a ride home. See, I continually come back to this topic. I desperately hope that I maintain the same relationship with my friends. I feel so stressed out lately. I don't know what to expect yet from college, and calculus is absolutely killing me!  If I don't get an extremely high GPA, I might HAVE to transfer universities in order to get accepted into business. Why couldn't my life have just stood still during my senior year of high school?  I loved it, only I didn't know that I had the life I always wanted until I was forced to leave it and start over. I sound as if my life is falling apart, and it's not. Sometimes I just feel too overwhelmed with making new friends and meeting new people, keeping in touch with everyone and wishing they were here with me, and then there's the little fact that I'm supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my life at some point soon!  Business is just so general, so I thought it would be a great starting point. Who knows?  Definitely not me. I'm so confused right now. People are outside running right now. I should get out there and attempt to keep in shape. 
__label__label1  yes, here i am, finally. I never thought i would be doing this, ever. This is so weird. it's so weird, whenever i'm under any type ofpressure, i can never type well. it's so weird. but it's probably pretty common. everyone gets underpressure. i hate it thoguh. because i never feel like i'm  a good typist. i never was though. even when first started learning in 0th grade. i was always the last one to finish my lines, or whatever. 0th grade. that was so long ago. i was just thinking about that the other day. i remember that was a grade of so many changes. i just realized that i'm very nostalgic. i constantly look back on my past. maybe that's becasue i was sexually abused as a child. it's weird. i just read a quote a couple of weeks ago that said   life can can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.  That's so true. because i believe that everything in anyone's life, the way they are, their personality, their mannerisms, their characteristics, everything- stems from childhood. if someone is abused as a child, they will either become an abuser themself, or even worse, a serial killer, or they will spend the rest of their life dealing with it as best they can, praying to god that it will never happen again to them, or anyone else they love. that's me, i think. i'm obviously not going to abuse myslef, nor bacome a serial killer. i don't think. haha. no, i'm just kidding. don't worry, it's weird how one's thoughts wander, isnt it? i could never picture myself being a serial killer. i just hate dead bodies. they make me have nightmares. well, not really. but after i saw that movie, seven. . oh my gosh. i think my brain even squirmed. it was a good plot, though. i will admit that. that's another thing. you know how people criticize people like eminem and marilyn manson, and other outreagous people in the media? sometimes they can't help their success. sometimes they are just stopped on the street, and some exec says, hey i wnat to make money off of your emotions. and that's just what they do. they make huge names out of these people just so they can money, and then the stars themslves are happy because they can express themselves and they make money. so tehir success is just plain luck ,a lot of the time. so you can't always blame those peolpe for their success. blame the people that signed them. . okay, my 00 min are up, so i'm going to go now. wow, this was very theraputic , in a way. i'm goi g to make chicken parmesan tonight!! yum!!

__label__label0      As soon as I am done with this I plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. I don't really feel much like working. My biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. My telephone just rang. My air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that I have heard. Right now I am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. We ate at ORGNAME's and the food was salty. I wish I was in a cold swimming pool right now. This weekend was fun. We went swimming in the lake. College is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. I dont' miss them terribly, but I just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. Classes have not been that hard these first several days, and I am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. Now I seem to have nothing on my mind. I am just staring at the computer screen. All I really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. My neck is still a little sore. I will take some aspirin later. I will check my mailbox later today. My bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. Now I am not really thinking of much. I feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before I head out of my room. In fact, right when I am finished writing this I am going to lay on my bed. I am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. Only about 00 days until Christmas break. 
__label__label1 so IÕm in the computer lab of my apartment right now yeah these people in hear are kind of noisy. yeah I really wish I had my own computer, I talked with my dad today and he said maybe by Christmas theses walls are interesting. they really need to put paper in the copier and printer. I have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that I can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. IÕm thinking about what to write. what can I write that wonÕt be too ummmm whatÕs the word, I donÕt know lol. I wonder if theyÕll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah I donÕt seem like a weirdo hmmmm. I think IÕll eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and I have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then I can eat the Italian bread I got today with it too ah man IÕm getting really hungry, lol. ah man, itÕs only been 0 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. Like you can run a lap in 0O sec. doesnÕt sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesnÕt make any sense if you donÕt know what IÕm talking about. there was something else I was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok I forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what I mean about the no computer thing? Not having my own computer really stinks. So anyways. I think IÕm going to work out tonight. I usually donÕt like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isnÕt too bad. I think thatÕs because I can look out the window when IÕm running lol, even as IÕm typing this stuff I am thinking about totally different stuff than what I am typing. like when I was typing about the treadmill I was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since IÕve been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate letÕs me use her laptop sometimes so I donÕt have to come down here, but her keyboard is a French keyboard and itÕs really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. Ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow I fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because I was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb. I remember when I was little and I would be riding in the back of the car with my family and I would just be thinking to myself like everyone does, I guess, well anyways. and I remember how I would go backwards on my thoughts and think of how I got to what I was thinking about. probably what this writing assignment is trying to do well anyways. ooooo those brownies sound really good too. maybe IÕll make brownies when I get back upstairs ooooo those sound so good. I am so hungry!!!! I donÕt know what I would cook them in though. I donÕt know if we have a pan I guess IÕll find out when I get back upstairs IÕm almost done with my laundry. I need to start reading the psychology book too and taking notes. lol, I donÕt think I actually think about all the stuff I have to do as much as this writing assignment may make it seem I really hope I like architecture. lol, that was out of no where too. well actually the truth is that I canÕt type as fast as I can think and while IÕm typing IÕm actually thinking about other stuff than what I am typing. hmmm l0 minutes what made me think about architecture was that I was thinking about psychology and that made me remember how I thought about majoring in psychology (thatÕs really hard to type!), but that was after I had already made up my mind to major in architecture. I donÕt know if architecture is just a phase or if itÕs something I really want to do. I donÕt know. weÕll just have to see how it goes really I wonder why the time thing is green anyways.  I really, oh now I forgot. oh wait. I really hope it works out. IÕve even thought about government though so I can do something about womenÕs rights, I think that would be cool. maybe I could do both could I do both? I donÕt know this is so confusing, how are you suppose to already know what you want to do with your life!!?? But of course PROPNAME always knew he wanted to be a pilot. l0 min. now I wish I had more time I hate how everyone is oooooo ahhhhh air force academy. who the heck cares, its just the air force academy and no itÕs not impossible to get into I could have gotten in if I wanted to but I didnÕt want to I have no sympathy lol, yeah probably none of this makes a lot of sense since you donÕt know what IÕm talking about. but I donÕt think thatÕs the point. itÕs just to see how one thought leads to another and then another and so on. not really mattering what your thoughts actually are. just so you can see how one thing leads to another.  lol, I am SO redundant!!!!        
__label__label1 RIght now I'm thinking about not that much. I'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. I'm thinking about how I miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. It's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. He's just sitting there playing a video game and I'm really excited, but yet I still miss him and think about him. It's a rather cool feeling. I'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. I've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd I still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. I'm thinking also that I want to listen to music. Music relaxes me a lot, and I really enjoy listening to it will I'm doing mindless things. I enjoy it at other times too. I'm also craving sweets a lot. I'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. I'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in LOCNAME. Prior to this I read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 00th weding anneversary, but I couoldn't really htink of where it is. I'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. Earlier in teh day I watched hte first half of hte TExns game, so I'm also wondering if they won or not. My sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and I'm wondering if any day things willl get better. It's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so I'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what I can do to make it better for her. Randomly I also think about my parents. I just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. Normally I wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before I moved up here, so I think about him a lot more htat I probably would. My email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. I'm also thinking about my math class. I have homework to do in tehre later tonight. I really don't like the calss. It's riddle math, so I spend my time wondering about how I'm going to get thropugh there. Currently I  m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. THer are no equations, so it drives me crazy. I really don't want to even look at my homework. It's about the only homework I've procratinated on since I  ve been here. I'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. I have dizzyness problems, and I'm trying ot think of a time when I can see a doctor. My sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. Now I'm starting to feel stressed. Usually I don't feel stressed, but then again I usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. I'm wondering if I can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. It's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. I'm also trying to figure out when I'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. I've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. But now   m going to go to  a store tommorrow to finally get something. But I'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that I can get. I've never been to this store, but at 0 tommorrow I will find out about the stuff int ehre. According to my firned she says that I'll be able to find stuff there. Hopefully I will, otehrewise I'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd I'm constantly worrying about money. I am botehrd especially when I have to pay for unneccessary things. Which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. I'm also thinking about what position I would like to run for. Earlier today I went to an RHA meeting. Unfortuantly I missed the first half, so I didn't get all the information. I'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if I want to be an RA next year. THe other positions seem like high positions where I would have to campaign a lot, and I  m not that type of person. I'm still worrying somewhat about if I would have to campaign for my wing thing. I really would preffer to do that, I just hope I don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. Kind of like the girls who I think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. THose eveil people. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. Everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. Rather unfair. But I really get annoyed even when I see them. I've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. I  m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. I needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. THe noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. I'm not much into video games, unless I get to shoot something, but I still wonder what's going on over there. Or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. The same screen, all day long. I've wondered if it actually   fries   people's brains when they play. Or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. The noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. I'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. Supposedly it's only one hour, but I wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. I'm not sure how to tell my best friend if I dont' want to play. I do want to play, I just don't know if I'll have the time. But I also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. So that is a rather hard argument. Why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. I want to just expand time, and do everythign I want, and stop rushing through it and      
__label__label1      I really want to wear my new clothes tomorrow, especially my   pretty pink shirt but it goes really well with my new skirt so I want to   wear them together but i don't want to wear my skirt tomorrow   because it might rain and I don't want to get it all dirty. So may be I   will wear my red shirt tomorrow and the skirt the day after depending   on the weather. Or I could wear the pink shirt tomorrow and the red   shirt on tuesday and the denim one on friday or saturday then I can   wear the pink shirt again on next tuesday and I'll wear the skirt with   it. I don't know what I'll wear wednesday, maybe I'll borrow   something from PROPNAME. I can't wait until I turn 00 next month then I'll   be able to go clubbin on friday and saturday nights and  I won't have   to hang out with PROPNAME and PROPNAME' losery friends all the time and go   to there   parties   that really suck. I want to dance and get all freaky   on the dance floor like back home. Then PROPNAME can come visit or I'll   go to san Antonio and we can party. He is such an amazing dancer,   and so sexy, we would have so much fun. Hopefully I will get lots of   money for my birthday and I will be able to buy lots of cute clothes   and look even sexier than I arePROPNAMEy do!  I can't wait for my birthday. I   geuss I will celebrate it the week before with my parents when I go   home for the Homecoming game, and maybe I'll go tothe dance with   PROPNAME. Then on my actual bday weekend PROPNAME and jonny will   come up and I will party with them at some club or something and   maybe they will get a hotel room so I wonthave to sneak them into   my dorm room late at night because that may not work so well.   Then the next week PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME are definatly coming up   and we will have good times. I guess we could say that nikki is   PROPNAME and i'll register PROPNAME ad PROPNAME as my guests or we could just   hav a big slumber party at hanh's apartment. Speaking of slumber   parties, crystal and PROPNAME want to come visit for my bday weekend   also and I don't quite Know how that will work out with brandon and   jonny coming.      
__label__label1 Am not in the best of moods right now. I have something bothering me at this time. But I take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. I am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside.  However, life goes on. Am good now, or at least not feeling so down. This is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. Sounds really bad, but I console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others.   AT this very moment Am listening to music while typing. I really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. And it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. If you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. I always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow.   I decided to do my assignment now, because I was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time I will have. So if I don't do it now, I`ll probably not have sufficient time.   Guess what! Life in college is very stressing, so I always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. I always thought that I was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. But hey, life must go on, so I am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress.   I like my life right now, I really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, I know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what I am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life.    I don`t type that very well, so there will be I hope not too many errors. Life is one of the best things we have. We can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a GOOD impact.     
__label__label1 I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 0 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in LOCNAME and I've already been to the LOCNAME mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think LOCNAME has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a ORGNAME is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to LOCNAME I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at LOCNAME. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   
__label__label1      I'm super tired but I don't think i'll be able to sleep. I have a lot of reading to do too but I'm afraid I'll fall asleep if I crack open a book. I'm really wanting some candy right now but I already ate a huge dinner and I don't really need anything else. If you eat 0 hours before you go to bed it makes you fat so I shouldn't eat anything now. ER's on and I hate that show it's super cheesey and unreal.  Now Will and Grace is on and that's very funny. My younger brother just came out of the closet this summer so I watch it from a different view point now. He's only 00 and I'm wondering if he knows for sure that he's gay. I worry about him, I'm already super protective of him and this just makes me even paranoid about him because it's already such a crazy world out there and being in the gay community just makes it crazier. There are girls being loud outside my door, I don't really know anyone in my hall since this is my second year to live in the dorm I haven't really made any effort to meet anyone, neither has my roomate, we're justy very apathetic towards the whole dorm life now. I need to call my friends in a little bit and see what they're doing tonight anbd then decide if I should go out with them or not. I can read tomorrow during work, but that never seems to happen on Fridays. I also really need to work on my packet for spirits and figure out what project I'm going to do for it. I'm not sure if that's even really my thing. I was very involved all throughout highschool, but now I'm kindof worn out of all that stuff, and I would hate it if it turned out to be similar to a sorority because I hat ethat kind of stuff, it's so fake and i HAVeenough friends without having to pay for them. My roomate and best friend rushed this year but she didn't make it and I'm actually pretty relieved because it would have really changed her and I'd probably never have seen her anymore.  
__label__label0      I'm cold right now. I should get a blanket. I miss my boyfriend. I wonder if he's at work right now. It's 00:00 there. Someone's being loud in the hall. Maybe it's those weird girls that PROPNAME and I had to   look at   last night. They wouldn't stop chittering!  And it was almost 0 o'clock in the morning!  I had to wake up this morning at 0, but I didn't get up until 0:00. I hate waking up early. My eyes are all sleepy, and I couldn't keep them open in Spanish!  I love my Spanish class. Prof. PROPNAME is quite interesting. Oooh!  The 0nd season of Friends is coming out soon. I should get that. But I like Prof. PROPNAME. I like his accent. This morning he told us that we (0:00 class) are going to adopt a poor hispanic family in December for Christmas. What a good idea. I need to go and find a service organization to join. I think a sorority would be fun, too, but I don't feel like paying for my friends. My friend PROPNAME took out a loan for her sorority at ORGNAME. Silly girl. But it's typical of her. Yesterday was my birthday. I don't like being at school for birthdays, I've decided. You don't get as much attention here as at home. I felt kind of lost, in fact. My roomie brought me flowers, though. And mom sent 00 million presents. But it's not the same as being there. I don't want to go home, though. I like being away from home. I just miss my cat, though. I like having something warm and furry to come interrupt my homework. He's so cute!  I also miss my dad. Poor dad. Mom's going to drive him crazy. PROPNAME told me that he's going to start kayaking more often. Mom needs to get out more. All she does is sit at home, read, and worry about me. Definitely a disadvantage to be an only child. But I did have a pretty good child hood. I had enough friends. Too many, sometimes. I really like that PROPNAME character on PROPNAME. He reminds me of PROPNAME. Only, PROPNAME's not mentally ill. I would hate to have to wake up as early as PROPNAME does every day. Four-thirty in the morning is insane!  Silly ORGNAMEs. what do they possibly get done that early in the morning?  Don't they realize that the majority of their troops are ages 00-00?  I've heard that people in that age group, and then teenagers as well, are prone to stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning. Makes sense to me. I would do it every day if I could. I like staying up late (when I have the energy). For some reason I feel like I can get more done at night. Like cleaning/organizing my room, for example. Why would I want to do that at night when I'm just as capable of doing it in the morning?  That doesn't make any sense. I need to change the song on the stereo. I'm not in a very UB00 place. Righteous Brothers are good. But this song reminds me of PROPNAME again. I hope that the Marine ORGNAME Birthday Ball goes well in November. I'm really nervous. What should I wear?  Good grief, I never thought that I'd type that kind of question. How flaky. But I am still wondering what to wear. Would a gown work?  And what color?  This isn't like a school dance or anything. This is a real thing, where Marines and their wives/girlfriends are there. Older people, I mean. I always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. I feel like they're all wondering,   what is she doing with him?   or   she's way too young to be here.   My hands are beginnning to ache. I keep backspacing my mistakes. Perfectionist. That's me. I wonder if I really am one. Maybe not. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I should look at her schedule. if I can find it, I mean. My feet are cold. How do I keep that from happening?  And why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's?  Is it some sort of evolutionary thing?  Or just another one of those differences?  I miss my friends. Maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. But I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. And PROPNAME. I couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. My mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. Whatever. She could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. I don't get it. Sometimes I feel like she's the best friend ever. But then other times (*most times) I feel like I'm being left behind again. Why do I get left out?  I think I'd like me if I were someone else. Even when I'm with PROPNAME, or PROPNAME, when we're in a group, I'm not the popular one. I really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.  
__label__label1      My mind is blank right now. I'm doing this late so i'm nervous that it won't count for credit. i went swimming today, but i wish i hadn't because then this would be on time. sometimes i get homesick, i called my mom today and she was talking about my cousin's wedding. she was surprised that i was willing to pay for my plane ticket there. i think i would regret it if  i didn't go. i've never been to boston before. i hear that it's very historical. I guess they have good clam chowder there, that's what people say. I like clam chowder, but i've only had the kind that comes in a can, so i guess i haven't had real clam chowder. i like a lot of foods from a can. people laugh at me because i still like spaghetti-o's. oh well. they laugh at a lot of things I eat. I really hope this counts for credit. It's only an hour late. I can't believe I forgot, I'm usually so good with homework. If it doesn't count, at least i can still try to get good grades on everything else and maybe i can still get an A. i have to try really hard, i guess even harder now that i realize i am forgetting things, but i want to go to graduate school to get my Ph. D. in psychology. so hopefully i'll start remembering to do all my homework. i've been pretty good with keeping up with the reading in all my classes, but it's a lot of reading. i knew college would be a lot more work than high school, but i never imagined all the reading. i'm actually enjoying this writing assignment, i haven't written in a journal or anything in a long time. it feels good to get things out. i used to write poetry too. that made me feel a lot better when i was sad. usually it had to do with guys. they always find a way to make me feel bad. it felt good to be able to turn something bad into something good. i should get back into writing poetry, maybe someday it'll actually be good. i only let a couple people read it and they said they were good, but you never know if they're just saying that or not. i like a couple of them but i usually eventually decide that they're not very good after a while. my two favorite ones are lost somewhere. that really upsets me. i wrote them on a plane. i know i didn't lose them on the plane but when i packed to move here, i still couldn't find them. i wrote them in a spiral but i have a lot of half used spirals. i hope nobody took it. i don't like it when people read my poems. only if i show them and even then it's hard. i don't know why, i  guess it's because they're so personal, it's like i'm completely open and vulnerable when people read my poems. they read my most personal thoughts when they read them. except for a few, some thoughts i just don't put on paper. some things that i'm really not proud of would really not be best on paper because then i'd have to look at them again, or someone else could read it. my parents go through my sister's stuff sometimes, so i assume that they go through mine too. i hope the don't find the pictures from the party at my house. i forgot to bring those and they would probably cut me off if they knew i had a party there. it was fun though. that was the best party. everyone said so, so i know it wasn't just me who had fun. people were dancing and everything and everyone was getting along, usually somebody gets in a fight at parties. boys are so stupid. wouldn't that be a funny last sentence? that seems to be a pretty good conclusion though. it always seems to come around to that. 
__label__label0 In about 00 minutes I have to start getting ready for work. I don't want to go, but I need to make money so I can go out. My mom called me yesterday and said that my bank account was getting low and she wanted to know what I was spending it on. I was supposed to use the money for a stereo, but it's amazing how fast five hundred dollars can go in LOCNAME. I love LOCNAME so far. Tonight I'm going to a PROPNAME PROPNAME concert. I should probably stay home and study, but I would like to meet more people in LOCNAME too, so I'll probably still go. My mom also griped at me about how I need to study more. I just spent seven dollars today on washing clothes. This makes me mad because I can think of much better things to do with my money besides wash clothes. Four loads of clothes costs seven dollars. How ridiculous. I'm going home on Saturday because one of my friends is turning nineteen and they are having a party for him. I just went back home like two weeks ago, but I don't want to miss his birthday. I can't wait to see everyone from back home. My roommate is cooking her some Roman noodles and I can't decide if I want to eat some or not. I don't think so. I really wanted to lay out by the pool today, because I really need to get a tan, but I spent the whole day cleaning house and washing clothes. What fun! I haven't gotten any of my checks in from work yet and it's making me wonder because I have been working there for a while now and only one check so far has come in. I guess they don't realize I'm a college student and I need money as soon as possible. I really want to get a tattoo and that is probably the main reason I want my checks to start coming in. If my mom knew that I wanted a tattoo she would kill me. Oh well, I'll keep it a secret for a while, and then by the time she finds out it will have already been a long time since I got it. My roommate wants one too, but she's already talked to her mom about it. I really need to go to an audio store because my system in my car stopped working and I can't stand not having bass when I listen to music. It better get done soon. I really need to read this book for a freshmen seminar class I have. The book is pretty boring, but it's easy reading so I guess I'll survive. I'm really dreading going to work in a minute. I wish I could just skip to tonight and go out already. That just sounds so much more appealing! I have to go to the bathroom, but I guess I'm not supposed to because I have to sit here and keep typing my thoughts. My roommate has the PROPNAME PROPNAME on and it's kind of hard for me to keep my train of thought, but I guess that is the whole point to just write down everything that is going through your head. The drive home on Saturday is going to be so long, but it will be worth it I guess because it is going to be so much fun. It feels so nice to have a clean house. I just cleaned my room for the first time in about a week and it was getting pretty bad. My roommates boyfriend is sleeping right now and I have the music pretty loud. I should probably turn it down. We went out last night. We went to someone's apartment and it wasn't that fun. Oh yeah! I forgot the cops came. Good thing they weren't coming for us thought because that would have sucked if the party would have been broken up. I didn't even swim with everyone else because I didn't bring my bathing suit. I hope I remember to bring it next time because it looked really fun to sit in the hot tub. I'm fixing to pee in my pants. I wish this timer would hurry up and run out. I just took that pretest for the experimental requirement too and that had to be the longest testing thing I have ever taken. I didn't think it was ever going to end. I guess the hour and a half of credit they give you for doing it is well worth it. I'm getting pretty nervous about all the tests that are coming up. It seems like they are all during the same week. That is  going to kill me I just know it. The more I think about those tests the more I think I should probably stay home tonight. Naa! I'll just go out. I find myself saying that more and more when I really need to stay home and study. I have to do good this semester though so I can keep my scholarships. I can't remember what GPA I have to have to keep them. 
__label__label0 So I'm in the room with 0 guys and another girl and they're having this conversation that's really distracting me. Not to worry, I'll soon be engulfed in my own stream of consciousness and I'm sure this will turn out really funny. Actually, right now I'm laughing because they were making fun of my job. Haha. Alright, back to business. This is one of my favorite things to do. My friend just distracted me by trying to read this. Anyway, work was long and boring today. Lots of restlessnes and paranoia. Haha, the people in the room are being really funny. This guy is telling a really descriptive story (which is how I tell stories) and the other guy is all like,   get to the point!    I'm avoiding trying to read what I just wrote so that I can move on to the next paragraph. Everyone thinks its funny that I'm taking this so seriously. Its really hard to concentrate!!  PROPNAME, why do people fall for people who are already in relationships?  And why do I think I actually have a chance?  I think I have a really big chance. But I don't have long term goals. Hmm. I enjoy anticipation and a challenge, and that's what the person I have a crush on is to me. Its really exciting. It got quiet all of a sudden. Funny how that happens. I like it. I like the awkwardness. Uh oh, they're talking about sex now!  Got to love college kids. Ahhh!  So, my throat is dry, I'm about to grab a beer. And I'm one of those who actually like beer for the taste of it. Just call me a beer enthusiast. I'm not even sure if I spelled that correctly. You know, I won the spelling bee in 0th grade. And in 0th grade, I lost because I got the word   condemn   and I spelled it c-o-n-d-o-m. And I didn't understand why the judges were laughing until 0 years later. Anyway, I have 0 and a half minutes left and the person I have a crush on hasn't called yet. She's supposed to come over and play Battleship with me and my friends. I really wish she could break free from her controlling boyfriend. But I'm not one to judge her relationship since I was the controlling figure in my last relationship. ::sigh::  Lets not talk about my last relationship, I'll go to that bad place in my head. No regrets, no regrets. Alright, so I am really tempted to call her now. Umm, how is this computer going to organize my thoughts?  Haha, I work for a computer company. Actually, the biggest computer company in probably the world right now. But that's not really important. Not saying that my thoughts aren't important because I believe everything I say or think has some huge significance. Even if I can't understand them. I don't even know if that made sense. Its hot in here. I hate laptops. PROPNAME just told his roomate to grab me a beer. I should tell them to call PROPNAME to get her to come over here. Sometimes people need a little push out the door, know what I mean?  I wonder if these pants look too big on me, they're really comfortable. My nostrils are flaring. People think its cute. I am done. Ok, maybe not. I have to keep going for like 0 minutes. My friends are making small talk. Small talk is funny. Ahh yes, a beer. Except I don't like drinking out of cans. Why is that?  I love bottles. And PROPNAME PROPNAME. I take after my father. But then again, I love white zinfandel, which is my mother's favorite wine. Woah, its almost 0:00 and she still hasn't called yet. I'm getting upset. Maybe a little obsessed. I make myself laugh. Now I'm listening to them talk about me. I like the attention. Count down. 
__label__label0 The one thing that amazes me the most is the  complexity of the female mind. At one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. Also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. If you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. The more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. The only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. True, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. No matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. I've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand. The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. The more you drink it in, the better it feels. You know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. Then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. Reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. The only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. The old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. It may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. Somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. That or it seems less pathetic.     It's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. When I was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. My parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that I listened to, so I always told myself that if I ever became a musician, I would never include those kind of things in my songs. However, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. However, I wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of PROPNAME. I also think that people overreact to his music. He is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician. 
__label__label0 Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 0 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 0000 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA000, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 0 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in LOCNAME, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 00 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 00 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $00 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 0 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to ORGNAME's next football game. The one against LOCNAME LOCNAME was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when PROPNAME from LOCNAME LOCNAME is seen in LOCNAME LOCNAME, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 00 seconds left. . 0 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. 
__label__label0      Wow, I remember when my english teacher made me do this. It is kind of weird having to do it now. I don't think my teacher really liked english at all. What was the deal with the random acts of kindness journal anyway?  PROPNAME PROPNAME is a great musician. I should put his CD on now to break the silence. 00 minutes?  I think I might have to piss sometime in the next 00 minutes. I guess I should have thought of that sooner. I need some   my-size   chicks in my classes. I see them around campus occasionally, but never in my classes. Actually, there may have been some in Psy. , but there were 000+ people. Damn it! I don't need to install any more MS stuff. Quit popping up that update!  I said okay yesterday hoping it would cut me a break, but it is just like the ORGNAME ORGNAME . once you donate stuff, they never give you a break. Hoo Hah!  PROPNAMEe for some PROPNAME. Man, I love the woofer on my computer!  I have the best,   phattest   bass on my computer stereo. I think my parents miss me. When I call them, it is hard to get off of the phone ever. I hope that I don't get much homework in college. I like SNL, where Tim PROPNAME did that sketch with the SportsCenter impersonation.   Right about now, the funk soul brother PROPNAME PROPNAME!  Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Sweet sassy molassy!    I can't wait until PROPNAME PROPNAME comes back to LOCNAME. His concert was cool. I need to keep on writing. ORGNAME ORGNAME was a sweet film. I really like the girlfriend in that movieGoddamn update reminder just froze up my computer!!!! ORGNAME is an evil empire!  They don't even give you a way to close the reminder so you just have to leave it there. Crapola!  Don't even ask me when I want to be reminded of the update. Suck it, PROPNAME!  I bet I seem kind of screwed up if anyone browses this. I love the PROPNAME song   comfortable,   even though it is a chick song. I wonder if these shoes make me look gay when I wear them with shorts?  Oh well, they are comfortable, so whoa, I just spaced out there for a few minutes. I really should go change the punctuation of the previous sentence. I have always felt like I am missing out on something by never having a girlfriend. LOCNAME kind of sucked. Maybe it is like getting a car- it is cool for a week or two, and then it loses its glamor. I wonder why no one is sunbathing on Jester beach Damn it! I don't want to update my computer! I did it yesterday!  I miss the good 'ole DOS days. Go to hell, PROPNAME!  Man, for a multi-billionaire, you would think he could get a friggin' descent haircut. It looks nice outside, with the warm sun rays blanketing the gently swaying oak limbs outside my grimy window. I wonder why people say it is a nice day outside, when it is actually better to have cloudy skies to block UV rays and keep me from having to squint. I think the people across the hall are kind of strange. Not PROPNAME and PROPNAME, but their suitemates. They have all those slutty posters on their wall and whenever I walk by they are playing computer games. Dr. Pepper is the shiznat!  Shiznat . he he he he he!  I am such a friggin' loser! Criminy!  I just lost it again for about 00-00 seconds. I only have two minutes to go now, so I think it is time for a new paragraph.  My fingers are tingling a little bit, which is pretty strange since they should be getting blood from my typing. Oh, well. Maybe I should have kept playing guitar instead of biking. Racing is fun, but you can play guitar anywhere and you don't have to worry about crashing or winning or anything like that. You just can't screw up much while playing in front of an audience. I just copied most of my writing so I can see how much I did. 
__label__label0 Well this is the first time that I have ever been told to write for twenty minutes straight about what is going on inside of my head. Anyways, yeah it is early in the morning and I just got back from calculus, and I am extremley tired. The reason that I am tired is because I did not get a lot of sleep this weekend. I really wanted to catch up on my sleep but it did not really happen. The reason for this is, that on Saturday night I did not go to bed until like four or five in the morning and then I needed to wake up semi-early to do some necessary homework. I really am a night person and I do not ever mind staying up late even when I have to wake up early the next morning. Well anyways, school has been its usual self. I am really enjoying the college life and the freedom from my parents, but I miss all of my friends so much. I really wish we had more vacation time so that I could spend it with my friends. The person that I miss the most, is of course my sister. We have grown up our whole lives together, and now that she is actually maturing and becoming a normal person, I am not there to see it and it is kind of sad. Anyways, also I miss PROPNAME a lot. I mean I realized how good of friends we were, but since we have both gone to college, I realize it even more. He is the one that can always put me in a good mood when I am upset. He can always make me feel so much better about myself. I can never get mad at the kid, even if he says the rudest things or the most inconciderate things. He is a great friend and someone that I will always want to be in touch with. I mean saturday night we talked on the phone for like four hours. I mean that is a lot of talking. I never thought I could talk on the phone that much, but with him the conversation is never boring, never worthless, never repetitive. It is always something new and great to hear. Yeah we have our moments where we say somethings to each other that normally if anyone else said that stuff we would get really angry, but we know that we really do not mean it, and that we are really good friends. Well enough about him, he already occupies enough of my time. Twenty minutes is a really long time to type, considering that the first time I did this my computer like froze or something when I pushed the finish button, which really made me mad. Well I also have this other friend named PROPNAME, whom I have known since like sixth grade and have like since sixth grade. He goes to school here and we hang out a lot, but he has a girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME, whom I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon. We had open door night last night, and our room won cutest runner up. I do not know who won cutest overall, but we were happy with what we got. It is finally about to come to and end and my hands are in a lot of pain and will be relieved when they do not have to type anymore. Well less than thirty seconds and it is all over. I am way pumped over here.  
__label__label0      Alright, so this is my second time to do this, which is kind of weird. It's kind of draining to type out what you are thinking. I'm still worried about what I am going to do for my object exercise in Acting I. So many people have taken my ideas. But since we are all the same age, we pretty much have the same issues and experiences so I'm just going to go with what comes natural to me. Ugh, I still can't get ahold of PROPNAME. Unfortunately, openning night for his play falls on OU weekend which really sucks. Ugh, it seems like everything going on in my life conflicts with everything else. Speaking of OT game, the things they make us do just to tickets to some game. I mean, first you have to wait in line to get a wristband and PRAY that you get a somewhat decent number. And then you have to go back and wait in line for the tickets, that is assuming you even get tickets. It's crazy and aboult a million people came up to me today asking me to get them tickets. Geez, I never thought going to a football game would be so stressful. On top of that, this week is the anniversary of September 00th and so now everywhere I go I am reminded of this horrible tragedy. I'm proud of our country coming together, but I don't think we should dwell on the bad things. We should move on, remember, and renew. For example, this morning I flipped on my TV and the first thing I have to see the images of 0,000 American people losing their lives. It just hasn't been a good day. Hopefully, Friday (yes, Friday the 00th) will be a bit better. Could this week spell   hell   more than one way?  Actually, tomorrow should be a pretty good day. Although it's going to be hectic, tomorrow night will at least be the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. OH YEAH!  Go Alpha Phi!  I'm excited since PROPNAME gets to come too. It's going to be tons of fun. And this week is Big Sis week so I get a lil gift everyday too!  It's funny how little good things can measure out the big bad things. Oh and plus I am going home this weekend. Going home this weekend is just the thing I need. I miss my family and my dog sooo much. Aww, my cute little Pepper. I can't wait to see her. And my mom can wash some of my clothes for me!  WOOHOO!  Oh, and Friday night is callbacks for the play PROPNAME. I am soo excited because I actually made a callback on my first audition here at LOCNAME. So that's one more good thing. Wow, maybe I should go over all the good things in my life more often. Then maybe I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed and stressed out as much. hmm, after this I better start reading biology. For being such a somber day, today (weather wise at least) was actually a really beautiful day. I have a great view of the sunset out my window. And since there is a church right across the street, the sunset lights up the huge cross so beautifully. Maybe one day I should take a picture of it. Oh yeah, I need to buy some more sticky tape to hang my posters with. You'd think something called   Poster Putty   would do the job but aparently the posters made out of paper are toooo heavy. And what's the deal with not being able to hang dorm lights. First of all, christmas lights are a dorm tradition, and secondly the package says   Dorm   lights so technically they aren't christmas lights. right?             
__label__label0      I am really tired. I got up this morning at 0:00 to go get tickets for the seniors in my fraternity, and I don't even know if I'll get to go. They're for the LOCNAME vs. OU game in October. I was up last night until 0:00 and I had to wake up at 0:00 this morning to go wait in line at the stadium. I have the song   ORGNAME ORGNAME   by PROPNAME PROPNAME in my head because last night, after walking PROPNAME back to her room, I came in to find three half-naked, drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate. They were making him play   LOCNAME LOCNAME   while they sung and taped the entire episode. They claimed to be filming   Towers Gone Wild,   which was a take-off of   Girls Gone Wild,   only filmed at Towers. I have recently been seeing a cute girl, but I am sort-of afraid of commitment. Twenty minutes seems to me like a long time to type. I've barely made it through six minutes, and I am pretty much ready to go to bed and stop doing this. This girl is really cute and sweet, but I just got over a really hard break-up, and I am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen. I think that it is funny that, although I'm supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness, my spelling and grammar are almost impeccable. I wonder if the person who reads this will agree. I probab;y made a typo on some really easy word, and therefore the grader will assume that I am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults. Or maybe that's me talking. Maybe I'm   grading   myself when I say something like that. Nine minutes and forty three seconds. It's funny that by the time I had written   nine minutes and forty three seconds,   that time had passed. I am now very ready to stop this assignment. Twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for, but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping. I wonder what Tank is doing. I wonder if PROPNAME is going to come over to   see   him. I don't like PROPNAME very much. I think she's very annoying. She whines far too much. Now I'm whining about her. I hope I'm not keeping my roommate up with my typing. This keyboard is pretty loud. I still have to write for another seven minutes. My neck itches. There, that's better. My composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since I mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar. Tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought. He doesn't really respect people's space too much. But he's an overall pretty good guy. If I go to sleep in fifteen minutes, I can take a three and a half hour nap before I have to be at the house to build. I am not going to Philosophy. I am too tired. I don't really think I'll be missing too much, because if I did go, I would fall asleep in there as well. My bed is much more comfortable than those tables in the Law Building. That is a really long walk. I takes thirty minutes. My back hurts. I need a shower. I need a cup of iced tea. I actually don't NEED either of those. I just WANT a shower and a cup of iced tea. And a nap. I'm a pretty funny guy, if I put my mind to it. Right now, I'm not putting my mind to anything but sleep. English was boring today. just like every other day. I think I probably failed that reading quiz. I probably got a fifty. I read about fifty percent of the selection. My professor must be pretty good at making quizzes if they're that accurate. I never had that happen in high school. I'm just going to stop now. Good night. 
__label__label0    Okay i really do not know what to say frankly i have never done a writing assignment not knowing what the topic is or what ia m expected to write but all i know is that i have to write or type for the next twenty minutes which for me seems like it is fairly a small amount of time since i type really slow. Anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class, no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice. I love psych, i actually want to be an elementary counselor, i guess i choose this because my parents split up and i guess i want to help students or young kids to understand this whole mess. it really does not matter anymore although to be frank i wish things were the way the were before, not for me but for my younger sister she has suffered a lot from the desicion my parents made, well actually my mother, but who is to blame, I guess that is all in the past and i can't change that. well enough of that i am really glad that we can just type and type just letting our little heads just take us somewhere i reall appreciate this since i am not worried about how this will be graded i think i just have a little anxiety when it comes to papers, i guess i have to get into the idea that college is totally different form high school. i think my problem is that i know that everyone is expecting a lot from me since i am the first in the family to attend a big university, both in my dads family and in my immediate family. i am afraid of letting them down sometimes i really can't take it but i just know that everyone is behnd me i guess that motivates me and at the same time that kind of puts a bunch of pressure on my shoulders. i guess it is because my brother is or should be like a junior but i frankly think that he is just being a drain in the economy, i mean i probably saw him studying once in a whole semester and that was probably just cramming for his final exams. right now i really do not know whta ha plans on doing he just simply needs to get his act together not that i always do but at least i know that i won't hurt my parents the way he does. I guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin. She would just so die she would never think that i lied to her telling her that i would be living alone. i really feel guilty do not get me wrong but what can i do if she would have opened herself a little towards me then i would have probably told her, who am i trying to kid i guess that is just my excuse i have asked my mom several times already if she would let me get married and she said no, well she said wait at least two yeras i really do not knowhy i need to wait two years, she says that has nothing to do with my boyfriend which is true they get along real good i really do not know if it is that he speaks spanish or if it is the fact that he is real nice, oh did i mention that he gets paid really good. I do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad, i hope she understands a little. i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on. when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad, and i really do not want him to find out yet, you see my dad is depressed, the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier, and he says i am like his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already. i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do  not agree with the way i am living it. as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me, i hate when people say don't get married because then you won't go back to school i will prove all them wrong i will teach them, i know that you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it 
__label__label0 I really don't feel like sitting here and typing for twenty minutes, but what ever. I'm kinda tired. All I want to do is go take a nap. I really don't want to go back to LOCNAME, I get lonely. I hate this stupid town, but I don't want to leave home, but then again I do , the air is cold when I breathe in  and I need to go take my medicine  oh well I'll go do that later  crap I'm tired and I don't want to go read either it gets so long and boring and I'm not doing that research crap for justin either why do my toes always get so cold the rest of my body is warm but not my toes, I wonder if I have fever again my nose is running but it's stopped up at the same time , that retarded I feel like going to sleep right now, why is the timer not working? is this stupid thing supposed to be working cause if I don't get credit for doing this thing I'm going to be pissed, it's probably this retarded ass computer. stupid shit never works  I don't  want to go back I like school I just wish I knew peeps up there it's going to be a long four years damn it I just wish I was already graduated and working and not worrying about any thing, just making money for my-self not depending on other people this way I could do what I want why can't I do what I want I don't mean bad illegal things just I don't know stuff  I swear I'm not coming home any more if my parents don't stop trying to give me a curfew, what the hell I'm out of high school I'm in freaking' college, and my dad still calls me tell me it's 0:00 and I need to come home what? ugh I swear, man I better do good in school oh well I'm not worried about that yet not until I have tests then I'll probably freak out stress out what ever my face itches my lips are chapped I wonder why though it's not cold or anything but it is cold in this house why am I always so damn cold it's points less to shave my hair is all grown back on my legs and I shaved last night I don't know why I bother to shave stupid shit why are cuss words bad" words what is it that makes them bad, the meaning isn't bad when you think bout it I guess not, do they even have a meaning for real why are they so bad hm I don't know here we go with the goose bumps again man I have o get up early tomorrow ugh and I have to read a lot of crap oh and print my homework still damn I hope I remember to do that shit I better not forget god when are the freaking twenty minutes up? and why is this timer not working? what the hell  maybe it tells me my time when I press the end button, haha presh = push and press I'm so retarded but I hope that it shows my time when I finish cause if I have to trype for another twenty minutes I'll be pissed or pised like on the sweetest thing, what ever LeAnn your so retarded man I need to figure out how to get the internet in my dorm just in case I have to do this thingy over again, hm dad has birthday this friday, yeah I get to come down here again, I kinda miss home if you think about it , but I'm not going to tell any one cause they'll just say see I told you so, but the only thing I miss is the people I hate this fucking retarded hick town and I like being out on my own I just HATE being by my self I get so lonely man I got to stop thinking about this other wise I'll make myself homesick oh well I'll just have to suck it up and not worry about it cause I'm not dropping out or transferring I went through a lot of shit just to get here now damn it I'm staying I just don't like living in the stupid dorms oh god I don't want to go back there.

__label__label0 Wow, the person next door has their music up too loud, but now they turned it down. I can't wait until the party tonight. I'm not normally excited about parties, my foot hurts, I moved it. Well, I'm at 00 sec. Hmm. there comes the music again. I don't like that kind of music otherwise it wouldn't bother me. What does PROPNAME's computer say?  She was playing solitaire. My wrist itched and I scratched it. Is that how you spell scratched?  It doesn't look right. It's funny how simple words often don't seem like they're spelled right. Words like of. I could think of where the o key was, there I did it again. Two minutes and 00 sec. The green light on my router box is flashing. I guess, it's supposed to, though I would think a solid light would mean it was working right. I want to know who actually reads this kind of thing, or if it is read. It might be interesting, I suppose. I bet people write some pretty crazy stuff. I almost wrote shit there, but then realized that might be inappropriate, which is funny since I just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers. Particularly if they're crazy. I make my self laugh inside sometimes. Oh goodness, I'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper. I had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness. 0 minutes and 00 sec. Wow, this is going by pretty quickly. The scroll bar just started. My headphones are sitting next to my computer. I'd like to be listening to some music right now, but of course, not my neighbor's music. Maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME or Counting Crows, or Dave Matthews Band or I could get my new PROPNAME PROPNAME cd from my car. I really like every song on that cd. My dad called today. We haven't talked since I've been back here in LOCNAME. I remember last year we talked about every other night for a while. I guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart. I'm very close to my dad. Wow, I'm writing as if I'm talking to someone now, which I'm not. I should stop that. Hmmm. deep breath in and out. LOCNAME. I wish he was on-line, I'd really like him to come to the party tonight. It should be fun. PROPNAME will be there though, and he did say he might go to LOCNAME with me tomorrow. That's nice of him, but I guess, maybe he owes me because I did take him home at 0 in the morning last night (this morning). Wow, someone could find out all the crazy shit, there I said it, about someone's life by reading these writings. Writing, I haven't written in my journals in a long time. I have been writing some in the on-line diary though. so yeah. PROPNAME doesn't read it though. This is hard to not edit my thoughts. Every now and then, I think about something and then skip to something else, then realize I should be writing everything that comes into my head down. So, I am making a conscious effort not to edit, I had to look at the title of the page again to see how to spell that. I'm typically I good speller. Maybe it's the pressure of this writing assignment. 00min and 00 sec. Man, this semester, all my professors have really great websites for their classes. I'm so impressed. I wish I was good at creating web pages. Then I'd make one for myself, moved my feet situation again, and again, I'd let everyone know about my webpage and situating myself, I'd, scratched my eyebrow, I'd update my webpage every day. Scratch my ear. I don't know why I'm itching all the sudden, couldn't find the c key. Well, looked at ORGNAME's computer again. She has so many more people on her buddy list then I do. I have people on my buddy list that I don't even talk to when they're on-line. well, a number of the people on her buddy list on people from the PROPNAME PROPNAME message boards, I wanted to call them bulletin boards, but that's not what they're called. Anyway, scratching. tapping my foot. seeing that word tapping doesn't look like it's spelled correctly. Oh well. I guess this really isn't for a grade, so it doesn't matter if I spell things correctly and do our minds spell . correctly. I don't know. I'd like to be a part of the ta's studies with the tape recorder catching small glimpses into my conversations throughout the day (though I don't have fabulous conversations) or the study about people's relationships and why people stay together and why they don't. I mean, someone should do a study on PROPNAME and I,  I wouldn't necessarily call us dysfunctional, but I surely could be wrong in staying around for him for so long because yeah, he could treat me better, or pay me, scratching, more attention, scratching. I'm getting really uncomfortable, my neck and left arm is starting to cramp up, I haven't had to type this much in a long time. I guess, because I haven't had to write any kind of paper in quite some time. Well only less than 0 minutes left. This has been fun. I'm really uncomfortable. I'd like to read some other people's writings from our class. I am curious what you can tell about a person from something like this. Is is even accurate, because couldn't someone just create some elaborate/or un-elaborate story to put down here, or poetry or something. Hopefully, it doesn't sound like that's what I'm doing because I'm not. Now, I sound paranoid, oh goodness. well, nearly done. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0         
__label__label0 I wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 00 degrees in my room. I had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and I'm generally a hot natured person. The thought of winter coming makes me really excited. I like summer, but it just stays too hot. Maybe I should have gone to college in LOCNAME or somewhere a lot cooler. I don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. I'm just always hot. I get it from my dad, he is the same way. We are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. PROPNAME was another person I could do that with, but I never see him anymore. He should come down and visit, I know he likes it in LOCNAME. I am surprised that I am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. I don't even live in the same town anymore, I'm 0 and a half hours away, why does it matter. Maybe if I had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, I wouldn't care as much. So far, I have been really disappointed with the college parties I have been to. They are nothing like the ones on TV, which I know TV isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). I almost wish I hadn't brought my TV, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. I need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. I would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so I might as well make myself as popular as possible here. The more people you know the better off you are. If that's true, I'm in trouble. The friends that I had down here before I moved are still my friends, but I want to find my own group. I feel welcome among my other friends, but I don't feel at home. I have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. The FIG is stupid. When I signed up for it, the only reason I did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. Now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. There is one girl in there I'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. I tell myself I'm going to talk to people when I sit next to them in class, but every time I end up convincing myself not to. In my hometown of PROPNAME, LOCNAME, there were about 000 students in my high school, so I knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. Now I'm going to a school of over 00,000 students. No one would even know if I didn't show up for a month. In PROPNAME, I'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. Fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. I sometimes just watch the clock when I'm bored, like in church. This weekend will be the best one so far. I am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. Plus, I want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that I find attractive. I'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. Dress to impress. I never go out looking worse than I want people to see me as. It's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. I am nothing special here. There is nothing that I can do, or that I know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. That has been a really humbling experience. 
__label__label1 Okay, let's see. I'm really really stressed out right now over Calculus. I feel like I am doing so horrible in it. I made what I consider to be a pretty crappy grade on the homework that was due last night, and all it was was a review. I got a 00. 0. The homework before that I got something like an 00. 0. My goal as of last night is to make a B in the class for the semester. I'm really worried about it though because I really have been studying hard and it seems as though the hard work isn't really paying off. I just need to find some people who know what they're doing to study with and do the homework with. That'd be nice, but I don't know anybody. The only other class I'm seriously worried about, ironically, is this one, Psychology. I don't know what to expect yet all I keep hearing is about how hard it is. I love psychology and am really interested in the material, but I'm still extremely apprehensive. I guess I'm just worried I'm going to do really bad or something. I want to have about a 0. 0 ORGNAME or higher. I don't rightly know how that whole scale works, so I'm not sure how hard that is to do exactly. I'm just so stressed out it seems. This weekend was my birthday and all my friends wanted me to go out and do things, and that's all good, but I actually wanted to stay home and study. I really have been worried. I haven't been really social either. I'm normally a fairly sociable person, or at least I think I am, but lately, I've just been studying. On top of that, I never really make much effort to meet the other girls on my wing, or go out with new people, or even meet that many people in my classes or anything. I have to admit that I have made a few friends, but I guess I had some preconception of my coming here and just being bombarded with cool people and making really awesome connections. I haven't really done that yet. I still get depressed and my eating habits, though better when I first arrived, are starting to diminish fast. What really sucks is that I've found out a way to binge and purge here as well. I was hoping that living in a place with a communal bathroom I would have to stop all that, and that it would be a great leap for me in my recovery, but I've found a way. It's horrible. I see myself slipping more and more each day, and the old thoughts of how easy it would be are starting to come back. I really do hate myself so much sometimes. I feel so worthless. It's like in Calculus, I've been working my ass off and I'm still doing shitty. I don't have any friends, I don't have any self-esteem, and I have horrible social anxiety. It's so bad sometimes. It's been worse lately. Like today, I feel fat and ugly, so therefore I do not look up when I walk, I don't make any attempt to talk to anyone and when they talk to me I have to pretend to give a shit and be perky, whereas I feel so pressured to say something of meaning or something funny or something that's even remotely interesting that I end up saying less. I just hate it. I have nothing to be afraid of, that's what they tell me, but that's just the way it's always been. I hate being alone, and though I'm not really depressed, or at least not as much as I have been in the past, I'm just so damn lonely. I just want someone who I can talk to and laugh with and do things with. It always seems as though I have nothing. The only thing right now in my life it seems is my education. And I work and work and work, and even then it doesn't pay off. Or at least that's how it feels. I know what I am doing, I know what I am, and I'm trying to conquer it, and I've been doing damn good all things considered, but it's just so hard sometimes. I'm going to try and go to a rush function tonight at the business school for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety. I know I'm going to have to get drunk before I go otherwise I'm not going to have anything to talk about or even talk to anyone. It's so horrible. There is no difference between me and the person I am when I'm wasted except that I have no inhibitions and I'm not afraid to be myself. I don't think about what they're going to say or think of me if I do this or that. It's still me, I just can't be me unless I'm like that when I first meet someone. All my friends like me for who I am, but most all of them I met when I was drunk. If I had met them sober, maybe we wouldn't have been friends. Thinking about how I'm typing this makes me think it doesn't make much sense, but it does in my head, and that's all that matters here right?  I'm pretty sure that's the point. It doesn't matter if someone else can read it and make sense out of it, it's just that I know what I'm talking about. AAAHHHH!  I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to do. I'm worried about the thing tonight, I feel fat and ugly, Calculus is depressing me, and then Psychology is just scaring the shit out of me. I hate the way I feel. It's as though everything is bearing down on me and I don't know how to control it. I can carry the weight, but I am having an extremely hard time and I don't want to be carrying it. I wish it would just fall off. I just need to calm down and be more focused. My goals seem so hard to attain at the is point. Help. 
__label__label1 my room seems nice, I mean it's not like home or anything, but the privacy compensates. I wonder what mom and dad are doing. Hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia Juany    but anyways, my roommate is making noise by the mirror. it's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and I turned it on. I simply left downstairs for 0 minutes and I come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel, just surfing the channels when I wanted to watch the my show. anyways now that that is out I can continue. yeah, my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator. I went back home last weekend. I bought a couple of books which I want to read, but seem to have no time to do it; I have a ton of class reading. well, biology seems like it's going to be easy, chem. a little work, nutrition just pay attention during class. c. c a lot of reading. my roommate always eats late at night and I'm trying to help her get better eating habits, but in my opinion, she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight. her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines. this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me, like I want to talk on the phone with them. I don't like talking on the phone. I should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless I'm doing absolutely nothing; I don't like to get distracted especially if I'm watching tv, or doing some kind of school work. she (roommate) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are . 00 cents     yeah, I haven't done any laundry since I got here but I can still manage with what I have in my closet. I really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers. well, it would help if I got all my book first. I'm missing one coincidently it's psy, I went yesterday and they have no more. hopefully by tomorrow they do I need to go over there after class. thank goodness I only have one class tomorrow. I have to finish my ch and c. c homework, shower, check mail, write my tuition check. red robin,  I worked there an entire year last year,  too much work for not enough money. my roommate was my superior there, but I worked as well as she did ,and many of times better (simply because the team liked me better)      it's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her. don't get me wrong my roommate is a great girl; I've known her since 0th grade. I like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what's on her mind. yeah, they're calling her up to ask her to work this weekend, I'm not working there until the break. yeah, this time around I'm registering for my classes early, so I don't have closed classes like this semester    but I have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester, having to move a lot of things around    well time is almost up    so later            
__label__label1 I'm just sitting here typing. Mu light is pretty bright. I got it at office max. I got it with my mom the last night she was here in LOCNAME before she went home. We had gone to target earlier that night and I saw one of my friend's car parked outside. It was weird because he is going to LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My psychology book says PROPNAME on it and I am assuming that that is one of the writers of the book. There's a picture of my sister and me on my book case. We went to LOCNAME last summer. It was fun. We stayed on a tiny little island with my entire family . There is a little PROPNAME guy sitting next to the picture looking at me. He is not actually looking at me because he doesn't have eyes, but his carved out eyes are pointed in my direction. My grandparents gave it to me. They are pretty cool. My grandfather was in the navy. I've been to LOCNAME many times and I always go to my mom's uncle's house and play with all my little cousins. Those are some fun times. I'm taking Management Information Systems 000 with PROPNAME. She seems pretty cool. The book is red and has a little blue box on the side that says ORGNAME ORGNAME. Come to think of it, I think my econ book is also published by ORGNAME ORGNAME. I was listening to a song earlier by a band called Outlandish. Good song. There's a sticky note underneath my lamp. My mom gave me this biscotti tub. I don't know why, but she did. I keep mints in it. I have a pack of green gum sitting next to me. It's doblement, the good kind. I'm already tired of writing and I'm only 0 and a half minutes in to this. I still have mono so that could be attributing to my tiredness. I have had it since late February, early March. It's a pain in the butt. I was fine for a while, but right before school started, I could feel it coming back. It's weird how I can feel it coming back. My roommate had to go to some scholarship dinner. I don't know when he will be back, but he is pretty cool. My computer speakers were made by Harmon/kardon. I had never heard of them before. Maybe I had, but they aren't a big named company yet. This could be their way of promoting their product. By striking a deal with HP. My monitor is big. It's a 00 inch Flat Panel. It's nice on my eyes. I used to sometimes wear contacts. I hate those things. They make my eyes all messed up. By the end of the day, my eyes hurt so bad, I can't even stand to keep them open. So I decided to go with glasses. I wear them at night and when I'm in class sometimes. I can see alright without them, but there is some things that I really need them for. My spanish teacher is kind of weird. I wasn't sure what I thought of him at first. But he seems like an alright guy. I saw him at the gym the other day. I need to work out more. But sometimes I'm just too tired or not in the mood or just don't want to go. My ex-girlfriend used to encourage me to go. I actually started going for her. But then gave it up when I got mono. I used to go to the athletic club. I remember walking in from the cold december days after school. It was still cold in january and february. I love the feel after working out. When my whole body feels numb. I don't know what causes it, but it feels good. It's even better when you work out inside and then go outside where it's really cold. I love that feeling too. But yeah, I went running the other day and got that numb feeling when I was done. My dad runs a lot. He is super cool. He went to LOCNAME LOCNAME and all that and still he is a lot of fun. He is serious when serious stuff needs to be done, but all the other times he is cool. My mom does a lot for me too. She helped me move in and whatnot after my dad had to go back. I haven't eaten candy since I have been here. I have decided that candy is one thing that I don't need. I've been trying to eat better and I think I've been doing a good job. I take vitamins every morning and try to eat something too. I have never eaten breakfast and I regret not doing so. I have started trying to eat breakfast but it's just not appealing to me. Oh well. My ceiling has all these little bumps in it. My mom painted my sisters room and used a sponge thing and made the walls kind of bumpy. It is cool. It reminds me of a sky kind of. I went to the football game on Sunday. That was awesome. Quite the blow out. It rained a lot of the game, but it was still fun. It was my first UT football game. My sister goes to ORGNAME and I went to one of her games, but they have no school spirit. Here, everyone gets involved and that's what makes it so much fun. I went down to the box office to get a football ticket for a friend, but they said that I probably wouldn't be able to get one because they were almost all sold out and I would have to wait until Friday to even try. It should be a good game though. We are playing LOCNAME at 00 am. Early game compared to last weekends 0pm game. Last game I went in to the wrong gate and had to walk all the way around to find my seat. 
__label__label1 Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called PROPNAME" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called "college life. "  I feel at home and myself here in LOCNAME. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. 
__label__label0 ow. I just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. I bump intot stuff a lot. I think that it's because I don't pay much attention or maybe because I'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about  the wall in front of me. I ramble a lot too and I don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. I've told the people at the management place and I don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and I'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if I don't like having the lights on?  what if I'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way I can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing I'm not like that. I don't type as well as I wish I did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. I forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, I hope it's not overdue. I already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when I told him I scratched the car?  it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when I messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and I don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if I ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when I know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because I have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. I don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and I don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. I like sharing my opinion. I even like it when people get mad or offended. I don't know why, I just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. I can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid I thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what I think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that I think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but I would never tell her that, and I certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. I think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because I only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if I can't talk to you I don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, I'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be EVIL, god forbid. God forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. I hate stupid people. I'm sorry, I'm a mean person. I don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. I hate when people ask me how I like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, I hate asking people stuff like that so I don't and I expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that I hate that. they don't know me there's no way they COULD know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. I am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. I wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do I mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. I don't think I have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then I feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. I think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up 
__label__label0 It is really really very very cold in my room. I do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. I am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. I am glad I brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one ORGNAME those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww I just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. I wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all I have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn't all that fun. I need to borrow duct tape so I can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is COLD. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe I should figure out the whole bus system so I can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and I do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs I would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time I am done this I will go work out for awhile. but then I will have to take another shower. don't know if it is worth that. because then I will also have to dry my hair and I hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and I am sticking to it because I hate putting makeup on. it's a pain. a waste of time, if  you will. the cd stopped. I should put another one on. now I'm going to have 'yo's a ho' stuck in my head. it's not a bad song just not a song I would like to have stuck in my head. I always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it's weird. I don't know where they come from. last night I had a dream that I was yelling at erin. in someone's driveway- until she walked out on the street. I am unsure of what we were yelling about but I don't think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. I have an itch on my leg. it's itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn't a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 0000. I don't like it. I mean, these people are all almost 00 years old. and they are ORGNAME of ORGNAME - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms'. I definitely could not live like that. I don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it's a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 000 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 00 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates. BRRRR my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. I need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don't ever talk to them it's really a shame. I need to clean the water filter pitcher so I can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 0 glasses of coffee a day. I don't drink any caffeine. I did one day and I was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. I don't understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up?  on tv people always say lets go get coffee" or "we need some coffee" and it's always after some traumatic event or really late at night. I think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. I guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? I wonder why andy called this morning. I called him back twice and he didn't answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of "I am a. d. d. " doesn't really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. I would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. I wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 0/0 of a ". "  well I am going to end this the way I started it. it is really really very very cold in here. 
__label__label0 I am in my dorm room in jester west staring at the keyboard. my friend's dad just bought me a new dell computer because mine was so old that it would not recognize ethernet because the technology is too new. I am listening to an allman brothers band cd that I downloaded and it's pretty good. I don't know if I'm doing this right but I guess I am because I'm just typing what I'm thinking. I had to wake up at 0 this morning for a ta session for calculus which was of no help at all. she gave us the easiest problems ever and the class ran late so I had to walk into my biology class after it had started. it seems in math the teacher always explains things that are so easy and when u get to the homework u find that its nothing like class at all. I am noticing crumbs on my keyboard from the new flavor blasted goldfish extra cheddar I sampled some in the campus store and they were so good that I bought them. ok now it is getting hard to type bc I keep thinking too hard I think. I am now downloading the movie super troopers. the very first thing that I downloaded after getting my computer was the movie yellow submarine. I love having kazaa because I never have to buy cds or dvds ever again. I have an hour until my next class which just so happens to be psy. after that I think I am going shopping because my dad's wife just sent me 000 dollars for a graduation present. my sister is iming me right now. she had an away message about how mondays suck or something so I told her to think about pollyanna haha I thought it was funny. my roommate went outside to study because our room is like 00 degrees below zero at all times. I like my roommate but she is one of those overly caring people. I feel so bad saying anything mean about her though because it seems like I inconvenience her more than she does me. well maybe not I don't know. I thought that the university would match roommates according to their time schedules and interests. haha it was kind of funny because I was just assuming that my roommate was going to be a person who listened to the same kind of music that I do because that was one of the questions that you had to answer. well she does not and she only has like 0 cds and they are probably the worst ever, well maybe not but avril levine is one of them which indicates a total lack of good taste in music for her part. it always makes me wonder when people are really smart but they like dumb things like she has serendipity. I am a big john cusak fan but that movie was awful everything they said sounded so practiced and forced it was disappointing, and I probably spelled that wrong I can never remember if there are 0 s's of 0 ps and maybe there are 0 of both I don't know I guess ill look it up after I am finished with this. which I almost am I have less than one minute left woo hoo no I'm just kidding, this wasn't too bad and I got to practice my typing. I can type pretty fast but I look at the keyboard and I  
__label__label0 wow, this might be interesting. my hands are sticky. there's crap underneath my fingernails from cooking soup last night and so now every time I bite my fingers it tastes weird. I have boogers. jacob is a funny guy. I got nothing. my nose is really itchy. heh- itchy and scratchy, the simpsons, vicky likes that show a lot. I wonder why her cell phone keeps hanging up. my chin itches. that's better. man, I need to clean. the set up of those empty cans looks phallic. I need to take a shower before class. I wonder if this party will be fun. I can't believe I'm awake this early. I'm hungry. those croutons were good. I have the ending song of Ebichu stuck in my head. ok- 00 minutes is a long time. neil forgot his glasses. it's wayne's world wayne's world, party time, excellent. -guitar sounds-. ok boogers are getting on my nerves. my hand needed to be scratched. what's with all the itching? there goes my eyebrow. I should remember to use my mp0 player when I go to class. man I need to get my tags renewed. I almost spelt renewed wrong. miguel never called me back, the turd. I'm glad I got a job. I hope I enjoy working there. man, I can't wait for the matrix revisited to come out. I'm going to ask off work on that day. It might be neil's birthday. I don't know what I'm going to get him. hey my birthday is in like a week. haha, like a week, meatwad- miguel, jerk who didn't call but I love him anyway. god the floor's dirty. I wish the cat didn't knock crap over. I hate that feeling where you know there's a hair on you, but you can't find it, so it just keeps touching you and annoying the crap out of you. I should go laundry. jesus christ, that song isn't even in english- so why is it stuck in my head? this is kind of like a live journal- except cooler, because it's not all hey everyone read what I think but don't get mad or think I'm weird" I think those are pointless. I always thought a journal was private- but I guess I was wrong. "you got me all emotional, chu chu chu chu yeaaaaaaaaaaaah" damn song. man disneyland was hella fun. I hope I make it in life. otherwise. I just might get bored and do something I hate. I miss all my friends from the bluff. I've known them forever. also- they worshipped me. but mostly I miss being able to say, remember when jeremy fell out of his chair in third grade?! I like running into people I know. PROPNAME was so nice to walk me to class. I should call him sometime and see how his school is going. He is so sweet. Too many drugs, but sweet, and he has a good body. damn the hormones. and now the other eye brow itches, I need to tame these bad boys. haha- shake your tail feathers, asians shake it for jeet-san. niiiice. dude that asian guy was hot in jester. I wish I could suppress all that stupid physical crap. -yawn- I'm not tired, I think I'm just hungry. oh my god, 0 minutes left. YAY! neil should fix the computer, it looks ugly without it's case on. I'm going to wear my sexy jeans today and my ninja turtle shirt, only because they are both bad ass. I miss the old cartoon. I miss my childhood. I bet my mom's lonely. I wonder if she got rid of the ants. they were in attack mode. it was like a bad horror movie from years gone. the baby kitten is asleep. I love her, when she does not bite me. I need to work out. I want to have a killer body. I want someone to stop and look at me and go- jesus christ she is hot. too bad I look 00. I need to send my mom that grades thing. I do not know why. oh yeah the safe drivers insurance. OHHH I'm going to send her the tags thing too, yeah. I should call first. she might get mad if I just send that to her. I like popping my toes. oh lord here comes gavin. I knew I couldn't get through this without him talking to me. that's ok, I deserve it, I shouldn't lead the poor boy on, but what can I say, I like the attention. 00 secs. sweeeeeeeeet. 
__label__label0 Well, I guess I get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. I always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. Oh well, I guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. Man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. I can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since I've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. It's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. I've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. I'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. Hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should I finally start off with something healthy, I mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. That would sound good. I need to do something to keep my freshman 00 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers. This computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and I'm now slowly falling asleep. Aww man, I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. It shouldn't be too bad. I don't even know if I'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. It's not like this is an official paper, but since I'm a perfectionist I can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. I guess it only works on ORGNAME because it's just faster to type this way. I just realized that I get off track too easily, I may have some form of ADD. I can barely even listen to myself talk for 00 minutes. It's really hard when I'm face to face with someone. I just can't stand in one place for that long. So, I just zone out. as I'm doing now. I'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what I write. People sometimes think I'm drunk when I'm sending them mail, like when I sent a post card to a few friends back home while I was backpacking through LOCNAME this summer with my brother. Where is he by the way? Oh yeah, he went to work today. I live with him, I thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. I'd always want what he had and vice versa. So, when we were in LOCNAME, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. I guess the difference here is that . um I lost my track of thought, oh yeah, that we have separate rooms so we don't have to really see each other all the time. Just a moment, I need to change my posture. I'm becoming less attentive to myself. that's better. I wonder where my dog is, it's usually good to have him by my side. He is fluffy and fun to pet, well, at least he is there to substitute for my brother and keeps me company. That reminds me, I was supposed to walk him when I got home, but I haven't come around to doing that. I'll just go in 0 minutes when this is over. He can wait awhile. I wish I was a dog, he doesn't need anything but the occasional love, food, water, and he gets to sleep whenever he wants. I want to just take a while to lounge. I don't even get to do that much in the summer. I'm always active, either moving around, hanging out, or traveling. which I like a lot. Oh, I forgot to ask my adviser about the study abroad program. I'm a big language freak, in French at least, after I've finished learning that I want to do Italian and maybe Spanish. I'm slowly losing my Russian though, since my parents aren't there with me every evening to talk to. I need to move around a bit, my butt is getting sore from the chair. I need to get a new chair finally, this one just isn't doing it. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought, I wonder how much I've written already. It seems like my fingers haven't stopped moving for quite a while. It's a renewed sensation since I haven't played piano for a while. I need to finally get one of those too for my apartment. or else I'll forget how to do that too. It's weird how something you've done nearly your entire life can disappear so quickly. Yay, only a few more seconds left to write, 00 , 0, 0, 0, 0. Done 
__label__label1 I'm not quite sure what to write about, and I highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper! It makes me nervous to turn in a paper that I won't have time to proofread or check over. One of my English teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper! Luckily my teachers aren't like that and this is the first paper I've had to write so far. Which is a good thing, I'm definitely not complaining. It is also the first actual homework assignment I have had, the rest is just reading and reading and more reading! Luckily most of it is interesting. I know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework, but I don't think so. It isn't harder because there is more time to accomplish things in. the. Besides, teachers aren't so anal here. Maybe it's just UT, but I love it! I love the liberal attitude! Anyway, my roommate is due back at any second. Everytime I hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way, I think it is her. It's a bit distracting, although I guess in a way I already am distracted. I just don't know what to write about! I really hope this paper isn't graded on content! But PROPNAME, my roommate, is really nice. She thinks she is a witch, which I thought was incredibly weird, but whatever. I haven't seen anything weird since I've been here. Unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is. She did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met! Isn't that weird? I can't imagine that relationship going anywhere. But it makes me feel glad that I have PROPNAME. He is been my boyfriend for two years, and now that we are in different cities, it's hard! I think he is taking it harder than I am, but I don't know how to help him! I guess that if the situation was reversed, I would be freaking out too. It's just that I have so many things to do here, that I can't talk to him every single time he wants to. Maybe things will improve with time. I finally found the lyrics to PROPNAME's song called ?Only Time. ? It really has a great message, although almost all of her songs do. As the title implies, she talks about how only time knows everything. Time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away. Knowing that is great, it's just hard. Kind of like the saying ?easier said than done. ? It's hard waiting for things! Not material things necessarily, but for success and happiness and similar things. I guess that's what everyone wants; happiness. I'm scared that I won't find it in my future work. Even though I love helping people and I know Social Work is a great thing, social workers make less than $00,000 a year! It makes me wonder if I have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 00 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe PROPNAME's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! 
__label__label1 I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at LOCNAME because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to ORGNAME and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at LOCNAME so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 00 more sec. blah blah    00 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. 
__label__label0 As I look at this blank space, what am I going to write about?  There is no topic really, so I guess its up to me. I'm thinking about how I need to cancel my doctors appointment because the bug bites that have been on my leg for over two weeks are finally starting to go away. I have never been to the doctor at the ORGNAME. That also reminds me that I need to go give a list of my professors so that I can get extended time. This whole timed writing thing is fairly new to me. I have had extended time for a long time, so its never really been an issue for me. But I do like this writing assignment, its nice not to have any rules and to just follow my stream of consciousness. I mean we wrote stream of consciousness papers in high school, but never like this for an assignment. It amazes me how far technology has come. What did students do before the internet? I mean, look at what I'm doing right now, this is crazy. How did people function and know things without internet and email. I have basically grown up in a world that has always had computers. granted when I was really young not everyone had computers, but for as long as I have been of age to where the internet would benefit me, it has always been there. That also applies to cell phones. I simply do not understand how people would find one another and get a hold of each other without them. I am so dependent on mine. Oh no, I just looked down at my to do list and realized I really need to call my owl pal for this week, I have never really met her, and they told me she was special needs. " from what I have heard she is not really the sorority type, and well, neither am I in some ways, but I really hope I connect with her because I think she feels like an outsider. the pledge trainers said she would go sit off by herself and I am really sad for her because I know what its like to not really know anyone and be forced, almost, by family to be in a sorority. but I hope I can show her how neat it actually is. I hope that talking about music will be a bridge between us. but god, I hate the fact of having to do something. Being obliged to do something really annoys me and it makes me not want to do it at all. I think I have gotten worse about that over the years. Over the years, hah, I'm only 00. but then again, I look at kids in high school now and think they look so young, its crazy, its like once I left for college, I can no longer be categorized as another kid. Its kind of sad really, and ill miss those days of always living at home with my parents to take care of me and annoy me, but then again, there's always holidays and summer vacation. I really hope that I enjoy this class and that it is not just so tedious to do the work. Actually, when I was reading the book the other day, some of it actually interested me, and I'm so thankful for that, it is so difficult for me to pay attention to things if I'm not interested. I don't know if its like that with everyone, or particularly because I'm adhd, but if something doesn't engage me, even the slightest bit, it is tedious to force myself to focus on it. I really hope that I find something to do with my life that I love, because that would really help, hah, I'm sure everyone says that, but I really do hope that that happens. I'm not exactly the hardest worker, but I feel like I'm going to be alright somehow. Its not like I can just sit on my ass with a trust fund or anything, because I know my parents aren't going to pay for me after college, but I know that I'll be ok. I sometimes worry that I won't be able to give my kids the same opportunities that my parents gave me, and that might be hard, but I don't really want to have kids unless I am mature and financially stable. Bringing it back to summer vacation. this summer I lived at home and didn't really work, but that's besides the point. I just wanted to talk about how I went home and totally noticed how privileged my friends and I are. I don't think that some of them really get it because their parents sheltered them a great deal more than mine did, but I mean, my friends from high school are some rich, spoiled brats, and I knew that before, but it really fazed me this summer. Its sad to me that my friends don't really know what its like to not have money, and I shouldn't be talking, I spend so much money and it doesn't really matter, I'm going to really need to learn how to budget money when its my own. Or learn how to not buy useless shit that just makes the place all cluttered. I hope we get more assignments like this one because its nice to get stuff out on the table, and I have a feeling no one is really reading this, because that would be a pain in the ass to read all this text that 000 students wrote. I need to call a couple of my friends at other schools, but its such a pain in the ass, bc schedules are never the same and we always miss each other and its hard to keep up with people and impossible to know every detail, but for some of my friends that stuff doesn't really matter and I know we will always be friends when we are together, and for that I am very grateful. with one minute left, what I'm I going to talk about, I wonder if it stops letting me type, or if I have to exit myself, that's crazy how its up there ticking away the seconds. turns out this wasn't so bad, and I'm glad I got it done now, as opposed to tomorrow when I have no class. well, talk to you soon, times up. tootles          
__label__label1 Right now I'm thinking what I am going to write about. I am so tired and so ready for this weekend. I just worked four or five days straight and now I get the whole weekend off. So I am so excited, yet so exhausted. School is fun yet is hard to keep up with all the readings for every class all the time. I don't know if I doing anything right or not. If I actually understand what each class is going to be like or if I will succeed in every class. Tomorrow I have a full day off with only two classes and the rest of the evening to do whatever. FINALLY a night to do whatever I want to and enjoy the college life and atmosphere. Explore what ORGNAME has to offer. I need to talk to my teacher that I am an aide for by next Wednesday, when am I going to have time to talk to her throughout my busy schedule. All the books piling up on my bed. things I need to get done today or at least by this weekend so that I am caught up for classes next week. Finally next weekend I will be abl0e to go home. able to see all of my friends that I have not seen in probably 0 months. I am trying to be as quiet as possible so that my roommate can study and do whatever she is doing without me bothering her. I need to go shopping for some food for my dorm so that I actually have something to eat. Guess I'll probably go there tomorrow and find things that I will need and also eat. What am I going to do this weekend with all the stuff going on in austin. am I going to stay here or should I head back home? what should I do. Guess I'll see what I feel like this when this weekend comes. Gosh. I wish this time would be almost up so that I can get on to studying for my classes that I actually have tomorrow. I have so much to do yet so little time. Hmmmm. this pink lemonade that I made is kinda tangy, maybe needs some more water. I just feel like I have so much energy right now that I could do anything. I need to make some calls to the people I have not talked to in a while and just catch up on everything that is going on. my ffet are cold. guess I better go put on some socks. my ass is also getting kinda sore from sitting on this hard wooden chair that the dorms provide. I probably need to get a pillow so that I can sit here longer. dang my room also needs to be cleaned. it seems like the dust takes only a couple of seconds to land and make everything look dirty. the blue rug sure is starting to look sad. guess I need to go borrow the vacuum cleaner downstairs so that I can get it looking better. the room also feels like it is getting colder. I sure need to go shopping. sooon. but I have no money. I need to get some money from my parents. how I sure do miss having them around and having everything paid for. the room is so bland and plain. the green ugly tack board thing could use some decoration. I wish people wouldn't have to come see my room on Friday. maybe I won't be here when they come or maybe I might make it a point not to be here since at least my side looks pretty drab. my biology book is sure bigger sitting on the shelf than I realized. I sure need to catch up in that class since I really don't like biology. next friday when I get out of class I need to have my stuff packed up so right after I can head home. I can go visiting and then go to homecoming to see everyone. I don't think I will stay long, because I might feel awkward being in college and going to a high school football game. People might look at me weird. I don't like when people stare at me. I need to sign and fill out this form for my nursing class, it will be due pretty soon. I just don't feel like doing any of it. what should I do this weekend. Its so confusing. what should I do. Wow. I didn't realize all the room that I still have left on my shelves, I can still store a lot of more stuff on them. I sure have not played a game lately. I wish I could find someone that knows how to play dominoes, I really wan tot play dominoes with my brand new ones. I'm getting so bored, wandering around the room trying to think about other things that I need to get done, abll the stuff to do and so little amount of time to do it. 
__label__label1 this is my first writing assignment. I'm watching cosby on tv. I have a headache. I've had a headache most of today. I woke up and was still dead tired even after 0 hours of sleep. I had a stomach ache and felt like I was going to be sick. I had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so I got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good I think for breakfast. I think from now on on mwf I'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. I was supposed to have a study group tonight but I called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but I don't really need it. I think I'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. I had calculus in high school but got a 0 on the AP test so I'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since I'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. I was thinking about switching majors to psych cause I really enjoyed everything I learned in high school when I took it. I don't know if I'll switch over though yet. I'm liking me ee000 and 000 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day I've felt like crap and I miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since I've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 0 0/0 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. I'd come home every weekend if I had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. I'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. I don't care about the experience. I'm here to learn and I do that during the week. I do all my homework when I need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't I come home and spend my time with the one person I want to spend time with. well I know people here that have offered me rides so I can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause I spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on I'll get rides home from other people so I can spend my time with who I want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. I feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how I feel. I love my mom and everything, but I'm not really close to her at all, and I've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and I am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. I'm so close to mariko and I love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. I've been thinking about going next summer. I'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 0000 dollars for the ticket and I'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then I've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. I really want to go. my mom's really against the religion I've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and I hate how she feels. but through religion I've learned how to deal with all these feelings and I'm comforted now and I forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. I'm kind of tired and I still have a headache. I want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time I checked, and right now I don't want to walk back down there 0 floors to find out. I don't' feel like a sprite either, I could go down to san jac again. I think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. I need to move around more or something I guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and I can't stand it. I put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and I put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so I guess I won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but I don't think it matters. oh well. I have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. I like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. I miss her so much. I hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. I don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. I wish I could help her more but there's not much I can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason I want to be home still. so I can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and I call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 000 or church or school during the day and then I have classes at certain times so I can't just leave and call her. but I'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so I don't think I'll get a couple calls in this week. I'll call on the weekend though since I won't be going home this weekend. hopefully I meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. I seem to be the youngest person there. and I'm already not a talkative person, so I think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 00 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well. 
__label__label0 I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -000 to a 000 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  
__label__label1 hmmm. I was wondering what I was going to think when I was planning to do the assignment. well, I can hear that tv. married with children. I thought they were off the air. this place feels a little cold. its friday what am I going to do today?   sharon's or cullens place for sure. maybe downtown. hmmm. I have a paper to write my monday. I might want to get some sleep tonight and get a good start on it sat. its only two pages though. I better do a good job though. I have to read un redeemed captive this week to. I better thry and finish it sunday. I'm getting hungry. mexican food. taco C. hmmm. I might take a nap today. I want to work out today. I want to gain 00lbs before christmas. I need to work on my jump shot too. I miss playing ball everyday like I used to growing up. I'll go out to eat with eva at the texas club tonight then go play ball followed by working out. after that I'll be free for the rest of the night and be ready to party. I need to run a couple of miles to. I wondering how often you have to run in order to loose body fat. I wonder how long it would take me to get to 0%. 0 months? I'd have to eat right though. I wonder what it would take to walk on the Ut men's b-ball team. I guess I'd have to email someone and ask permission to play on the practice squad and go from there. hmmm. that would be great to work my way up there. if PROPNAME could do it then I could do it . huge maybe but I'd have to commit myself. kinda like when I grew up playing everyday. I like this root beer. A&W never fails to make great drinks. Amys ice cream sounds good too. I wonder what my room mates are doing tonight. sean is probably staying home and doing nothing and cullen might be getting together with some of his friends from back in high school. I want to go to killeen this weekend but I have way to much work to knock out. I miss my lil brother PROPNAME and sis caroline. I'll drive up there to see them as soon as possible. I wonder how my uncle joe is doing. I can't believe that him and emily are getting a divorce. they're only 00 and they have been married for 0 yrs and they seem right for each other. just goes to show what can happen to two people. you never know . dang that really bites because I hate to see my family break up. reminds me of my parents. and my dad. I wonder when the new lutheran service is. I need to get back into going to church. I belong there and I haven't found a church perfect for me in atx yet. I liked hyde baptist collegiate service. I'm not baptist though. anyways. I can't believe I'm going to be 00 in like 0 months. its more of a right of passage then anything. I still won't drink in public so its not that big of a deal but I always imagined 00 being in your 00s and a legal adult. I don't feel 00 though. that always seemed old to me. I don't think I have much time left on the writing assignment. hmmm. shrimp at the clubhouse tonight! I think I'm going to take  eva up on her offer and go with her and her family. 
__label__label1 Right now, I am thinking about my chemistry homework and test. I am very nervous about it and I am worried that I may not succeed to my fullest potential. I am also very nervous and anxious about doing this writing assignment because I have never done this before. I'm also listening to music because it helps me to relax. I am cold and sometimes in makes it difficult to concentrate because my attention is focused on my coldness. I pretty much just look around the room every single day and it helps me to think things through. I also think about the things I have done wrong in my life and how it is that I can go back and correct them. There is this person I love so much with my entire heart, but I don't like him hanging around my best friend. Wait, its more like I don't like for her to hang around him. Yesterday, she just freaked me out because she just came up to us, my friends and I, and she just leaned on my boyfriend. What kind of a friend is she to do that? She knows that I hate for her to be around my boyfriend. And every time she is around him I end up getting mad at him, when, in reality, I should be getting mad at her. There are so many things I want to tell her, but I'm afraid I'll end up hurting her, but I feel she needs to know that it does hurt me a lot when I see her flirting with my boyfriend. She has always been boy crazy, its just that people don't know that. Every time she is around him I get this ugly feeling in my tummy like there is something very wrong. And then today just out of nowhere I told her that she needed to find herself a man, a companion that she could spend time with and stay away from me and my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't say that, but its true. I have always been very insecure about myself, but my boyfriend always tells me that I am beautiful and that he loves me very much. I truly believe him and in my heart that we love each other. Its just my best friend somehow interferes. I figure is she keeps on doing that I am going to let her know how I feel because I don't want to keep my feeling all bottled up inside of me. First of all, I have never been able to deal with my feelings so I pretty much just kept them bottled up inside. I don't know why I did that but I did, up until the time I started going out with my boyfriend. He changed me and the way I felt about myself and I cherish that because he has made a huge impact in my life. I love him so dearly. Anyways, enough about that. I talked to my dad about an hour ago. I call him every day, twice a day in fact. I am what you call Daddy's Little Girl!" I am very proud to say that because I love my father very much. He has done so much for me and I wish there was a way that I could give something back. The thing is I used to be able to tell my dad everything, but then something changed. I stopped telling certain things. I guess he kind of saw me as something I wasn't and that made me very sad. In fact, I'm getting teary-eyed right now. It's like my father had this whole other image of the daughter he wanted. I tried to tell him that I was different, but he just wouldn't understand. And now that I am over here at college its like, I wish I could take back every bad thing I did to him. I want to tell him everything that has happened in my life, some good things and some bad. I want him to know all the obstacles and temptations that I have encountered throughout the past few years. I feel he needs to know what his daughter has gone through in her life. A few days ago when I talked to him, I felt homesick. When I hung up with him, I started crying. I poured my heart out right in front of my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend everything about how I wanted to have a better relationship with my father. I want to let him know that I love him so much and that I appreciate him for everything he has done for me. I also miss my mom because she has always done things for me and taught me different things. She is special to me because of who she is. I love her dearly. I miss my little brother and older brother too. I also miss my dog and my cat. They are like my children. They are growing up without their mommy and that makes me sad. I want to be there for them. I love my dad, mom, brothers and boyfriend. I hope they know that they mean a lot to me and that I am lucky to have them as a part of my life. 
__label__label0 Today is September 00th. I was reading some articles on ORGNAME. com about whether or not we should commemorate this. I had a class at 0:00--I wish I didn't have to wake up for this class. It seems like whenever I have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy. I'm glad that the only other class I have is in the afternoon today. Speaking of which I'm going home for the weekend--that makes me happy because I will get away from everything related to ORGNAME ORGNAME. My roommate was in the room, he just left. I am writing on my laptop--it's very hard to use this keyboard. I am tired right now. I don't know what to do. I have calculus homework to do. I feel like it has been looming over my head. I can't wait to go to home. I feel more comfortable here at LOCNAME now. I think I'm getting along with everyone. I don't feel stressed out anymore. I feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about. I will find what I like to do here. I might join the badminton club. That sounds like fun because I used to play badminton and now I don't anymore. I don't play it anymore because I don't feel like it. Being at ORGNAME is a lot of walking, I'm tired cause of it. I think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when I'm typing. I am LOCNAMEn. My parents are from India. They are very nice people and they are at home. Sometimes I feel like they miss me and I miss them. I am going back to see them. I am getting tired of typing on the keyboard. I think I am a smart person. I wonder if other people think I try to act smart. I don't really care if they do. I'm just being myself. I get along with others. I don't think I will be completely satisfied in life thinking I have to be something when I grow up. I should just stay happy as I am right now. I think that would be a good life plan. Just take it easy. That's what I'm doing right now. My computer is a ORGNAME and it's a laptop--with a small keyboard. I got it new. My roommate just came in. He is doing the laundry. I feel like he feels that he has a lot to do. It seems to me he likes to work. I am going to keep my life simple here at college. I won't expect myself to be a superhero. I think waking up for class is good because then the day doesn't go by. In college you have a lot of free-time. I think I spend too much time studying ineffectively. I should set good goals and then spend time making friends. I am very happy right now. I feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up. I have to get up to get the trash. Whenever I do work, I think of doing it in sequences. Sometimes I act smart. It's okay--I like to make intellectual jokes a lot. My parents used to take the trash from my room when I was young. They did a lot of things for me. Now I have to do a lot of things on my own. That's okay--we're almost out of milk. I'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so I can just throw them away after using it. I'm getting hungry. My roommate is eating Spaghetti from downstairs. That tastes good. Am I being artificial?  Am I talking as if I want people to hear what exactly I'm saying. I don't now. bye     
__label__label0 Well, first I'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever been given. I'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom I'm very in love with, but I really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. My roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. Which is what I am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that I have to do!  I think that if I can just do that then I will be able to keep with all ORGNAME my work and get grades in my classes that I will approve. I also need to get into the college of communications so therefore I HAVE to keep my grades up. I really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, I'm very excited about that. Also, God willing I really do think it would be awesome to go to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME for their graduate program in speech pathology. They have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if I'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus!  Ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and I'm sure whoever reads this is going think that I am a weirdo, but I really don't have much else to talk about. Hmmm. I am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family!  I think we will have a lot of fun and I'm excited that I get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. I'm having loss of words at the moment. And someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on!  Ok I did. lets get back on track here. I'M curious as to who gets to read these because I bet that would be a lot of fun. I'm sure that there are LOTS of different things said on each persons assignment. Gosh only 0 minutes of typing! Is this ever going to end!  (hey I'm being honesty here!)  I bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than I am, but I really am typing my thoughts and feelings. Actually I'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making NO sense at all. I think that sitting here and typing out what I'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what I would really be thinking about, because I'm trying to find something to think about that I can type about. Wow that was a confusing sentence. I'm surprised at how much fun I'm having here. I honestly thought that I would become homesick and miss everything back home and I also thought I would miss ryan a lot more than I am. I mean I do miss him, yes!  But there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things. Not complaining because I'm glad I'm not sitting around moping about him, I need to enjoy life, especially college life!  I really can't wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls. The girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you, but I'm sure if I was a guy I probably would not mind. Sitting here wondering what I'm going to type next. I'm not supposed to be planning anything out, which I'm not, but sometimes I just don't think about anything. I don't always have to have something on my mind do I?  Much less a feeling". feelings are sometimes so over-rated. Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 00 minutes. Well I just re-read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought, so I had to type it. Ok 0 more minutes to go, I'm almost there!  Gee I didn't realize how often I just don't think about stuff, but I usually do think a lot about different things, I guess just not now. I consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker, and have more mature thoughts than other people that I know. Take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm "yeah theta!". very loud, annoying, and obnoxious. Yes these are the people I am living with, sweet girls but nothing like me. I don't get into all the sorority stuff. Times running out. whoo hoo!  Now I can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment. which is, I must say the easiest graded assignment I have ever done!  So I think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this. Good idea huh?  Now I can think about is how I want this to end. I have about a minute to go. So I will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and I hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and "feelings" for 00 minutes of my life. Sorry if I bored you, which I probably did. but its ok, I'm really not a boring person!  Well have a good day and goodbye!  
__label__label0 how to begin, I have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now I'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why I feel this is a strange assignment o well I don't smell much right now but I hear the tv which I fixed last night I did a pretty good job even though I still have an extra screw left I'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which I hate its 0 00 tonight I'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum I'm glad I get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow I'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the competition will become harder the band is a neat experience I have always liked marching and now I get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun I have only been typing for 0 minutes this is going to be a long 00 minutes there is nothing I can do to make it go by quicker even if I type slower, no I'm trying to find something else to think about, so I am disrupting my stream which is ironic that I have not really because I'm on a new one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end . until now. so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so I can start my weekend and maybe get some food I'm very hungry now  I have not eaten all day and I'm hungry now I need to get some food, maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely seems like that and cafeteria food is all I eat lately its not a very good realization drew just walked in the door he is my roommate he just asked how I watch scooby doo its so mundane" he uses vocabulary to impress people and I just wrote it in my paper to impress people. very ironic as well john ridder died today he is the star on threes company and 0 simple rules and he died on set suddenly its a weird thing I would like to live a long life and maybe die suddenly tho and not have to know I'm dying although I'm not afraid to die I feel I have a place to go though, my afterlife is set many people here don't believe in God and I don't know why it seems to me to be the only answer we have not even figured out the human brain and we dare to declare that there is no being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that can't stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways I have been trying to help people understand that PROPNAME came to give love and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live I guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what I believe is imposing my culture on them which I guess could be true but I'm not trying to break them from their traditions I'm just trying to . my roommate just started talking, "arafat refuses to leave, and the LOCNAME is blatantly pro-israel. "no, if the us was blatantly pro-israel world war three begins. I stopped following the conversation with california governors my roommates friend is here now and they are arguing politics, current affairs, the such, . scooby doo caught the bad guy, I'm satisfied now, man my fingers hurt and this writing is getting very tiring I wish I could be done now but I have to keep writing they are talking about proposition 00 now bla bla its very hard to concentrate on two things at once but I guess that is what college is about my physics homework is next to me I'm very glad I am understanding most of it I was proud of myself today because I finished most of my hw which is due next monday we have an exam in two weeks and I think I will do very well I also have an exam in this class and I'm very not prepared hopefully I can sit down and read through the text we will have to have read thus far and begin to see what this class will teach me I also remember that I have to do some experiment hours for this class hopefully I will have some free time in the weekend ahead to do some of them  I am beginning to smell food man I am so hungry I'm not thinking about much now because I am so focused on how hungry I am and what I would like to eat yet I'm thinking about thinking about what I want to eat and so forth. this assignment is very weird because you can't have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think about it the point is gone, the twilight zone is on now I love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 00 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues of the time in them which is very good, I like them, I have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert myself, its weird how humans always need diversion and now when I can't even write my thoughts I have to divert myself by talking about diversion man I can't wait to see what heaven has to offer, soon enough, only 00 seconds left now I can't wait till heaven its almost here three two one z         
__label__label0 Sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing. There's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 00 minutes and try and make it completely coherent. The music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling. Then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue. Adversaries in between as if rapids in the path. The sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky. Now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest. The light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside. I watch my friends sit next to me. One is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm, the other sits and types quietly. The music is quieter now with bell like rings in it. The bass has a slow but progressive sound to it. The guitar sings about as the music moves on. Over the middle window, the one with the blinds shut, we keep the blue mask. It has sharp looking teeth which are yellow. The teeth match the horns. I'm now half past the time of when I started. Some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs. Sorry for the time of which I slacked. I loosing ideas of what to write now. I have little more to to tell of my surroundings more. The music is now more of a popping sounds. It also mud     like sounding guitar now. My phone is ringing now but I got my friend to pick it up. I will call them back. This is now the end. 
__label__label0 As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 00 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK0) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at PROPNAME. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough. I have sympathy for them. I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK0 gives me a headache. I probably will never wear CK0 again. I hope all my friends and family are doing well. I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye. 
__label__label1 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I forgot my code I'm really sorry my roommate wants to know what this paper is about I answered "stream of conscious no I'm thinking you dumbass and damn that tool in the background sounds awesome.

__label__label1 clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it. - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it. hmmmm its 00* degrees celcius right now. that does not even really matter, I prob. won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something. spike tv. what kinda dumb sh** is this. this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv" - 00 minutes is a long time to be typing. I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are. better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out. is that possible. yeah. school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point. I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico. I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was. where do all these "personal type surveys" going. is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools. if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid. hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions. I think that job would be pretty boring. I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy. that is prob. why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing. I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity. that would suck. it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was "mentally handicapped". I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else. its crazy to be alive and conscious. consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation. joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy. I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. I can't really think of what to say. I need a cigarette to calm me down. that is not even how you spell "cigarette" but spelling is not even that important. I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar. but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled. that kinda shit pisses me off. need a smoke. 
__label__label1 Well, I have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so I guess I should start working on it now. It's a thursday afternoon and all I'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. What a life! These stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. Let's see, I've been up here for about a month now, and I have yet been able to see and fun" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. It's not that I want to be partying everyday, still I would like to see what's all the fuss's about. Then again, my life here at the apartment is great. I live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them I would be bored out of my mind. These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. I'm hungry, yet I don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? Of course not! It's because I have to sit here for 00 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. During the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to UT, so during the day they're at the campus. Maybe I should spend more time at the campus. Maybe that would help me get to know more people. I haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that I see in class everyday, those that I greet with a casual hello; however, I don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. My computer desk keeps on shaking while I'm typing this, I should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? This place is so cramped. Luckily, this weekend I'm going back home to LOCNAME to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. I miss my family very much, especially my dad. He have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. Now, I have to be on my own, that's the only way that I will learn to grow up. I know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what I'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how I'm doing in school, wondering how late I sleep, wondering how many times I eat in a day, etc. I know he worries, but the best I can do is call him every night just to let him know that I'm doing fine. I can't go back home, if I live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then I will never learn to grow up. I miss my mom too, but I'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. The buses hear run pretty frequently, I just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. My roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. I'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. My other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. It's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. Oh yea, ORGNAME meeting is today, maybe I will get to know more people. Then again, I doubt it because I'm always quiet and reserved so I guess I won't talk much. Well, I'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. After this, I'm going to head to class, then it's ORGNAME meeting. 
__label__label1 My first week at ORGNAME has been okay despite the humid weather, long walks to class, and lack of sleep. Already I am behind on most of my reading assignments. My math homework which is due Sunday is incredibly hard. Other than that, I have met new people and taken part in new experiences. For example I have never shared any of my stuff with anyone. But when I came to ORGNAME, I must share everything, including a dorm room, ethernet cable, printer, etc. with my friends, roommate, strangers, etc. Life here is so different. There are so many types of people and the population of economics and psychology are overwhelming to me. The size of those classes is just a little smaller than my graduating class in high school. Another problem is that I must force myself to wake up in the mornings and walk to class. Right now my roommate is asleep which I am busily doing my homework and yet I am still behind. I can even hear her snore. Sometimes this is very distracting to me; however, you must learn to cope with these dilemmas. I have never understood why I chose to come LOCNAME. I have realized that getting into the business program is not that important because I am not the only one that got in. I guess I came here because my friends did. They influenced me that going to UT was cheaper than if I went out of state to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I took their advice, although sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision. Last night, some of my friends tried to convince me to attend a frat party. I knew she was never like this in LOCNAME. I knew she was curious about what it was like, but everyone should know what to expect at one of these parties. I am glad I didn't go. I am feeling overwhelmed, scattered, and tired right now. I hear noises of people doing laundry, the air conditioner, the stupid building fans that are spinning below my dorm, etc. The lighting in here is horrible because I don't want to turn on the light in case it would wake up my roommate. Although I am somewhat considerate of others like my roommate, are they considerate of me?  I always clean up my messes, but she hardly ever does. For example if my hair is left in the bathtub, I always wash them down the drain and when water splashes out from the sink I clean it up, but will she do the same for me. I guess not since her hair is always laying around in the sink and her items take up most of the tub and sink area. Well, I guess this is what it is like living with another person. I tend to complain a lot about things. Maybe I do this because I am stressed out or really mad at something. Sometimes on these assignments it is really hard to describe what you are feeling. When I was given this assignment in high school psychology, we had a certain word amount that had to be obtained. So I used ands and ums as additional words. Twenty minutes is actually a long time to write such an assignment. I am still thinking about what to write. There are so many things I need to finish. One for example is my calculus homework. So as my twenty minutes is about to end, I hope UT will bring me many great memories. 
__label__label1 I'm really tired of studying. I hope this doesn't take long. Man I want some water. Will this thing know if I leave? I sure wish PROPNAME would call. I miss her so much. Or maybe I want PROPNAME to call. Or PROPNAME. Or PROPNAME. Who do I want to call? Too many girls, this school is going to get me into trouble. I hope I get all my homework done tonight. So I can have a social life this weekend. It would be nice to relax for once. Not have to carry a book everywhere. I felt so stupid reading at the football game at halftime. But we have so much work. I'm just not used to this. I'll get it done, I have to. I need to get a 0. 0 this year. So I can get into that damn business school. Why does it have to be so hard? I see stupid people all the time who are business majors. I'm smart, why can't they let me in? PROPNAME, its only been five and half minutes? This is going to take forever. Lets see what other h. w I have. Summary of the readings, due tomorrow. Catch up on chapters in Art History. Take a nap. yea right. I wish I knew what sleep was. And I have to go see PROPNAME tonight. Hopefully that is a cool symbol. I wonder who is going to read this? I'm sorry your having to read this. We must be very boring people. I hope you get what your looking for. I sure wish I was in your position, then I wouldn't have to sturdy so damn much for this class. I don't understand DR. PROPNAME at all. I enjoy listening, but as I write, I fail to comprehend. And as I comprehend, I fail to write it down. Which is more important? And the text book. Ohh My God. The most interesting part, was the story about the black guy getting shot by the cops on page 0. At least it had a little drama. Like on TV. Damn I wonder what is on TV right now. 0:00. I don't have a clue. Not used to the channels down here yet. And ohhh wait, I wouldn't have time to watch TV anyway, with all the work. Damn, I'm thirsty. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I almost killed him for setting off that alarm on his truck in the middle of the night. Well not really, but I was upset. I need my sleep. I don't have time to be jumping out of bed, to see why there are blaring horns. I need to learn how to spell. I'm retarded. I need sleep. Damn A Nap Sounds Good. 0 more minutes until Nap time. yea right. 0 more minutes until I read some more. Why has no one called me. I know PROPNAME won't call. God forbid you call your ex boyfriend back. What we can't be friends? I miss her so much too. PROPNAME is perfect. but PROPNAME was perfect for me. No one treated me better then her. Too bad she is 0 hours away. but worth the drive. At least its not 0 states like PROPNAME. Won't be seeing her any time soon. I want to go see her so bad though. I know she needs me to be there for her. She is so fragile right now. PROPNAME will be ok. But I really need her to be there for me. Or maybe I just need someone to be there. I can't stand this being alone. Girls only want one thing here. to not have a boyfriend. Just have fun, 00-0. I miss having a real girlfriend. PROPNAME made me so happy. I want that so bad. PROPNAME can't be that for me unless I move. I got to figure this shit out. damn did I write all this. I have issues. whooaaa hoooaaaa. I wonder if there are any parties this weekend. I wish I could go. But Ill probably just hear about them next week. Ohh well, Back to studying. Bye Bye reader. Until Next Time I love that symbol. 
__label__label1 I wonder if I still have time to turn in my books to get a full refund. if I can't then its going to be pretty bad. I'm definitely not going to type correct grammar and punctuation on this paper. I mean does my brain think in grammar. nope. its thinks how I talk. PROPNAMEs song is really loud on his computer right now. I remember that I used to hate this song when I first heard it but now its good. I really don't want to read my chemistry chapter. think about kumchev. his class is pointless to go to because you can't understand what he is trying to say. I keep on seeing the time counting at the top of the screen but I'm trying not to look at it. its probably inevitable though. if you see something like that and you tell yourself not to look at it its basically guaranteed. that is a funny word. why is there weird spellings in words. this guitar part in this song is really crazy right now. I'm trying so hard no to look at the timer. its killing me. what a fun game this is. ok time to change songs. I wonder what the heck jackie thinks about me. I wish she would just open up and not hold back. what the heck is she so afraid of. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really crazy looking. I hope I don't fall asleep in art today. this is an awesome assignment. I love this crap. I used to do this in english when we were supposed to be writing rough drafts for papers. why do teachers monitor kids work in class. what if I don't want to do it in class. mrs waggoner was the worst ever. what the heck was her problem. I love this guitar part right here. I wonder what song is playing on joels computer right now. I think it might be the counting crows or somebody like that. I think I might go insane trying not to look at the clock up top. I wonder how much time has passed. probably like three minutes. ok I was just drumming on the space bar. I love drumming. playing the ir guitar is probably the best though. it looks awesome when you see people that are playing it as they are walking. its funny. I just like how many crazy people there are here in austin. I just want to become a rockstar. and I really want to go surfing with jackie right now. what a cool chick. that matchless amp really didn't sound that good now that I think about it. I would go fender twin all the way. that carbon fiber guitar was awesome and so was that acoustic amp. I really need to get my guitar fixed. haha. we play in like two weeks and I don't have one that works. I love thinkin about that. I wonder what I'm going to do. there is no use worrying about it though. it will all work out. I don't understand why people worry. the odds are that you what you worry about will be ok. and even if something really bad happens you don't think that you will be able to deal with it. but it you will so why worry at all. I think my mom is the biggest worrier that I have ever met. I don't see how she could waste her life doing it. wooaahh. a duck noise just came on my computer. I remember fred. he was a cool duck. I had a duck in my dream the other night. how random is that. I wish I was telepathic. how awesome would that be. that would be the best ever. I wonder how much time has passed now. its really crazy trying not to look at the clock. I wonder if I should run tonight. I probably need too. this is one of the best solos I have ever heard. I wonder if joel is going to work out tonight. I hope so because I want to run but I can't make myself if someone does not go with me. queen is a weird band. I wonder what songs our dj next class. that would be a fun job. I think it would be funny to play some crazy songs on. I wish that I could do really crazy stuff in class. like throw books at people. I don't want to hurt em but think about how funny it would be to see some just lose it. and like fart really loud when everything is quiet. I think that would the ultimate. I wonder what I made on my calculus quiz. probably a hundred because I'm a genius. 
__label__label1 I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing PROPNAME's "Hot in LOCNAME". The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it. My desktop died on me while I was up at LOCNAME and I am shopping for a new computer. The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it. But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 00 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it. All in all, life on the computer side just sucks. I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in LOCNAME until tomorrow when I go back to LOCNAME for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend. But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in LOCNAME, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises. I have late classes on ORGNAME and I don't get up until like 00, but I still am awakened by construction at 00 or so. Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck. He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him. He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do. So that is cool. It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers. So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on ORGNAME, like I am writing to my best friends. When I get back to LOCNAME, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at ORGNAME, into my freshman year. But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT. 
__label__label0 Well, I'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that I know I have to do this. Just got back from school and had lunch. My whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. I cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. I've left the TV on. I always like to watch something as I eat. Something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. It's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. I've always wondered about the concept of time. How it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. I have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. I'm not getting old so much as I had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. Headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. I was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to PROPNAME PROPNAME to do some shopping. My boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. What a nasty shock!. At least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. I left the TV on way too loud. Funny how I sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others I love background noises. Leave the TV on just for "company". Talk about true desperation. CSI is on. Love the show. Absolutely fascinating. I am such a TV addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. Got an exam coming up on Monday, got to start studying for that. Hope it's not too tough. Gosh, I really miss home and family. It's tough being away in a foreign land. I can't wait to get back to LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I am so looking forward to my trip in LOCNAME at the end of the year. I am so excited about LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. It was hot out today. I'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. The ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. I'm glad I missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. Like winter so much better. I'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in LOCNAME. Have to admit that I don't really know what else to talk about. I just know that I want to shower after this but knowing me, I'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the CSI marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so I can continue the moving process. My new apartment needs a lot of TLC before it will be in tip top shape. Then again, only about three more months till I leave the states and am back on the road to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME then LOCNAME. This year has been a most trying one. But I know that I am a stronger and wiser person for it. I've been through so much in life, but I know there's so much more. I'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in ORGNAME before I leave and a family friend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. Maybe I won't need/want that fan after all. There's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. I am almost there, just 0 more minutes left. I really need to focus my time and attention on what I'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. I'm actually speaking as I type. Is that normal? Or more precisely, that's normal for me. I wonder what Professor PROPNAME would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. Ok. back to CSI. 
__label__label1 It's amazing how much free time you have in college. A totally different experience from when I was in my grade school years. Grade school, seems like I was in the 0th grade. It's hard to believe that my high school years were actually my grade school years as well and now I'm in a place of 00,000 people where you're lucky if 00 people know who you are. But with all this free time, it's hard to fill it with stuff to do all the time. Naps are a great way of filling up lots of hours, but you can only sleep so much. I remember laying in bed last night and having a feeling of homesickness even though I only live 00 minutes away and can go home with the push of seven digits. I feel bad for the people who are from small towns a million miles away. Not only are they far from home, but being thrown into the fire that is ORGNAME and surviving is a difficult task for anyone, let alone coming from towns 0/00 the size of LOCNAME. But I've been enjoying my college experience so far. Being able to sleep late, wake up late, take 0 hour naps, all of it. Not having to sit in a classroom for an hour and half every other day is a major plus as well. Come to think of it, I have no idea how I sat through those days and actually was focused for its entirety. The Xbox is calling my name as I write, taunting me with glimpses of football and shooting. It's amazing how people think that video games are responsible for their child being violent and whatnot. Parents are blaming a series of circuits and programs as the reason their kid is messed up?  If people were being better parents, these kids would have better things to do than rot their brains in front of a TV screen. In today's world of money money and more money, it's hard to find time to put aside what is quite important in the world and spending time with the people that matter most. Not that TV's bad. Heck, I watch way too much of it myself, but my parents also ingrained in me the difference between right and wrong and I was lucky enough to be born right before the start of the technological age, so I get the best of what the world has to offered right now but had my values and beliefs ingrained in me before this ever-growingly corrupt world took over. Growingly, is that a word?  It's hard to write for twenty minutes straight without going off on a tangent and starting to focus on other things, like the PROPNAME's cup sitting in front of my desk that's been sitting there for a few days and is probably starting to be a safe haven for mold. Speaking of which, there is also a box of fajita toppings that have been sitting in our refrigerator since school started, and yet even though I remember, I still don't get off my butt and throw it out. I keep telling myself that I'll do it when I actually take out the trash but heck, we only take the trash out like, once a week. I remember doing a stream of consciousness writing as one of my creative works in high school for a book we read because I thought that stream of consciousness writings would be really simple. Heck, you just write whatever comes to your head. Not too hard right?  But man, I think I've grown up in a very rigidly structured school system and always have to plan stuff out before I actually start writing. So I found myself doing more thinking than writing, trying to find the right words and grammar usages so that my "paper" wouldn't sound like a first grader wrote it. But sometimes that's what a stream of consciousness writing has to be. It doesn't matter if you use fifty letter words or "big," because these writings aren't about the content, they're about collecting your thoughts and putting them down no matter how random they be. I found it funny how when you gave out this assignment and asked if there were any questions, 00 hands shot up in the air. Questions arose like, how many paragraphs? How many words?  What's the structure?  We grow up in a world of rules, where everything is set out before us and we either follow or be considered a problem child. We spend more time defining the box rather than thinking outside it. Heck, we rarely even spend time thinking inside of it. My dad's friend is starting this school in which they let kids pretty much do whatever they want. They provide guidance but not rules, set boundaries but don't fence the kids in. Their objective is to let the kid develop his or her own self-discipline, not letting some adult develop it for him or her so that when they get out into the real world, they don't curl up into a little ball and hide or rebel and go crazy and not know what they're doing. While I think it's a pretty cool idea, others reject the fact that a school like this exists because people are ingrained with rules, their lives governed by the boundaries of the box. So hopefully, someday, people will be able to think for themselves, that we won't become robots that only exist because God told us we could exist at the time that we do exist. 
__label__label0 Today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? It's only the 0th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. I stepped off of the 0th floor elevator at Jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. It's awful. I've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. I wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool I guess. I got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. I'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. This oatmeal cream pie is great, I'm so hungry because I haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. I hate when I don't know everything. well I don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. I hate when I can't understand something right away, probably because I know that means I have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. I swear that when I used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. I wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now I'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when I used to eat them years ago. Who knows? or actually who cares. PROPNAME just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means I'm going to the chem. review at 0. It'll probably be really good for me so I shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. I can't believe that I'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but I kind of feel like I'm missing out on so much in LOCNAME LOCNAME, even though I'm not. I can't wait to get some good Mexican food. it's been too long. What a horrible affect working at a Mexican restaurant all summer had on me. Oh well. The football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! I'm so excited, my first UT football games as a STUDENT in the STUDENT section. ha-ha. and actually I think my 0rd or 0th game ever to see, how cool. I saw something on LOCNAME's news talking about ordering the games on PPV. that's crazy. I really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and I can't watch them. like the away games for example. That'd be so cool if I could get tickets to the OU game. I hear that there's nothing like it, and I'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 00 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but I guess if all else fails I can order ir PPV for 00 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on ORGNAME or something. I actually called PROPNAME today, after my first Biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. I don't know why but for some reason I really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before I went down to LOCNAME LOCNAME this past weekend. it's cool I guess. since I'm here and he's there, but I don't know. I wish that we wouldn't of met, so that I wouldn't have to deal with it. But then again I don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. I wish that I could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that I wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. I like that boy. dang I just admitted it. I don't like him actually. I just don't know. I definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy "PROPNAME" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. Sounds like a challenge. I'm pretty hungry for like some real food, I guess I'll go down to JCL in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and I'm exceptionally tired too. I ended up being 0 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and I don't think it even helped me that much since I barely got a B on the homework. Man, I miss high school math classes. Everything was definitely explained SO much better, so yeah needless to say I'm pretty freaked out about that, I'm actually freaked out about all my classes. Oh well. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm writing about the things I am thinking of. I just got my hair cut and now I'm drinking a coke float. which I probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 00 is a big thing these days. my boyfriend just called and I like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes I just wonder like if I'm doing the right thing. actually I wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived. now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 00 years - that's a long time. I'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents. today I went and bought some clothes, which I probably should not have because I have a lot already. this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this. today we had a parade in my home town. yeah I'm home again. and it was cool. PROPNAME is a senior. I wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie. today is the football game, I wonder if LOCNAME will win. ORGNAME lost really bad last night - LOCNAME their not as good as they think they are. mom is sleeping and she snores a lot. dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting. coolcherrychick has just signed on. cool. lol wow my hair is really short. man I can type faster than I thought I could, I guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! I can't believe I found pants long enough for me at ORGNAME, that like never happens because I have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal. now coolcherrychick has just signed off. why do I like coke so much? I mean I don't drink it that often because I don't allow myself to, but I do enjoy it a lot - I guess the caffeine. I have problems spelling. this coke float is super good. thank god he stopped. ha-ha I just wrote stuffed before I erased it, anyway with the window. my hair is really cute, at least I think so. for once I'm not cold, its amazing. rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least I will have a coach forcing me to work out and I can identify with a team. I wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, I mean I can use big words, but I really don't think in big words. my cognate. however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that. I hope rhea's oh regina's home, I hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, I don't think she really tried very hard but I mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible. regina and laurie just got home and as I'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something I don't know and I feel bad but I have to do this assignment. oh well I hope they didn't think I was being rude. this is kind of hard because I think so much faster than I type. mija just ran with laurie. she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but I guess I do to when I don't take a bath for awhile. I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it. PROPNAME called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 00 something but looks a lot younger. like 00 or 00 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general. I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer. I like that song and I can't believe a 00 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself. PROPNAME is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it. I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it. I mean I can jump high, but I can't hit hard. wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, I am glad I am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow I really have problems typing. today I changed in the car, that was really not fun I should have planned it better. oh well I guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking. usa wow I'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices. shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time. it would be so nice to be rich. I need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol. breathing is a good thing. laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun. my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.    
__label__label1 Well, I'm 00 years old now and I'm in college. So far it has been kind of boring really and I still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything. Ok not everything but it's not a good thing and wow 00 minutes is a long time. I want to watch this show on television but  I guess I won't so let's see what else I am thinking. The dryer is kind of loud and only 0 minutes have passed since I've been typing nonsense. School is also exhausting. I take naps like everyday and you know I actually like writing about nothing because why?  Hmm. Well, because I'm not stuck with a certain topic and I just have to decide what to write about. I would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense. However, about 0 hour ago I was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now I'm hungry again because I didn't have much to eat. So I'm thinking of going to ORGNAME and getting some delicious Mocha Frappucino. Is that spelt with 0 or 0 "c's". Anyways before I go to ORGNAME I may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at ORGNAME because I may still have other assignments to attend to and UT is too far of a distance. Man I wonder what time ORGNAME is closed. I also want some ice cream. I sure hope that I don't gain the Freshman 00 because that would really suck. I hope that doesn't offend whomever has to read this because I didn't mean to. I sure hope that I learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually. My throat or something hurts and I wish that I could just sleep all day. I hate some of my classes and I hate being in the Gateway Program. It's alright but not what I expected. I definitely didn't expect to take a class for that program but I am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms. I feel like what am I doing there and can I get out of the program without hurting the Coordinator?  Also, when should I try to get out of the program?  0 more minutes to go. what to talk about? what to talk about?  Oh yeah, I had a fever last week and I hope that I don't get sick again this year. Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life. I definitely don't know what to do. They like helped me register or whatever and I have to wait 0 hours and 00 minutes on MWF before my last class on those days which is Psychology and I have no idea what to do during that time and I tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class. Sorry. 0 more minutes. I'm looking at this sheet and I have no idea what to do with my UT email address and how to get into it. Does that make me dumb?  I wonder if I'm even going to get a response for that question. yeah 0 more seconds.  
__label__label1 So today has been one of the worst days ever. I found out that I didn't do that great on my biology exam 0. and I aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 0. I have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and I am still not done with it. I am hungry too. I haven't had dinner tonight. Well not yet. so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now. This is crazy. I don't know what to write. Its hard to write for 00 minute. it has only been 0 minute. This is crazy. I wonder how long I will get to use this computer. Oh, I don't know if my class code is right or not, but I think that's what it is. So we will see. I hope This is the right one. Who knows. I have no idea what to write. I don't even know what I am suppose to write. I am really hungry. Why wouldn't this Prescreening Survey thing work? This is very frustrating. I feel like crying now. Oh gosh the thing worked and I want to get it over with but I can't stop writing. I wish I had started writing earlier. I think what I just wrote didn't make any sense. No I am pretty sure it didn't make any sense. I think it doesn't matter. I realized that u think faster then you type. well at least I do. May be because I type slow. But who knows. I think everyone thinks faster then they type. Anyways, so I want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but I can't. So I wonder what PROPNAME is doing this weekend. I  have to study this weekend , because I am really behind. I make a lot of typing error. I have to improve my typing. I want to go to JCL and eat. Then again I don't want to go by myself. I wonder if PROPNAME would come. She probably would. PROPNAME needs to come get her book. I kind of feel obligated, but I don't want to call. It's her book and she should care for it. She should call me. Besides no one ever calls me other than PROPNAME. PROPNAME is a very nice  girl and I want to be good friend with her, but she  is always too busy with her high school friends. They are nice too. Why is it only 00 minute. It needs to be 00 minute already. I wonder what PROPNAME wrote for her writing assignment. OK so this is not a great assignment. I mean its very simple. It's very easy, but it is kind of annoying. It's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself. I mean you are writing for the class. Who knows. this is getting old. Actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast. PROPNAME was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies. Now that's crazy. Well   now I am hungry again. This is not great. This is actually kind of annoying. I think I wrote this line twice. I am not sure. Like the way I am not sure about my class code. I know I am right but its kind of hard to agree with it. Ok so I don't make any sense again. See I am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy. I know he is not going to read this but what if he does? He is going to think I am idiot. Why am I like this? I don't get it. no I am really annoying. I can tell. but oh well. I am who I am. People should deal with it. See now I don't make sense again I don't even know why I thought about those stuff. and wrote it here. I can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating. Except that there is nothing to cheat about. You will be cheating yourself. yay. only two minutes left. No it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast. I need to stop chatting on the internet. I can't even write a sentence properly. Internet does no good to you. well at least not to me. Ok I guess this is it then. only 00 sec left. yay. I guess I will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one. this is crazy. but ik  
__label__label1 Well, this assignment is interesting. I don't think I have ever attempted to write for 00 minutes straight. I wonder if I have ADHD or ADD or if its just because I am a drummer. Wow! I have only gone for a minute and I am already bored. Um. I was watching the Cowboy game and they won 00-00. Vinyl did well but threw an interception. I think he will be good this year as lond as he doesn't get hurt. He has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses. Speaking of defenses (I doubt this has any relation) but anyways I didn't make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing. I really wanted to make it and thought that I had a decent chance. Maybe I gave myself too much credit. Maybe I am not big enough or something. I wish I could have made it but I suppose that one was up to the coach and God. Speaking of God (random again) I went to a really neat church last Sunday. Its name is Glad Tidings. It is an assembly of God Church (although I am Lutheran I think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons). I miss my old church though. My youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend. I am unsure if I should go home this weekend. I don't know. I think I will stay here because I really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend. I am really tired tonight but I suppose I will do my best to continue typing the entire 00 minutes. But along the thought of the laundry business. I have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend (was going to do this weekend but I think I can make it until then). It has been really hot lately. It was brutal last Saturday trying to run in the morning. It was so humid. It eventually rained but not until after the practice. I have never been so sore in my life. I am still sore but I guess it doesn't matter seeing as I am not going to be playing for the team. I suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe I will try and keep in shape. I don't know though. We will see. Well I am half-way there. I am still tired and I am finding this assignment very boring and I suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring. Kind of sad I suppose. I wish I weren't so lonely tonight. Just me and the TV. A horrible invention it is. Ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals. But I suppose it helps many escape. I like to escape by playing video games. I think I might play one in a few minutes when I get done with this thing. But yaw. I really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on it but it is really fun and entertaining. I am still tired. Still tired but only about 0 minutes to go! Hurray! This makes me excited. I didn't have an antecedent before the "this" nor did I there but that was because I quoted the previous mistake. I wonder who just walked by my room. It sounded like two girls. I wonder if there really is a girl out there for me. Probably. I hope so. One can only hope can't one? It's funny, I accidentally made a typo and said can't none which if one thought about it logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about it from a LOCNAME perspective it would have the opposite negative and depressing effect. I hope for the logical. I heard a Papa PROPNAME's commercial. I wonder how they can claim they have "better ingredients, or better pizza?" It is subjective I would think. There is another weather report on TV. I find it interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them (I usually just go with the flow). The flow of the easy river I guess. It is 00 o'clock. Only a minute left. Here's my chance to say something deep. I really can't think of anything but live the Golden rule and you will find yourself a better person. Love is all you need as PROPNAME said (the Beatle of course. Lol). That's it! 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 00 minutes. But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy PROPNAME was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put "so anyways" instead of "so anyway" I think that sounds as dumb as "laters" when one really means "later". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. Within reason that is. so anyway. I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted. I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. I am so proud of myself lately. I am being such a good girl. Although my habit of exercising everyday at 0 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at PROPNAME's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway. I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. I'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. I have been developing such good habits. I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early. O shit. I just got a little flash of procrastination. That sneaky devil. NO GO AWAY!!!. I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. I just don't have the time for that. I run every day . Mon-thurs. 0 miles a day. plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. Damn that dinner. UGH. What else do I do. O yea. I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too. I haven't been drinking. I haven't been too flakey. With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. Anyway we are good terms at the present. I'm being a pretty good daughter. I finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. I want to write about something cool. No luck. I really want to join the p0 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes. Bad flutes in lol. I'm probably really bad by now. I wonder if there is practice rooms around. I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. And then I would act all shy and innocent. It's just how I act. Natural reflex to wanted attention. Sometimes I think I'm so stupid. And then they would flatter me and ask me out. And I would act like I wasn't really sure. I little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you. 
__label__label1 I just clicked the go button for this writing assignment for psychology and I just almost misspelled psychology. It is amazing how I can't spell psychology and how I still stumble on spelling it on the keyboard, psychology, I just did it again. At the beginning and before this page there was a precautionary note that said if people were insecure about their confidentiality. It is just an assignment, what could possibly go wrong. The teacher or TA will steal your identity! If they do they some students should sue. That is weird. I can't believe I just wrote that. I am writing this assignment now because I have some spare time and the writing assignment is due on Friday. I do not even know when I would have done this assignment. I have free time because my computer science class was, I guess canceled. I hope it was canceled because I hate missing class. It feels as if I am missing some knowledge that is necessary for my brain. I hate when I am unsure if class is actually canceled. Added to that, I hate when people are still in class sitting in the room waiting for class to start. Those students make me uncomfortable because it seems as if they know (they don't) that we actually have class. I am in the computer lab typing this writing assignment and I do not know what else to write about. Let's think. I am thinking. Okay, I am in the corner, near corner of the computer lab and I am typing. Oh yeah, speaking of writing assignments, my architecture writing assignment is going to be difficult because my TA wants us or prefers that we use LOCNAME style in our papers. When he asked us if anyone did not know how to use LOCNAME everyone was quiet and a huge pregnant pause was present. It is weird that teachers still do not understand that if students are quiet when they ask a question, nobody knows the answer. It is weird. I am now thinking if I am even doing this assignment correctly. It seems as if I am "tracking my thoughts" of this past week. I hope I still get credit for this class. I don't even know this class is hard or easy yet. Maybe I should reply that girl who mass emailed everyone and say that we should start a study group. A study group would hopefully help me learn more about this subject. I hope I can pass this class because as much as it is interesting I don't think I can sit through more of the same demos or demonstrations. The experimental requirement is pretty cool. I am almost done and I am happy about that. I don't have to write a 0 page research paper. Yeah!  Writing research papers can be a hassle. Calculus is progressing fast and I am sort of surprised that I am grasping the notes real well. I am understanding Calculus, weird. Even though it is my major I still think that I should be able to be better than what I have been doing for that class. Thirteen minutes and whatever seconds, is how long I have been typing so far. This is sort of getting tiring. I wonder how psychologists interpret this writings. I can't wait to read what the explanation for this writing assignment is. I think it would be cool if one of our tests was just writing this kind of stuff. "Write what is on you Mind for 00 minutes". That would be weird. It would be a completion test grade, which would be cool. I think I have 0 more minutes,  and it is weird that I said 'think' because I can not subtract and I am a math major. Well my calculus professor said that he has problems with simple arithmetic also so I am not that worried. It always reassures me that teachers/professors have the ability to forgot simple things like that. It makes myself better. I can't wait for this timer to be over. I am waiting and I am just typing stuff down. I have 0 minutes left so when I am done with this minute I will have 00 seconds left. So, yeah. Time is dwindling down. I wonder how many people are doing this assignment right as I am doing this assignment. What will I do after this. Oh yeah I have to read for my next class. Wait! I have to read for this class. I can't believe I for got, I need to read for this class after my music class. 
__label__label0 this is raechal collins. my feelings are good right now. I think I am going home this weekend for the first time since I've been up here. I don't know if it is for sure yet, but I'm excited to see everyone that I haven't seen in a while. my roommate is in a bad mood because she found out her ex boyfriend is dating a junior in high school which is just gross. also, one of my best friends from high school isn't very happy. I don't know why but she just doesn't seem happy. my absolute best friend in the world is coming down this weekend though so I might be staying in LOCNAME for that. I just want to go home to see my boyfriend, or whatever it could be considered. I'm waiting for him to write me back right now. even though I can't really write him back because I'm writing on this thing for twenty minutes. I'm excited about this class. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. it's by far my most interesting one, next to swimming. I'm excited for that one cause it will be a good form of exercise and I need a way to get some exercise up here. since all I seem to be doing is eating. I wonder how everything is back home. it's really hard to do the long distance thing, but its weird how they say time apart can make the heart grow fonder, when all it has done to me is make me grow more detached. in a way, I guess it is good, but at the same time, it's kind of sad, because if I was home right now, everything would be the same, and we would be together. except now I'm here and I need to branch out and meet new people. I'm also doing this sorority business and I really don't know if it's meant for me. I like it, but I mean it seems like its just girls who join a group to get "sisters for life" and I don't know if it is something I want to spend all my time and parent's money doing. I never realized how much things coasted until I came here. it is absolutely insane. now I have to actually keep track of my money and its so hard. I had no idea how much I spent a month. I hate my anthropology class. it's hard and I don't understand what's going on in there. also my teacher is blind which is really cool and respectable but its almost distracting because I find myself staring at his guide dog or wondering what he's feeling since he is standing in front of a class of 000 plus and he can't see them. for all he knows we could be throwing stuff leaving class eating drinking and being absent. my friend is being shady and trying to rub in getting her third choice sorority when my other friend got first. it is weird. we have to figure out where I am living next year. it is kind of stressful because every body knows where they are living and I don't have a clue cause I haven't thought about it once. tomorrow night I am going to the ato pledge line. it should be fun a lot of my guy friends went ato so I like hanging out with them. I like my roommate jen. she is a badass and we all have fun. I also like PROPNAME, my other roommate. actually they are both my suite mates my roommate is PROPNAME from high school. it made it easier moving in and stuff with a roommate I already knew. I would have hated moving in a finding that my roommate was someone who didn't speak English or like hated life or something like that. this twenty minutes is lasting longer than I thought. I didn't expect to write this much. PROPNAME and PROPNAME is playing in my room right now, and I love this movie. I haven't seen it in forever either. I remember when it first game out I was obsessed with PROPNAME deception. now in real life, he is not at hot as he used to be. he just killed himself in the movie. the ending of the movie/play is very depressing, and my arms and wrists are starting to hurt with all this typing. I need to pick out an outfit to wear to the ato thing tomorrow night. I guess I'm supposed to wear a cocktail dress. I don't want to get all dressed up. I've done enough dressing up for the past week during rush. welp, the twenty minutes is over, it was nice talking to you computer. 
__label__label1 Well I am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering I hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. Too bad that I have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study I will be leading for kappa that I have little time to rest I really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because I have so much going on that I feel guilty if I am not always being productive. I know that I need to take time every day just to sit with God and tell him what is going on in my mind. So that's what I want to do with this exercise I am going to type everything I think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to God. I hate that I feel like I constantly need to be watching my money, or what I eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like I am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? I know I human, and that I am sinful and that I can't do anything on my own. So I don't know why I get disappointed in my failures, why should I expect anything else??? I feel pretty guilty about how much time I put into some of my relationships as well, like I wish I was there for Lauren F. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. Please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. I also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, I need you to make me aware of when I start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when I start to keep a constant tab on how much I spend or what people owe me. Lord I want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something I deserve because I know that I do not!   I also know that I need to take a nap this afternoon if I want to get any work done later so I pray that I would be able to do that as well. I have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. YOU and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. Lord I want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. I feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when I can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. I really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  I hate that I was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, I am also so worried about PROPNAME, MP, and PROPNAME, I just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you Lord, and understand your love for them. I wish I knew what to expect on this PHL test coming up on Thursday, but there I go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. I am worried that I am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as I should be but I know that I am doing the best I can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. I am so glad I got to spend time with ford this weekend and I really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in LOCNAME because I know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. But I know he was supposed to be here this weekend and I am so glad that he got to talk to PROPNAME last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. I feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason I am really upset that the tuna fish I bought and that 0up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $0???? come on PROPNAME you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly I am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but I know that I need to be really giving that to you and I really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. I am really hot so I had to go turn on the fan. I wonder when becca and PROPNAME are getting back, is it wrong that I kind of like that they aren't around right now? Why is it that I like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? I am kind of worried about PROPNAME maybe liking me, I really don't want him to, because I really love having him as a friend and I really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason I've been getting that vibe lately so I really hope that I can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. Man that 0up stuff I got is disgusting!!! why do I always try those things. Healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. I really hate that I am always feeling like I need to be repaid when I do something for someone I mean seriously! why can't I just give out of love and show like grace like PROPNAME did to us??? I am really excited about this PSYCH class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. I am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 00 hours of sleep I got on Saturday I really need to get rest because I know I don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! I just wish I would enjoy it I pray that I could have a peace so that I could sleep right now. 
__label__label1      This is kind of new and interesting. I have never done my homework like this before. I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment. Psychology is such an interesting field to study. It is my major in fact at this moment. I don't know if I will change though. The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder. With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything. I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer. I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together. I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. A dark haired man just sat near me. He didn't sit at the computer directly near me. I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really. People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway. For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. He wasn't very charming. That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't. He really isn't my type. He is in the business school. Ehh. I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'. Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money. People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner. I was that poor. I think it is because of this, I tend to value education. I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. That to me  
__label__label1      I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, "yeah I party", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 0 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 0th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about "friends" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch "joey" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, PROPNAME, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 00, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the "brady bunch" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 0000. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 00th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 00th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 0th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 00 or 00, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  PROPNAME. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 0  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later 
__label__label1      I hate walking all over the place at this school. My calves are going to double in size and they already don't fit into boots When I jumped horses I had to buy custom made boots so that my calves could fit into them. My mom has big calves too. Maybe it runs in the family. I don't really now anything else about calves. Weird thing to talk about probably, but mine really hurt right now beacuse of all the walking. It seems like everyplace I have to go is all the way across c ampus. Oh well. walking will probably be good for me. Maybe with all the walking I could loose some weight and make my ex-boyfriend wish that he didn't break up with me. Maybe I'll dye my hair red too. He'd like that. Ha Ha Ha. I think my hair would look good red. I think I should dye it but I hear a lot of people say don't do it. I think I should. Sonce I'm so pale I would like to have some depth. I feel like my blonde hair washes me out. I feel like I'm PROPNAME. Short choppy sentences merely stating what's going on around him. His short choppy sentences had deep meaning though. I wonder if my sentences have any deep meaning. Probably not since I have been talking about calves and hair. So it goes. I think about a lot of things. Sometimes I think so much that I can't fall asleep at night. When that happens I spray some stuff that smell like lavender on my pillows and fall right asleep. Lavender smells so good. I also like that color. It might be my favorite. I don't know because I like really deep eggplant. Yeah. Eggplant it pretty, not a very good looking vegetalbe however. Good color bad vegetable. They don't taste very good either. I don't like many vegetables. I like good that makes you fat. It just tastes better. My mom always yells at me when I eat fatting food. Sometimes when I just eat I get look. I miss my mom. I miss my car. I wish I could go get in my car and blare the stereo and smoke. That would be great. It really gets all the stress out. I love doing that. I miss my car. I also miss my cats, my friends, my ex. When I see happy couples I want to throw rocks at them. I don't but it frustrates me when I see how happy I used to be with another person, but in someone else. Then I start to think of him and I get sad. Oh good this is almost over this was harder than I thought. Trying to type really slows down your thinking. But perhaps I am just a slow typer. I probably should have learned how to properly type when I was a kid. I just didn't think it was important then. They should have a service like maids who come to your house and type stuff for you. Another thing I wish I would have done is learn to play an instrament. There is something so refined about a woman who can play an instrament. There is also something very attractive about a guy who can play something, guitar, piano and whatnot. Very cool. Maybe beacuse they seem more sensative. That is very important. Oh good 00 seconds Yeah!! I have so much more to do tonight. 
__label__label1      Well, this is interesting. Let's see. right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really. PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more. studious than what I'm doing. But I don't mind. Let's see. my hands have been smelling kind of funny. Like rust, almost. But I haven't touched anything rusty. Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves. Other than that, I don't really smell anything. God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now. I really want to eat. I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now. But no, I have to be a "conformist" and go when all my other friends are going. Now I have to pay for my food. And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying. Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience. I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum. Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room. We had it set at level 0, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk. Man, that was weird. I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps. The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 0, and their food is fine. Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination. Anyway. what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy. Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it. No, not that kind of sleepy. It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms. Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness. Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today. I'm so proud of my productivity today. After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my ORGNAME application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework. That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes. I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron. Whoa. Sometimes I think I work too hard. I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of. Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes. Man, I need to spit out this gum. It's like I'm chewing rubber or something. And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten. I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more. Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying. They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology. Here's the funniest one: "penia" means abnormal reduction. So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha. I can't help it, I'm still immature. Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it. But you must admit, that's a good way to remember "penia", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term. Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning. Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at ORGNAME. Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today. I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend. Let's see. six more minutes. Sorry, but I am counting down. Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent. I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy. Yes, petty jealousy. Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human. But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that. Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window. Did you know that dogs sleep about 00 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury. Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury. I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm. Or perhaps they were already warm. who knows. I definitely don't. Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time. I need to go to sleep. But no, it's only six in the evening. Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here. Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. and dream. I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams. Or maybe I don't want that. Who knows what would turn up. 
__label__label0      I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet. It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do. I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. I've never felt so busy in my life. Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out LOCNAME, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about. It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary. We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be. At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus. Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation. It was a great detour. Wow, 00 minutes is a long time, I just realized that. I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. So yea, back to the stressed out business. I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 0 at a community college, then I went to PROPNAME, LOCNAME to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. I worked and got paid. Good stuff. A few days after I got home from PROPNAME, I made my way to LOCNAME. My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. And I think we all know how busy things are around here. I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken. For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 00, the weekend before classes start. This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful. And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people. Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and the reception is in LOCNAME a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in LOCNAME, followed by who knows how long of being in LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME. My home is in LOCNAME, a little town of pop. 00,000 in LOCNAME LOCNAME, just two hours north of LOCNAME, 0 hours south of LOCNAME, and four hours east of LOCNAME. Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. I guess we'll see. Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.        
__label__label1      I am finally taking a break from doing my math homework. I am so excited to finally be doing nothing. I am so excited that I finally got my laundry back because now I do not have to worry about it, but I do need to do a load of some personal items. While looking around my room I see my side pretty neat and then I look at my roommate's side and it is a pig-sty. It bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere, when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed. Maybe we will have a talk about that later?  Who knows. But I cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend, but that's one more day that I don't have to go to class. I love living here at Towers but the walls are paper thin. I can hear anything and everything that my roommate/suitmate say and sometimes that's okay but when I'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me. Oh well, life could be worse. I wonder what else I have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow?  I think I need to go to PROPNAME's room at some point to get her notes from Philosophy that I missed last week, and I really need to go return a book to the Co-Op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad's name on it. Why would they do such a thing?  Oh well at least it won't be too hard to fix. At least I hope it won't be too hard to fix. I am so tired but I got so much sleep last night and I don't understand how I'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today? It makes no sense to me. Maybe I am still transforming into the "college-life-style" and I'm just not used to it yet?  I'm getting very sleepy but there's no point in trying to take a nap because I know it won't happen for me. I love how I have so many pictures around my room because everywhere I look I am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home. Speaking of home, I feel like so many people are going home this weekend. As much as I would like to go home, I don't think I'm quite ready to leave here yet. I don't think I'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already. Even if I did go home my parents wouldn't be there because they are going to the lake. I wonder if I will see them at all since they'll be so close to me now?  Maybe I will call them later and ask. Oh and I need to call PROPNAME back since she left me a message yesterday. I'll call her later when I have a few minutes to spare since I know the conversation will last for a lifetime. Or I guess I should say it will last for a long time. It's amazing how I was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and I'm left alone again in quietness. I will most definitely take advantage of that alone/quiet time, but then again sometimes I do get bored sitting here by myself. They asked me if I wanted to go eat with them but I just ate a few hours ago, I might as well save my meals for when I'm actually hungry right?  Wow, looking up at the clock I never realized how long twenty minutes really is. I feel almost out of breath because I've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes. My  sister just called but I have to call her back. She didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend PROPNAME would be searching for PROPNAME's car anyway. So I wonder what happened to it?  Did she park somewhere and forget where she left it?  Weird. I hope I never do that. Although it would probably be hard for me to do that since I've only driven my car twice in two weeks. I wonder if that's bad for it?  Maybe I need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works?  I should probably ask my dad about that. So its only four oclock in the afternoon and I feel like its ten at night. Why is that?  Well I just hope I keep up with everything as much as I'm "supposed" to because college is definitely not like high school. High school is like a joke compared to what I've experienced in only 0 days. Oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks. So about winter break. I cannot wait to go home because I think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again. I'm sure Ill see most of my friends over Thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the "old gang" will probably be Christmas break. That will be a fun break, and I know it will be great seeing everyone again. I wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip?  Hmmm there's another thing I need to check into because I don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute. Especially since my best friend who lives in LOCNAME will be in LOCNAME for part of the break. If I missed her because I was on a family trip I would be extremely upset so I need to figure it out to make sure I will be around. Wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe I should go get some coffee from downstairs? Sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it's kind of of sore. I think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather. I can't wait to fully recooperate so I can feel 000% again. Then hopefully I will be in a better mood and not so irritable?  Hopefully!  Well now getting back to the matter at hand, this assignment. ALthough it has been time consuming, it's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life. Wow and that's saying a lot!!!  I am so interested to see what our next assignment is like, since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again. Our class is huge and I actually saw a second person that I know yesterday when I was walking out. Speaking of I should probably call that friend of mine. Well it looks to me that I just glanced up and this assignment is over! Yay :-) 
__label__label0      it is often very cold in the Fac the smurf lab especially they call it the smurf lab because it's a student microcomputer facility the acronym and its meaning both absurdly out of date. the computers are new and black the keys crunching crisply under my sore and tired fingers sore and tired from a 0 hour lab drawing three dimensional models in a computer, changing materials, trying to get travertine to stick to cool, airy software. a man comes in (a boy a man) and sits at the computer I usually use but couldn't because his stuff was there. he pulls a sandwich out of a bag, readjusts his hat, takes a slow bite of the sandwich and gets back to work chewing and biting calmly and contentedly as if preparing for a long night which will require nourishment of a complete sort. complete nourishment completed with a drink of some brownish liquid like all other brownish liquids we drink as humans nearly indiscriminately. 0 minutes four minutes of aching arms and hands nerve cells firing the table to my brain, the itch on my right cheek to my brain, the cool air of the place to my brain. I love to write. I love to think in written form, to read the words in my brain, to think nothing but print if I can manage it. Not just in a case like this as if I ever had a case like this - but in all of my life, my every day. My speaking to others has quotation marks around it, descriptive ways of describing what I describe. I always want to write discribe and I don't think I ever have until now because always my mind ( the silent one, the one that doesn't think in word sounds or print) my silent mind stops my hand and puts an e there because it's right, because I knew that from the beginning but the part of my brain that lives in kindergarten, brown bear brown bear what do you see? - tells me so. No it tells me iiiii iii aye aye aye eye eye eye but it's eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I live in an apartment on my own now I can barely get it out of my head because it was so beautiful when I moved in  bare clean white bright new and beautiful and I keep it so clean and I love that about the apartment and I love that about me. I love to keep it all perfect. any one in the world could walk in the door and other than my messy grammar of any one's and every thing's there would be nothing out of place. I could open the door to the world and there is nothing shameful lying about no dirty plates and cups no clothes on the floor no mess around the sink. It's all clean as I'd like my life to be and am so gradually making it. The separation of church and state - the separation of method and emotion. Somehow I now think of star trek - oh, vulcans. Those crazy vulcans. I loved the next generation but I could never stomach any of the other iterations- the other shows in the series. The next generation was so right - picard so venerable, so rarely stooping to kirks weaknesses or the others' stupidities. So french, so proud. they made this archae not anthropological finding of some skull of some ancient form of man (in real life, not star trek) and they goyt got some graduate student or artist or pro or whatever to make a cast and then cover it with skin and eyes and hair to recreate the face of ancient man and it accidently turned out to look like patrick stewart and everyone thought hey ancient man looked like patrick stewart and they said no it didn't it's just a mistake but it was a great funny mistake anyway. I think a lot about william and henry james. I just read portrait of a lady over the summer and then to read ab out william in the psych book was so great so great to think that brothers could accomplish noteriety in separate fields to think that greatness was inherited from their father but they still so outshone him. my father has a software company and employs a man named john stewart which I think of because of patrick. He (john) drives a brand new red car red what corvette that's it. a red corvette so new that at the corvette show they didn't have one and paid him to put it on display. did they pay him?  my ear itches. They used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me. The boy in the chair I usually sit in is thinking about me because I see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye. He eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine. so close to done and I loved doing this because I never write anymore. s 
__label__label0      Ok, I'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I've been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of PROPNAME's mind. I hope that no one reads this seriously at all. Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. That was fast, I'm telling you this is a waste of time and I'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. I'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. I miss my wife. Yeah that's right my wife. We aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do. I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously. I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. Now I'll write about pizza hut. They got this buffet that's only 0. 00, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this. I love my wife so much. I miss her terribly. There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will. How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth. But since I couldn't choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information. I am a Catholic. This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven. Bad people go to hell. Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs. But wait, the plot thickens. I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. I am almost always right in this aspect. Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. I am not proud of all that I've done in my life. The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. One of the worst days of my life. There is no reason I can use to explain my actions. But I did it to end the relationship. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Good job huh?  Well she didn't want to leave anyway. At least that was what I thought. I was so damn confused. I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend. And I did. I disgraced myself and I hate. Er hated myself for it. I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. I don't know if I'm wrong. But I could be. Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. Now I'm listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME. The little known writer of some of the best music I've ever heard. I think he's great. It's kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but I do. I also like this guy PROPNAME PROPNAME a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. I love the way I can relate to it. I recently read "A streetcar named desire". The female role of blanche. She is like my ex. She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they "want"  NEVER tell me what I want. Only I know that and I don't appreciate being told. If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them. I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok. You. For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life. Both times by a girlfriends family. I have an extraordinarily pale complexion. The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican. Heh what can I say. 
__label__label0      Right now I am sitting here. The washing machine is very loud. My nose is  really stuffy. I really like that band brandston that I saw the othernight. they were  really nice and really cool. I can't wait until I get to hang out with steven. I really  missed him while I was in austin. stupid nose itches. I don't understand why randi  and I seem to not be as close anymore. Its kind of sad. She has been my best  friend for 0 years. Its really ironic that steven is now my best friend. who would  have ever thought? "Don't come crying back to me. When you're lonely and all out  of love" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly  causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific  song. Its a very nice song. Very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting. I  can't believe that I still have 00 minutes left to type. Its usually very hard for me to  type stream of consciousnes, I've tried it before in a humanities class for some  reason. I can't ever seem to really put what I'm thinking on paper. that's why its  hard for me to write or keep a journal. I even lie to myself on paper. I wonder why. I also wonder why PROPNAME is the way he is with me. I can't believe I ran into him last  night. He completely ignored me. That really hurts my feelings because we were  really close. At least I thought so. I really need closure. I hate myself for not  hating him. My nose is running again now. It's getting in the way of my typing. I  am so stressed out right now about biology. The house is completely silent right  now except for the washing machine. The dorm is never this quiet. I think maybe  that's why I like the dorm. Because its loud. Ow, I just hit my ear that I just pierced. Its really sore. The pain only lasts for a split second though. Its not as hot here in  amarillo as it is in austin. the weather here for labor day is perfect. I think I will go  and walk my dogs. I just sneezed again. I am sick of sneezing. Stupid allergies. I  need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework. I also need to read  chapters 0 and 0 for psychology. I am behind. I am so worried about my  biology. I don't understand it and because of that I am not focusing as hard on my  other classes. However, government should be easy. I've taken that class before. Psychology is fun, but I really do not know what to expect on my tests. I don't know  how I will do in that class. I thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy  at all. someone is getting ice from the refrigerator. I can hear it. wow, does my  mind really jump this much?  that's really interesting. I guess I am sort of truly  typing in a stream of consciencous. am I even spelling that right?  I usually can  spell. I feel like everyone else at LOCNAME is smarter than I am. I am not used to that.  I'm always the smartest. No one here knows my reputation. no one knows that I  am smart. But maybe I'm not smart. Maybe I am just lucky. My little puppy shinobi  isn't eating anymore. Maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday. I really  missed my dogs. zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me. He licked me  all over. I love dogs so much. but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't  show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people. other dogs like me  more. just my luck. I had to explain what I am doing to my mom. this is all  interesting. the fan is on now. my legs are cold. I think I'm sick. I want to listen to  my new cd again. I can't believe that I got to talk to further seems forever and get  put on the guest list for another show of theirs. too bad I didn't go. I can't believe  mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them. oh well, he is probably just  tying to be "emo" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with  the people  that he holds up on a pedestool. why did I ever date a guy like that?  and why am I still so attracted to such a stupid jerk?  I hate people like him. why  has he changed?  my stomach is hurting now again. I don't like being sick. I need  paper in order to print. and a USB cable. I hate that my printer doesn't work in my  dorm. I brought it for nothing. I bought some new cartridge too. its all a waste. I  can't return it. well for thanksgiving or something I will bring the printer home and  have my dad try to fix it. being home doesn't feel like home really. just feels like I'm  visiting. which is really what I'm doing. my nose is itching again, I think I am going  to sneeze again. I feel like I've been typing for 0 hours. someone just opened  something. I don't hear my dogs anymore. I wonder what they are doing. my  stomach is still hurting. the air conditioner just turned on. I heard it. I don't usually  hear these things. that's strange. my eyes are drooping. I'm tired. I haven't slept  well for a couple days. Why does he hate me?  I really wish I would just be brave  and confront him. I always say I'm going to, and I really think that I am going to, but  then I chicken out and if anything, I am extremely nice to him only to have him  ignore me. further seems forever was so good the other night. the energy  around me at the concert was so good. I was up in front. that was great. the new  lead singer was great. I need to go to more places like that in austin. I just typed  that sentence with my eyes closed. I am really falling asleep. my parents are  talking. I can hear them. my dad is selling my car. that makes me sad because I  really like my car. Even though I am getting a better car. 
__label__label1      I'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. Everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. I keep asking myself whether or not I'm am going to make it in my major. My major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. My friends say they don't know what I got myself into, but I keep telling them I'll be fine to not worry about me. When I say this I am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that I will be fine. This library is all to silent I think I just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. While I'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not I am going to make an A on the chemistry exam on Tuesday. I feel bombarded with chem and I don't know if I am going to be able to remember all three chapters. My mind keeps telling me that I will be fine that I just have to get used to it. High School was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. That hasnt been my problem lately the only problems I have had all are about having not enough time. Every time I talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, I tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. I know older people had told me the same but I really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. Oh yeah I am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. I feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. I feel like they all grasp the ideas that I don't. In high school I was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. Maybe that's just me overthinking. I can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. It smells like a piece of chocolate. Maybe it is a candybar of some sort. I don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. I am not a real big fan chocolate but I do love chocolate ice cream. Something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. Lately I have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. I miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. SHe is graduating a semester early from HS and is going to move to austin and attend ACC for the remainder of the year. I offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. I hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. Her father moved from italy to LOCNAME in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. The man now owns a 00 million dollar business that he started from nothing. He now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. All she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. She is one of the most ungrateful people I have ever encountered in my whole entire life. People who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but I see the real her everyday. 
__label__label0      I just opened iTunes and chose to play PROPNAME PROPNAME's album called "A Tribute to Jack PROPNAMEson". The first song "Right Off" begins with a strong groove. this music first puts me into a pretty good mood. It motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise. Now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up. PROPNAME PROPNAME is on guitar I believe, if not I'm pretty sure it's John PROPNAME. Now PROPNAME is playing. gosh. he's quite an impressive player. He's not showing off by playing a note every second. He takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody.   . and they're always good too. I'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime, to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing, because of a difference in style from the popular, well-advertised music of the 00's and 00's. or otherwise some people aren't even given the chance to be exposed to it. My roommate just came in the room. Speak of the devil, eh?  Take him for example. When I first met him and asked what he listened to, the first two things he said were "ORGNAME and LOCNAME LOCNAME". both of which I am not biased against or hold negative regard towards. Actually I find both bands to be quite interesting. I was exposed to PROPNAME and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school, and definately listened to it quite extensively. Side note:  it's getting hot and I'm turning on the fan. Could this music and the pressure to write as fast as I can be causing my body to heat up?  That could be quite interesting. Going back. I find it weird, well not weird but sad basically, that people like my roommate haven't heard and don't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes. "new" meaning "previously unknown" as opposed to recently released. The song just phased into an ambient sound while PROPNAME is playing over it. The drums, bass, and guitar have dropped out. When the jam comes back in. and here it comes. oh yes. Well done. Movement (change) in music I have realized (as a good explanation) is what creates uniqueness and good sound. Change can include any part of sound. pitch, tempo, tambre, etc. Now it's just the Bass and PROPNAME. On this album is PROPNAME PROPNAME on drums, PROPNAME PROPNAME is on keyboards. I'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head. My roommate is playing video games behind me. I understand his addiction. I used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school. I went to an Arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics. obviously I did well enough to get into ORGNAME, but sadly not well enough for my own standards, although I did not realize it at the time. I quit playing games during my senior year in high school, picked up some other bad habits, but since moving to LOCNAME for school things have changed nicely, and although I'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet, I guess I feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future. although the future is quite unexpected, otherwise I don't really know what I'm going to do. The song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it. . and time's up. 
__label__label0      wow this assignment seems pretty easy for a homework assignment. unfortunately I was unable to find the OPERA page for the prescreening, so I am now doing my homework although it's actually due friday. I should not procrastinate. I need to go to with my roommate to eat at j0 tomorrow at 00:00, instead of at kinsolving. I like kinsolving better than j0 but the food isn't too bad either. my girlfriend is online right now and talking to me, I wonder what her I'M box says while it flashes on my computer monitor. I will go click on it now and check. she was wondering what I had to write about for psychology class. I told her I had to write my stream of consciousness for 00 minutes. I'm starting to run out of things to say for this thing, although my mind is constantly thinking and putting material for me to write on this. wow it's only been 0 minutes so far, I still have a long way to go. I really can't think of anything to write in here. I wonder if I should capitalize all the 'I's in this thing or now, or whether grammar matters at all. oh my girlfriend IMed me again I think I'll go look at what she has to say. she has to go practice chinese for her class. hmm only 0 minutes now, I don't' think I can write for another 00 minutes. I wonder if I can just stop writing right now and just turn it in at the end of the 00 minutes. but wow this thinking is actually still providing material for me to write in this thing. stil a lot of time left, my hands are starting to get fatigued, and my contacts are drying up. it's getting late and I'm getting tired at the same time. should I go to my math class tomorrow or not. my roommate is playing a really loud tv show, it appears to be star trek enterprise, I can't really concentrate with it playing in the backgrond. I am really tempted to watch it though, instead of writing this thing, but I suppose I should write this anyway. I want to take a shower too, but I can't because I have to write in this thing for another 00 minutes. the reptilians will take their place. Says the tv show. I want to watch the show now I think I will. my roommate is pouring water into a cup and drinking from it. my body is a bit sore from working out at gregory earlier this evening. I also have a canker sore in my mouth and it does hurt a little. I think I will ask the psychology teacher tomorrow about the prescreening thing. I wonder if I'm spelling tomorrow correctly. I think I will go on to dictionary. Com and check. it appears I have spelled 'tomorrow' correctly after all. I'm satrting to just space out while writing this thing, and getting rather tired. I like playing espn football 0k0. I usually beat my friend matt in it, but not my friend philip. I have been playing for the past two hours, maybe that is why I am tired now. I wonder if my girlfriend is done studying her chinese yet. I'm going to go check her profile. she is still away. I want a glass of water, I think I will go pour one for myself. I found a bottle of ozarka that I got from my friend so I am drinking out of that. my roommate explained to me that the star trek episode he is watching is based on the time when humans just reached space and are pioneering it, a few hundred years before captain kirk. even though the series is rather new. it seems interesting. my girlfriend is having trouble memorizing chinese. my friend PROPNAME called and is now talking to me. it will be hard to multitask. I'm not really paying attention to him. he is asking me if I am eating with other friends. my friend did not get a bid for a frat, so he will not be pledging. we are going to a party on friday. perhaps with kdphi sorority. my girlfriend is asking what I am writing about again, and is falling asleep from doing homework. I am rather tired,  
__label__label1      The speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap. I only purchased them because there was a $00 mail-in rebate with them. It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow. I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other. My computer monitor is really small. It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes. College life is really not what I expected. I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to LOCNAME. I guess I just need to get acclimated to PROPNAME and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to LOCNAME as much as possible. Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable. Every one of my classes has over 000 people in them. This is a big change from my 00 people honors classes in high school. It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors. PROPNAME was really fun. I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous. Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly. I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done. Is this assignment done yet? No still 00 and a half minutes to go. This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness. I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 00 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence. I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something. I know this because my father appraised me of it. Just useless trivia I guess. I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy. But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on. The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well. I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page. Definitely not what I expected. I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had. Whew only 0 minutes to go. The printer next to me is running out of ink, which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket. You have to be thrifty in college that's for sure. My budget is $000 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 000. I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents. They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received. It felt good to make them proud. My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college. College sure is much different from high school. A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school. Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter. A lot longer than it seems like it really should. I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college. I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life. But until then, it's still hell. My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 00 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me. My one friend PROPNAME loves to just barge into my room. I played raquetball with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 0rd or 0th time to play it. None of us are really are that good. The lie detector test in Psychology class last time was cool. My hands normally get really sweaty so I'm sure I would have sent that sweat-o-meter off the charts, I wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot. 
__label__label0      Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far. Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade. Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe. I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends. At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town. Good old LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there. My roommate is also from LOCNAME LOCNAME the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on. Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well. Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt. Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there. But well back to my life in college. I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it. Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper. Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP. This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend PROPNAME showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at ORGNAME's. Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and PROPNAME didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 0 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in. So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town. I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit. When I was there it was fun the first couple of 00 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates. But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose. My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving. Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give. The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast. And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer. 
__label__label0 I thought of a million different ways I would start this, and now  I can't think of any. Well,  one way, actually, was to say that this one time I had a conversation with my teacher about  whether people thought in complete sentences or not. I told her they didn't, but now I think  they do. That is, unless, they're answering questions. In thinking that it's hot, I don't think,  "hot" I think "It's hot. "  In any case, it's very cold in my room right now. My hands and feet are  especially cold. I wonder if that's simply because of the temperature of the room or that stress  stuff Dr. PROPNAME was talking about. Well the temperature used to be just fine, and now it's  cold all of the sudden. We have to call those eminence guys. They came last week and fixed  our toilet in like 00 seconds. We didn't even see them, we just heard them. I was joking with  my roommate that God came and fixed our toilet. God rocks. ha-ha I have a black t-shirt that  says that in white letters. It's my old youth group t-shirt. I designed it. I'm quite proud of that. It was cool and promoted God. One guy once came up to me and asked me if it was being  sarcastic. that wasn't cool. He felt bad after asking though, he said he didn't mean to be rude. I believe him. He was a cool guy in several of my classes. His name was PROPNAME. There was  this other guy named PROPNAME, too. He worked in the Emergency Room at the hospital where I  used to do my clinical rotations for school. He was really cool too. Actually me and my friend,  PROPNAME, that got along with him really well kept in touch with him. She just saw him recently at the  mall with his kids, and he told her some details about a friend of ours that died about three  weeks ago. He was in the emergency room when it happened. She was in a car accident and  died almost instantly. It was pretty sad, but it didn't really affect me personally because she  wasn't that close to me. However, my OA during orientation reminded me a lot of her, and  that's kind of eerie. I say a guy that was an OA this summer at school last week. That guy was  the one that stood out the most to me because he was the nicest looking. (Not as in attractive,  as in sincerely nice. )  Some people have that effect on me sometimes. Like recently I went to  LOCNAME and the guy that was the scuba diving instructor was named PROPNAME. PROPNAME was really  cool, and he had that effect on me. He just seemed like a sincerely nice guy. I'll probably  remember him for a while. I've had several people have that effect on me. It's interesting to  meet so many people around the world that are absolutely amazing, and they may not even  know it. They're absolutely amazing to me, and I don't even know why. It's awesome. I wish I  could keep in touch with someone halfway across the world for a long time. I need to find  someone first. Maybe if I get to study abroad in LOCNAME I'll find someone to keep in touch with. Things always seem to get in the way of stuff like that, every day life I guess. I don't know what  it is. I do have this one friend, PROPNAME, I've kept in touch with him for about two years now. I  met him at a medical program one summer, and we've kept in touch since. That summer I did  lots of stuff. I went to LOCNAME for World Youth Day, and I got to see the pope. Some people got  really emotional about that. They were crying and stuff. I kind of felt bad because I wasn't  crying, but I know there really is no reason I should feel guilty. God did not say, "Thou shall be  overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the pope and come to tears. "  hah it would be kind of  funny if it said that in the bible. Anyway, that summer I also went to LDZ. That was one of the  greatest experiences ever. I've stumbled upon a few people here at LOCNAME that said, "You were  governor at LDZ, right?" It's pretty cool how lives cross. There are so many people at LOCNAME, who  wouldn't you find?  ha-ha The Monday before classes started I had an audition to try out for the  longhorn singers and we were in this tiny room in the music building, and who should walk in  the door but PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME himself!! LOCNAME It was hilarious!! He was apparently showing his  daughter around because she wanted to get in choir at LOCNAME. That's definitely a story worth  telling. I didn't recognize him. I'm to young I guess. I always figured PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME was white  only because I knew Vanilla Ice was. ha-ha  Anyway, this whole time I've been writing I've also  been thinking about PROPNAME PROPNAME (in one sentence) is the boy I've been in love with almost my  entire life. The reason why I've been thinking about him now is because a lot of the times I  write anything in journals or about what I'm thinking it's usually about him. I know this is  simply "stream of consciousness" but I guess I can't just write what I'm thinking without  thinking of him. Recently he wrote me an email after I hadn't emailed him in a while. I was  waiting for him to write me. It was short and mostly insignificant, but he wrote. I just want to  be friends, I think. I don't know what I want. I want to have lots of fun in college. I want to  experience life, then I can figure out what I want with him. It's probably not even my choice to  decided what I want with him. Anyway, another thing I also always thought about was whether  deaf people saw signs in there heads instead of heard words when they were thinking.

__label__label1 So I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing with this. just typing I guess. Damn aim. No one ever wants to instant message me until I start doing something. There are so many times when I am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. The minute I start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. All that typing and its only been two minutes. I have no idea what to type. Can your mind really go blank?  I mean, I want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because I'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously I'm thinking about something because I am typing this stuff. So my mind really isn't blank then. So I guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. My roommate is funny. I keep picturing her when I walked in the door from class earlier. She was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. How someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. Its looked so funny though. I should have took a picture. I'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. I am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. Ah. The new real world is on tonight. I absolutely love watching that show. All the drama. Its interesting to watch. Its kind of sad though I think, the way people love to watch reality shows. I mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. They film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. Can u imagine how much film ends up on the "cutting room floor" as they call it. All the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. If not made up completely at least embellished. And its all because of editing. Birthday. Someone on TV just said the word birthday. I'm so excited. My birthday is a week from tomorrow. Yeah!  but I also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. And I have no idea what to get them. Actually what to get my boyfriend. My dad is easy. A gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy. My boyfriend. I don't know. He already has plenty of cologne (did I spell that right?) so I don't want to get him that. And I always buy him clothes. I want to get him something different this time but I have no idea what. And he is going to be 00. Lucky. Everyone is leaving me behind. I am the youngest of a lot  of my friends. So now they can all go out to the bars. Without me. So sad. I still have a whole year to go. Bleh I hate waiting. Bleh. Is that a word? I type it a lot on aim. Its my way to say yucky or boring or I don't know. I heard it from somewhere though. I can't remember where. Ha-ha. My roommate is up. I wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face. Because it fell off when I came in. Bleh. I am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again. I think we should have a fall break. kind of like spring break. I need my rest. Its only the third week of school and I'm already so exhausted. I need a break.
