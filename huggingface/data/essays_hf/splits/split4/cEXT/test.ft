__label__label0 The day is over again and still so much to do and to think about. I hope my parents are settling down up in  LOCNAME with good business and a place to live. I hope no conflicts will occur although I know they are going to fight one in awhile. I miss my mom the most. she cried at the airport and I can still see those tears in her face. her voice was so weak when I called to say hello. is this it to college life? I wonder where PROPNAME is has he called me and left me a message? I have precal class with him first thing tomorrow morning and I don’t know where to go yet. I hope to get my beeper soon because I needed really bad and I don’t know when ill get it. as I look at the screen I wonder if the writing will ever go down onto the next line, or will it go on forever. I really want to go home  I feel as though I have to be with her 00/0 and I feel like she'll follow me everywhere I go. I don't want her to , but at the same time I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I hate it when she smokes she smelt so bad in the classroom wow it finally has moved down to the second line. this stream of conscious writing is kinda pain in the butt because it is nearly impossible to actually start typing without thinking about what to type. lookin at the screen uhhh she wants to come over today but I don’t want her to I feel as though she's gonna stick with me wherever I go and I feel like she's never gonna find a friend to hang out without me. but I shouldn’t think like this because she’s my friend and we've known each other forever. but I feel that she’s going to hold me back in the future as we go on. either that or we're gonna fall apart, not easily, but  I feel that someone’s gonna get hurt and I don’t want to be the one hurting her. my head itches. I gotta go home and call my mom and talk to my dad. I wish they had the same kind of water here as LOCNAME. their water is so nice. I would like to know if PROPNAME likes me or just as friends because he actually we act the same way towards each other but I don’t know if I like him or not so I wonder if he feels the same way. my pastor is here from LOCNAME to teach bible study and I kinda feel guilty because I said I’d see him and stuff when he is down here but I cant get my self to go and sit and listen to him. I feel bad. I wonder what lee is doing he seem so quiet yet outgoing but not really I would like to get to know him but I wonder if he even knows that I exist. I think he does but who knows. sitting here typing wondering what time it is . what can I eat for dinner? I have an eye appointment tomorrow and I want to meet PROPNAME somewhere so we can go to class together. cant wait to go home I’m kinda glad I didn’t room with her I can't imagine how hurt she'll be if she really knows how I feel. she gets on my nerves time to time and she asks me if she gets on my nerves, but I can never tell her that she does because I don’t think its right. I want my friends to come over to my apartment but I don’t know how my roommate is going to react. how am I suppose to find a roommate for next semester when she leaves . it almost time to go  I hope they don’t make us read this later on in the semester. I think I really want a boyfriend but not really, I don’t know what I want. PROPNAME is pretty cute only if he was taller I would fall for him so hard. but I’m glad we're good friends. I’m kinda glad that they broke up too. I think she’s too self fish and he can do so much better. I better memorize the medical terminology by Thursday. what should I do this weekend I bet she wants to come with me I feel as though every time I’m with her I’m blocked off from the crowd in a way I’m uncomfortable with her around other people. I wish she stop smoking she  looked so crappy up times up and I don’t feel like typing any more. 
__label__label0 I am wondering whether or not I should try out for the dance team. In away I want to so I will have something to be a part of but at the same time I'm fearing the inevitable rejection. Rather than be rejected I'm just not going to try but then I'll always wonder whether or not I could have made it if I had tried. If I do try out and then I fail everybody will know that I FAILED AND I'll be embarrassed. I risked failure when I pledged but I did it anyway. My neighbor failed and I didn't think any less of her so why should I think any less of myself. I'll look fat in the leotard and tights, but one reason I want to do it is so I'll stay in shape. Everything is too competitive. I wonder what my cats doing since when you gave this assignment you mentioned a dos so I started to think about my cat. Then the picture frame I got today since I have a picture of my cat but I have to get another frame for my cat picture. My entire room is decorated in cat things. I found a gecko in my room today. There not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when I lived in LOCNAME. they used to be at least a foot long. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow I have reading to do in the morning. I can't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods. My mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check, how stupid. that what you get for having an English teacher for a mother. I want to get a calendar to put up all my things. I’m scared to death I'll miss something like a homework assignment or test. I wonder if I need to be studying more often. It seems like I'm not doing enough. I don't know what I'll do if I fail. I hope I'm doing this write. It seems like the paper is just going on and on and on. I seem to worry about failure alot. I hate typing, I never memorized where the keys were so I keep goofing. My parents always told me to take typing but I was too lazy and afraid I was going to not get an A. I wonder how my sister got involved, society of women engineers. I say a bent today on the way to class. The other graduate students are coming on the 00 here. I bet it would be easier if I didn't repeat to myself what I was typing I need to go by the PROPNAME center to meet n0ice boys. Why bother I never going to get married I probably not even going to get good grades and I'll never get in to med school and I'm going to flunk out. God I hope not or I'll end up as a house wife not that that's bad but I always wanted a career and my sisters so successful. My parents would be so disappointed. Now I'm starting to sound negative like that survey said but I was much more optimistic in the survey I wonder if those ever prove anything or if people really lie to themselves when they're doing those even though they think they're being realistic this girl beside me took forever doing the survey. How much time do I have left? IS anybody even ever going to read this? Probably  that was why it was done on the internet that reminds me of the guy I sat next to in Chem. I hope he doesn't think that I was offended by his remark it doesn't bother me I'm used to it with PROPNAME and all. I feel like I've typed forever and it looks like nothing on this sheet the way it goes to infinity on the right. I keep on thinking about what to type instead of just typing what I'm think I just its just a habit from writing so many in class essays and such I'm so happy I passed the ORGNAME that way I don't have to take any English classes and I showed Mr. PROPNAME and my mother I wonder what PROPNAME's doing. He got a 0. The girl at dinner the other night was so stupid she thought she got a 000 and the SAT's and the AP's were the same thing that's why I'm not a pom that and the fact I'm not talented enough since I spent a lot of high school studying instead of dancing or anything else. I can't imagine having three hours of practice a day. I guess I had as much with games and all but it seems like a lot less. I had a ton of fun at games though and wouldn't have given it up for it now. That's how I tell whether or not it was worth it if I would trade it for something else now not that I could go back and repeat it so I guess it doesn't matter anyway.   
__label__label1 My girlfriend just ask me to turn off the CD player and do my work. ORGNAME is on and there is a women and a guy fighting for some reason. My girlfriend is now munching with her mouth wide open. I’m attempting to make Baked Potatoes but I think that they are going to burn. I went shopping to day for food and believe or not this was the cheapest trip yet. I think its because my so called girlfriend thinks that I  am thinnely challenge. . I'm trying to figure other things to write about but nothing is coming to mind. My girlfriend is still stuffing her face with frito scoops. I don't understand how she can eat just as much as I do yet she has the body of a swim suit model. Her Metabolism must be skyrocketing. My train of thought is fading again. Lets get back on track again. It is 0:00 PM and dinner is almost serve because my lover is about to feed me like a king. I trying to type as fast as I can with out a mistake. My girlfriend just ask if she could read mine yet I really don't want her to. she probably yell at me and call me an idiot. She is now eating her food in front of me and she spilt her ranch dressing all over her new shoes. (ORGNAME ORGNAME)  her baked potato looks so good right now with bacos and cheese and  I think sour cream or it may be butter. I cant really get a good look at it!!!   I'm a soph fixing to be a junior and my girlfriend is a freshmen. Yet , I'm taking classes that she's in!!!  I feel stupid the thing is she is so smart. She was valedictorian of her class. Her major is biology and mine is Kinesiology. I'm studying to be a physical therapist and she wants to save the world by saving the rain forest and finding cures for all diseases. I just transferred in from ORGNAME this semester and while I was there I took most of my basic except math and science classes. She placed out of some of  her classes. Do you see what I'm getting at. I feel insecure sometimes about my intelligence. I know I can do anything I want I just wished I would of took advantage of it when I was younger. My life would be alot better if I had just did my work when from the start. My freshman year I took 00 hrs. and dropped 00 of them. Sounds stupid huh I think working at a club  until 0 and sometimes 0 in the morning had some affect on it. My last semester at ACC I pulled a 0. 0 and this year I plan on getting a 0. 0 just to prove to myself and others that I can compete with the best of them.  
__label__label0 This the third time that I am typing this thing. I am so frustrated. Every time I get close to the 00 minutes I get cut off. There is a party I want to go to now I am here stuck here spending an hour doing this thing. I don't know what to type because I am tired of staring at this screen. It seems as if in the past two weeks  I have had no time to myself. Between pledgship, school, and studying, I have no time. The only time I spend in my room, is done sleeping. I am just going to describe what is going on in sportscenter because I haven't watched it in about a week. PROPNAME PROPNAME is talking about the upcoming pro football games this weekend. I used to idolize berman. I also liked dick vitale. I was so obsessed that I wrote him a letter. a few weeks later I got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside. I am halfway done!   I am starting to calm down. I have never been to hot-headed. I try to keep a level head all the time. The only time I really cut loose is when I am in a competition that I feel I can win. this may not be very often but when it does happen I thrive on the situation. Only eight minutes left. I really respect PROPNAME PROPNAME. he is the catcher for the rangers, my hometown team. I also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. I like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. I hope to get good grades. I wish this assignment was over. I love college football. I loved to play football but I never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level I wanted to . I hate danny  schayes. his dad was a great basketball player. One minute left!!  my favorite team is the cowboys. I love going to the games and cheering them on to victory. I think my time is up so I will write later!  the simpsons is the best show on tv by the way. and caddyshack is the bast movie ever! 
__label__label1 Wrecks. They are the worst things ever. I can't believe princess PROPNAME died  yesterday. It shows that anyone can die at any moment. Of all people, a  princess, a mother, an internationally known woman, a philanthropical figure  in this world. It's sad. Yesterday I was running down the street to pick up  an anklet for a friend and I saw a wreck happen. it is scary. luckily no one  was hurt but it could've been alot worse. The anklet was awesome though. I  kind of wish that the one I bought was like hers but that’s okay because I got  an even better one later on in the day. I had to sit for almost an hour to  wait for the police to come because I witnessed that stupid wreck. and then  they didn't show so I just gave the girl my name and phone number and then I  left. I have better things to do, like eat. The food here really isn't that  bad. I haven't been eating from much of a variety though. Everyday I eat  from a choice of about four meals. I can live like that though. My roommate  is really starting to bother me. I should have known this would happen , but  everyone always thinks "that will never happen to me". Just like getting in  a car wreck, getting pregnant, or getting a disease like aids or something. I hope I never get any of those things. I don't know what I would do. I'd  feel like such a failure. It does happen to so many people though. And  everyone deals with it in a different way. to each his own. And everything is  just fine to me just now. no need for me to change my life,  I have my friends , my boy, my studies, my sorority, and my own life here in college. Being away  from the parents is such an amazing feeling. just the fact that we are proving  to ourselves that we can do it on our own. feed ourselves, discipline  ourselves, control ourselves, wash our laundry and all that stuff. I’m doing  okay. but I know for a fact that not everyone has been handling themselves as  well as I have. I am me and I am okay. 
__label__label1 Well, here goes. I'm in my room right now and it's very warm. My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. PROPNAME came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish PROPNAME could stay here with me in LOCNAME. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. PROPNAME say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can I’m restricted to because of my boyfriend PROPNAME. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at PROPNAME because PROPNAME wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. PROPNAME doesn't like the thought of me and PROPNAME spending time  together. He's weird like that. PROPNAME should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. PROPNAME is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. PROPNAME doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 0th. PROPNAME's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that I’ll be going to the renaissance festival  with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. PROPNAME  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into PROPNAME. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If y’all read this y’all will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked PROPNAME. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again PROPNAME can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love ORGNAME. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  I’m partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. It’s resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. PROPNAME left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to PROPNAME. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with PROPNAME in LOCNAME. We went to ORGNAME with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. 
__label__label0 Today my aunt PROPNAME came up to visit me. she was on a trip out here for business meetings. She told me a bunch of stories about her life at LOCNAME when she went here 00 years ago. she told that she was almost raped by a serial rapist the police had been trying to catch for two years. He had been stalking her for weeks, and she never even knew. the only other person I knew who this had happened to is a friend of mine who had an abusive boyfriend who would rape her on a daily basis. she's finally doing a lot better, but still has kind of a loser boyfriend. guys are just weird that way. I've been going out with the same guy for close to two and a half years now, and it looks like we might get married!  I'm really excited about that, we've had lots of plans about various things, but I don't know. we want a house and kids and that whole thing. today in art class, one lady had a quilt as her piece to express an emotion and it really brought me that sense of home. It was so pretty, it had a floral design, but also had these powder green and white solid pieces. It really made me feel at home and almost at my grandma's house. she's got a quilt her mother made, and it is about seventy years old. It was made from material of old clothes that no one fit into anymore. Their family was so incredibly poor that they lived out in the countryside, and worked in the fields. my grandmother has told stories of her life, some gruesome and some amazing. she used to be the one to cut off the heads of the chickens they ate, and it was nothing to her just normal. other times she can remember riding through the country side on her horse where there are now huge freeways and shopping centers. I often wonder what it would be like living back then. she gave me a magazine clipping of how life was like as a teacher back then (she was a teacher, and I am going to be a teacher) and I’m am really glad that we are well on our way into the twenty first century!  they used to not be able to be married, have children, they had to go to church every Sunday, clean the classroom at least once a week on their hands and knees with a hand brush, and all these other gruesome things. the only thing I have to worry about are the guns and cuts that go on in the schools (maybe it would be better to go back to the old days, huh?)  I want to be an art teacher, but I’m not sure how that will all work out. my major will allow me to be an artist but with an all-level teaching certificate on the side. so. I can either be a starving artist or a starving teacher!  (both kind of sad)  however, I don't really want to have to be out there working, I’m more of a homebody, and want to be the typical housewife. everyone I know thinks I’m crazy, but that has been my goal (perhaps "dream" is too strong a word) ever since I can remember. I have also wanted five children since the time I was about eight years old. I actually come from a family of four children, so maybe the fifth I want is an unconscious way of somehow "outdoing" my parents. that has often worried me because it's kind of what it sounds like, but I really don't feel that way. my parents were actually the ones who first brought it up, so I don't know. 
__label__label0 Right now I am having a weird feeling in the lower part of my stomach. I'm not sure if I just had a bad lunch or if it may be something a little more serious. I'm kind of sad too. I talked to my family earlier and I realized how much I missed being at home. Last night I attempted to meet some new people despite the fact that I am just not the social type so I am kind of down about that too. I hate walking up and down the stairs and stuff here at u. t. I can't stand the heat. I mean I am from the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME but I never had to walk EVERYWHERE. I hate the food in Jester. I know I wasn't supposed to talk about this until my second assignment, but right now college controls most of what I am thinking right now. I forgot, keep typing, keep typing. In a sense this stream of consciousness isn't as relaxed or real as one might assume it may be. A lot of the thoughts are a little forced because you would have to put your thoughts into words. That itself isn't too natural. I am not a computer person either. I guess it could be worse and I could be an EXTREMELY slow typer as well. Phew. You know, this isn't so bad. It's kind of fun. This assignment simply requires that you ramble for twenty minutes. It's kind of quiet in here. I just realized that. My fingernails are really short. I wish they could be a little longer. a little more feminine. One day I wake up and they are on their way to getting long and the next day I wake up and I've either pulled on or bit them. Even though I am not really the social type, I have managed to make some friends. yea for me. this guy in front of me looks like he's all into his homework when I bet he's just e-mailing his chick back home. Even though I just used the word "chick" I am not sexist. In fact, I  hate that word. I'm not exactly into all this equal rights stuff. I think it is okay for men to play the macho, take charge role in society. I mean, women are, as an entirety , weaker. So what if we are the ones who play the nurturing half of the species?  We have our strong points and so do men. It balances out. Every once and a while you get a person who is stronger in a different and/or unnatural area, but that is fine with me too. There are a lot of computers in this room. While I typed that I had another thought but I can't type 0 things at once so you just missed out on something. of course it wasn't important so who really cares?  bop bop bop bop my brain stopped throwing out ideas just then. My friends are sitting to each side of me. I haven’t talked to them since I started this assignment so it feels weird. Oh, wait. I had to talk to one briefly about why this thing typed all the way down to what seemed infinity until it returned to the next line. She just told me to wait. Everyone says you gain fifteen pounds when you get to college. I hope that is not true because I already feel fat enough as it is. So, have you sat down for twenty minutes and tried this assignment?  How did it turn out for you?  This is a pretty big screen. Pretty big, indeed. I'm pretending to type fast. I hit keys and everyone probably thinks I'm on a role with what I am thinking, when in reality I am just pretending. Crazy, huh. Wouldn't it be weird if I just snapped and from here on out everything I thought was as random and crazy as this. this isn't a personality profile is it? You aren't going to call me in some time and discharge me from UT are you?  I guess this isn't what you had in mind for stream of consciousness (I don’t want to spell it takes too much brain power) but I hope its kind of what I was supposed to do. I am one of those students who is always scared of turning in assignments because they might be just plain wrong. I'm really tires of typing. I just read what I typed "I’m really 'tires' of typing" that's pretty stupid. at least I know I am not one of those people who thinks a bunch of bad words when I am freethinking. Or at least I don’t think about sex or anything. Well, I did talk about men and women and equal rights so I guess that kind of applies. When I play with the keyboard it sounds kind of like a horserace. Try it, it does. All you have to do is establish a rhythm. My fingers hurt still. I wish I was really fluent in another language. type, I don’t want to type. type I don’t want to type. believe it or not those words just took the form as a song in my head. I cheated. I just talked to my friends sitting next to me. I BROKE. again. I think I went a little over but this has been kind of fun.   
__label__label1 I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to ORGNAME. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldn’t figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an "f". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 0 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because I’m here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at ORGNAME because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to ORGNAME's. We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. He needs 00 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 00, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. PROPNAME just walked in and said Hi!. now she looked at my screen I'm not crazy, I am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me.  I needed to get this done today because I have plans for the rest of the week after Wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. I should've recorded what time I started typing, huh!  that would have been beneficial. I’m retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes I have no common sense. I wonder what my grades will be like this semester. I am used to straight A’s, and I hope I can accomplish this in college as well. I need to petition my AP grades sometime soon, but I don't know when or where. oh, well, I’ll look it up somewhere, and get it done. I need to do some laundry today, too. I am running out of plain little T-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe I’ll find something cute while I’m shopping today. I hoe my boyfriend ( PROPNAME is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think I am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what I am engraving into it. so he'll remember. I am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. I need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz I am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know I live at 00th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. I think I have been typing for twenty minutes so I am going to submit this. I wonder what happens if I didn't type for twenty minutes. what if I don't get credit. maybe I’ll keep going for another minute. I checked my mailbox when I came in, and I didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on Friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. I think I am running out of things to say, so I’ll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line. 
__label__label1 It took me forever to get into this program I had the address written all down wrong and now I am going to be late for practice PROPNAME is waiting for me and she is not going to be happy I can't believe I have a flat tire everyone was honking at me to tell me on MLK. oh well so I had to walk here and now I am running completely behind schedule I am gonna get PROPNAME to fix my tire tonight when he gets off work I hope he knows how to change a flat and where to take it because I have no idea he won't mind he is really a cool guy what am I gonna do until then I guess I’ll just walk back home to it is good exercise for me any way now I am so sidetracked I don’t know what to write my parents are coming Friday so now I have to clean for them and that I have absolutely no time for but I guess I'll have to find it gosh my typing is terrible and I keep hitting the wrong letters since I haven't typed all summer. this computer thing is not for me I am so computer illiterate but I am very open to learning if someone would teach me I don't want to go to work on Friday I really don’t like it there anymore I probably should quit then I would have no money whatsoever that it'll be nice maybe I will starve and lose some weight I really didn't me that I could never starve myself I love food too much my gosh PROPNAME is going to be pretty mad since I was suppose to be at practice ten minutes ago to teach her what we learned now she is just going to be waiting on  me because I am gonna have to walk down there and it will take forever. my car hasn't had a flat in such a long time I wonder what I hit because I didn't see anything in the tire but what do I know. my mind is just going blank nothing can run through it cause I’m so tired. I want my shoes back from winstons house they have been there for a week now and they are my favorites but I can't remember exactly how to get there I would probably get lost I can't wait for this weekend the game will be so much fun and I won't be so nervous for it this time I wonder how many people will be there for ORGNAME how exciting I am so glad I talked to my friend PROPNAME last night he sounds like he is having so much fun in LOCNAME at occidental I can't wait to visit him he says his classes are pretty tough I would probably drop out! just picking it wouldn't hurt to get a good kick in the butt to get myself in gear. gosh twenty minutes seems like forever to put down all your thoughts I don't even remember what I have attempted to type so far I think my time is almost up though and then I can run to bellmont to help PROPNAME who has no clue where I am I was suppose to call my friend PROPNAME last night to see how rush went at her school and I didn't I am a little curious to see what she picked I cant believe she hasn't called to tell me because I am her best friend but I guess I can forgive and forget but hopefully she'll call me tonight last night I talked to rhiannon and she sounded so upset I hope things will get better for her I am so tired I am falling asleep good thing my time is just about up because I am exhausted naturally I cant go take a nap because I have practice I guess its all worth it in the end because I get to perform for a lot of people but sometimes it seems like a waist because no one bothers to tell the new girls what is going on and then we look like idiots I want so much to say something but so far I have kept my mouth shut and just had my own kind of fun I don’t know if they act this way on purpose or they just don't know exactly what they are doing I try my hardest and ever since I hurt my knee it has sucked tremendously I can't strut my usual stuff and I just want to scream because no one knows how much it hurts well it has been well over 00 minutes now so I am going to practice bye! 
__label__label1 I've decided that I want to write for travel and leisure magazine. I love to write. I think I am pretty good at it too. My brother went back to LOCNAME to interview for a job with a real estate agency. He want s to be a commercial realtor. No matter what my brother decides to do he will be really successful. I'm not saying that I am a psychic or anything like that, but I know how badly my brother wants to be successful, and when he wants something, he goes out and gets it. PROPNAME and I have become much closer as I have gotten older. He is being so nice to me since I got to LOCNAME too. I think he is realizing that I am not such a bad kid after all. He always tells me to be careful and look out for myself because he won't always be in LOCNAME to take care ORGNAME me. My brother and my dad look a lot alike too. my dad is really tall: Six feet seven inches tall to be exact. H played basketball in high school, but he wasn't good enough to play in college. I think that is why he always pushed my brother to play so much that he drove PROPNAME away from the sport. I played field hockey in high school. If I didn't come to The ORGNAME of ORGNAME, I was going to try to play field hockey at a division one school. I'm really happy with the decision I made though. I am having so much fun here. I really miss my family, or, I guess you could say, lack thereof, in LOCNAME. I miss my mom and my step-dad, and my dad. My brother told me that he was so much happier when he moved to Austin. I could tell too because he didn't come home very much his freshman year. I don't think my brother likes my mom very much because whenever he comes home, they fight. I think my brother is still bothered by the divorce. I never gave myself a chance to be bothered, so I think now that I am away from home and I have all of this time to think, the divorce is starting to bother me. I wonder what parent's weekend is going to be like. I guess I'll ask my brother what he did when both of our parent's showed up ready and willing to steal him from the other parent. I will just divide up the weekend: one parent gets me one night, and the other parent will get me the next night. What is sad, is that I want to get them the whole weekend: both parents on both nights. I hate it when my friends' parents are around because it makes me think of how I can't have my real family back together ever again. By the way, I have a terrible habit of feeling sorry for myself. Things could be so much worse. I feel really lucky to be able to attend college, live where I live, have both parents who love me, be blessed with so much athletic ability. I know I am lucky, but every now and again I like to play the victim. My boyfriend is the best friend I could ever have. He always wants me to feel like I can talk to him, but he never lets me make excuses for myself if you know what I mean. He always reminds me that everyone has their hardships, but those who choose to overcome their hardships instead of letting their hardships overcome them, those are the ones who end up being happy. Twenty minutes is up! 
__label__label0 I am sitting here writing this on a Sunday afternoon. Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 00 years old. I think I am going out to eat with my parents tomorrow night. It is sunny outside right now. I do not feel like sitting inside and working. I think this is cool how we can turn this assignment in over ORGNAME web. I wish more assignments could be like this. In almost 0 and a half hours I will be 00. That sounds so weird to me right now. Last night I went to the ORGNAME ORGNAME the ORGNAME concert. It was pretty fun. I went with a bunch of friends. Sort of like an early birthday present. I am running out of things to write. I have a Spanish project to do after this. I still have Rage songs in my head from last night. There were so many people there last night. I heard that over 00,000 tickets were sold. It seemed like that many people were there. I am still tired from the show last night. I was disappointed that one of the opening acts for the show didn't make it. I wonder what I will get for my birthday. I already got a GoodFellas poster from one of my friends. GoodFellas is my favorite movie. I have the movie and seen it at least 00 times. I want to take a nap, but I have to much work to do. Hmm, can't think of what to type. I hope I get some money for my birthday. I guess I'll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out. Later I am going to call a friend of mine who I haven't talked to in a while. Last night I slept with my contacts on. I better go take them off after this. I don't think that is good for my eyes. So far the school year is off to a good start. I am seeing friends I haven't seen in a while. 
__label__label0 I just wrote for about  00 minutes and I accidentally cleared it all so I’m just going to write poetry.      good enough. hey your glass is empty its a hell of a long way home . why  don’t you let me take you its no good to go alone. I never would have opened up but you seemed so real to me. after all the bullshit I've heard its refreshing not to see. I don’t have to pretend . she doesn’t expect it from me. so don’t tell me why I haven’t been good to you. don’t tell me I haven’t been good to you. just tell me why nothing is good enough                                                                                hey little girl would you like some candy . momma said its ok. the door is open come on outside . no I cant come out to play . its not the wind that cracked your shoulder . who’s there that makes you so afraid you’re shaking to the bone . you know I don’t understand you deserve so much more than this so just tell me why he’s never been good to you don’t tell me why he’s never been there for you. ill tell you that why is simply not good enough. I can be good to you and I will be there for you and ill show you why your so much more than good enough. that was just some stuff I made up in my head I hope it is what you were looking for in this stuff. 
__label__label0 I have a feeling this is going to be a long 00 minutes. I don't even know where to start, and I don't think I really care. oh well. ORGNAME plays LOCNAME LOCNAME tonight. I hope ORGNAME crushes them. I wish I was in LOCNAME right now. Sunny skies and 00 degrees. My roommate is an idiot. I don't think he thinks before he speaks. He is the clumsiest person I have ever met. what else should I say?  I still feel sick from last night. Too much Beast!!  I've got to get replenished for tonight. Lots of good football and beer. Hopefully some bitches will be here. I smell food in the kitchen. I'm hungry as fuck. All I’ve eaten this morning is Fruity Pebbles. I love Fruity Pebbles. I need more milk from the store. The ORGNAME play tomorrow night at 0:00. LOCNAME is the greatest city in the world. Nobody does it better!!  I can't wait to get home in a month or so. I need to go to the bathroom, but I guess I can hold it in for another 00 minutes. This is a waste of time. I wonder what you people can find out from this stuff. Random thoughts are weird. My eyes hurt. I need to go to the bathroom. It sounds like LOCNAME is beating ORGNAME. I hate ORGNAME. ORGNAME is the shit!!  I need to call my old roommate from ORGNAME. I need to eat. This is boring. I wonder how much time I have left. It looks like 00 minutes more. My roommate is obnoxious. He never stops talking and usually says nothing of importance. I think he has some serious problems. Maybe not. The girl next door is hot. I hope she comes over tonight to watch the UT game. She's got a great body. I'm still hungry. I need to get a job. My funds are running a little low. I waste too much money. I hope I win the lottery tonight. I hate this assignment. I guess it's pretty easy though. I better get an A in this class. I hate BA000. It is a pointless class. I need to do my assignment in there. I miss my homies in LOCNAME. I love kickin' it with them. You can't beat good friends and good beer. I wonder why I like to drink. It makes me feel good at the time, but I feel like shit every morning. I don't even remember when I started to drink in high school. Malt liquor is nasty, but when you're on a budget it hits the spot. Magnum. When I turn 00 I'm going to go nutty. LOCNAME LOCNAME here I come. only 0 more months. I better not fuck up when I turn 00. I need to keep getting good grades. Only 0 more years of this crap. I can't say that I've learned anything significant in college. All it's taught me is that you have to have one to get a job, but from there it is all on your shoulders. I like my summer job. Real world experience is better than book learning. I'm pretty sure they will hire me on after I graduate. I love computers. I guess that's why I'm an MIS major. They have so much power it is unbelievable. I need to eat. When I'm done maybe I’ll order a pizza. My roommate is so loud. I'm gonna yell at his lazy ass. All he does while I'm at school is sleep and watch TV. Rough life. I need to take out the trash. I need to get some beer for tonight. Maybe something ritzy. I need to get a job. I wish all assignments were this easy. Too many classes and not enough time. I need to find a girlfriend. The girl next door has potential. It's Party Time by PROPNAME PROPNAME is on the radio. It's the jam. I love rap music. The beats are great and that's why I love it. He is the clumsiest person in the world. If my window is broken I will kick his ass. What a fool. It's Party time, whoa yeah it's party time, we havin a party. Time's up. 
__label__label1 Why am I doing this assignment?  I do not want to be here? I think I want to go to sleep. I wish PROPNAME would shut up so I could do my homework. When I play basketball I wish PROPNAME would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish PROPNAME would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in LOCNAME. PROPNAME needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish PROPNAME would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. PROPNAME needs to shut up. PROPNAME is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. PROPNAME better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily PROPNAME left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket. I need to find that guys number but I lost it so I guess I will never find it. I hate HOT I think they are gay . So I do not know why PROPNAME is listening to it. I wish I could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. Why doesn’t he listen to some other music that sounds better. I wish I could go back home and drive my car. I miss driving my car. I got a ORGNAME Civic. It is silver and it is all mine. I am thinking about bringing it up next semester. I wish they would turn this music off but then again why do I care. I wish they would play some Tupac or Snoop. I have two more minutes. I wish the two minute would go by faster. I need to get some carpet for my room . I'm thinking about switching my major. I might go to business or I might just stick Psychology and try to go into physical therapy after I finish college. I have one more minute left and then I am done. Toad is stupid. I hate Puff Daddy this song is sop overplayed. 
__label__label1 I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 0 to 00 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 00 concert. I love PROPNAME so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. PROPNAME, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 0. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to LOCNAME to see everybody there and especially PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Mrs. PROPNAME, and of course PROPNAME. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. PROPNAME needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 0 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the ORGNAME win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up. 
__label__label0 College seems very stressful. It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 00000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs LOCNAME. The attitude of "wanting to learn " is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess PROPNAME tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is "Greatness courts failure"  I don’t think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw PROPNAME in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the PROPNAME PROPNAME '00 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in LOCNAME when PROPNAME was released (Didn’t happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was PROPNAME PROPNAME, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though 
__label__label1 I absolutely hate Mondays they make everything seem to last forever, except for the weekend. minutes seem longer, hours seem longer, the entire day drags without any hope for it to end. But in actuality, if Mondays were obliterated from the week, Tuesdays would simply inherit the mundane tasks of being the first day of the week and the thief of the weekend. weekends are not exactly the most practical approach to leisure activity. the "fun" things in life we wait to do until the weekend and try to cram everything into the two days that can not possibly be accomplished only to start out the new week  on a Monday nonetheless  with drained energy, hangovers, for some, and incredibly lethargic. a better approach would be to evenly space the week out with "leisure days" in between week days. also by random people taking off different leisure days, the maximum enjoyment could be appreciated due to less crowding, fewer lines, less traffic, etc. traffic is far too overrated. the idea of everyone trying to get one place at one time is beyond me . if every one had their own schedules, for instance of everyone could decide for themselves, when their necessary lunch time was instead of the standard 00:00, the roads and restaurants at that time would probably be less crowded, therefore, traffic would decrease. if traffic were lessened everyone would probably be less cranky and agitated. cranky people are just entirely too obnoxious and loud. simply because of their crankiness is everyone else cranky. its like a yawn  once someone else begins to complain about things, you find yourself griping about little nit picky things over which you have no control  perky people are the same way only usually they are responsible for the cranky people being cranky. I guess it all goes  to say that there is such a thing as too much of anything. you can be too cranky and you can be too perky    
__label__label0 Damn. Rum and ORGNAME sure does taste good. Pretty fucking good, in fact. Hitting return after every line of text that I type really sucks. I see danger danger danger on the corner sent by me shadows the ways straight away you ran from me heard you calling yes I heard you calling heard you calling yes I heard you calling NO rules. Why do all the good groups have to stop recording before I get a chance to see them?  Why does everything piss me off?  When I smile, people see the devil. The devil's cool and all, but he's still the devil. In my dreams I saw you there it was kind of neat because after all I recognized you but it was still a dream about me about you about we never had a chance to get to know each other really well you were always this and I was always that and we were never it became a big problem when you took the easy way out of my mind but as I was saying it was a dream and you were there and so was I and I knew it was a dream but how could it have been a dream when it was so real life experience I started to fly, I started to defy gravity pulls us all back down to earth mother earth you angel you rock you bitch you have made everything so wonderfully evil because of you I am here and without you I would surely perish and it is all your fault and scar and torment you place deep inside of my soul wish is to be free yet I am not for I stand here wondering waiting for the time when I can be liberated, walk freely as you intended  but I saw you there you were. And you were dressed differently too. Not wearing earth clothing. Of course neither was I. Red, red, red. honor, courage. blood. Blood from me, blood from you, blood from LOCNAME, from we, who I saw there we were wondering, waiting for something grand to happen upon us while we stood there. The clouds flew overhead like a fast motion video as the world passed us by. holding onto my trusty staff I heard the world around me scream, shout, laugh, cry. crumble  and crumble did I lost my eyes that day I found something different and the world has not been the same since I found them everything has been a little wild a little different a little crazy how things like this end up working out when we see each other, and when we went out back into the world from our little sanctuary from the world we were stuck in, hurt in  side my brain is where this shit all resides and I have a feeling it's stuck here because I'm still here and you're not 
__label__label1 the end of this song is so weird. what was PROPNAME on when he thought of it. now this song is pretty cool. it bumps. too bad my sax solo was gay. I think that funk is the coolest type of music. I can't believe that maceo parker is  playing at antones. I am so there. I can't believe I remembered the number man, I wish I could get rid of my damn computer virus. what a pain. my knee hurts. I so stupid for busting it. I think that my dorm room has to be the coolest in jester. jeff is such a pimp. too bad he sounds kind of white. PROPNAMEsh is the coolest though. he's just about the funkiest drummer I’ve ever played with. I don't know if I’m supposed to be pressing enter, but if I don't I start writing off of the screen. I think that I’m gonna like psychology. it's pretty interesting. I hope my stereo is bugging anybody. the concert tonight is gonna be cool. I just hope that I don't get killed. this song  cracks me up. I gotta leave in 00 minutes. I better have a lot of sugar to keep me awake. I can't believe how tired I was last night. maybe I should  have slept over at the girls place. I got to record my CD and send it to b. I’ve gotta find out when I need to take defensive driving. these pizza rolls are so good. man, jester food sucks. the only good thing is the cereal. salads are ok. the pizza is decent too. my new hat sucks. it's really  uncomfortable. my brother is so whipped. me and my twin brother aren't really a lot alike. he is so disgusting when he's around his girlfriend. I guess that keyboarding class paid off. paid or paid. ly or lie. die or. . . well maybe not. what the hell am I talking about. this is a pretty crazy assignment. over half way done. it pisses me off when my posters fall off of my wall. CD’s over. what do I want now. how 'bout a little screaming headless torsos. they are the coolest. PROPNAME jo PROPNAME is the most amazing drummer in the world. too bad I can't go to the first game. I still gotta get that sports package. some much to do, so little time. almost done now. my mind has gone blank. I’ve got to wash my clothes. if I don't do that tomorrow, I’m gonna smell all damn week. I’ve got to read a lot this weekend. this is boring. I’m sure who ever might read this cares very little about what I’m saying. oh well. looks like my time is up now. just gotta push the submit button. bye. 
__label__label0 TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn’t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my ORGNAME class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 0 classes to attend. English at 0 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 0:00 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 0:00 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 0tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won’t probably ever be true until I'm about 00 and he's 00. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away ORGNAME by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My ORGNAME teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since ORGNAME's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 0 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   
__label__label0 I'm just sitting here thinking while I wait for my clothes to clean. While sitting here I realize how much my life is different in LOCNAME rather than two hundred and eighty miles away in LOCNAME. For example, I always had someone to do my laundry there and if I did it myself I never had to wait for a washing machine. PROPNAMEhe thing I miss most about LOCNAME is not having my friends around. Even though my best friend and my girlfriend are also attending PROPNAME T and both are staying in Jester I still miss my other friends a lot. I always thought when I came to Austin it was going to be so much fun, but now I realize there is a lot of work involved. Only a week has gone by since I got here and I already have so much to do. That is another thing I miss about home, the ability to do nothing if I so desire. Here "doing nothing" is not an option. I feel that if I do nothing I will fall behind and just be wasting time. I miss the little things about home. Even though my girlfriend lives here I miss being able to go to each others house. Sure we can go to each others dorm rooms but I miss the feeling of home and hanging out with her family and mine. That is another thing I have not mentioned yet, I miss my family. I honestly did not think I would but I do. I guess over time I will grow accustomed to living here and maybe eventually be able to call Austin my home. Well, it's time to put the clothes in the dryer so I guess this is the end. 
__label__label1 Ok, my thoughts for 00 min. It's 0:00 right now so I'll be done at 0:00. I feel like a moron doing this. I don't even know how to use internet. I wish PROPNAME hurry up and come set up my Ethernet. I really need to write PROPNAME a letter. I bet she's mad at me since I wrote PROPNAME and not her. Where and when and how am I going to type this up. It's only been 0 min!  00 more minutes of free thoughts. PROPNAME sure has been on the phone for a long time. she's always on the phone with 'T', PROPNAME. They always get in fights too. I wonder if it's ok for me to ask her about that guy she met in LOCNAME that asked her out. Probably not since she turned red and silent when PROPNAME pointed out her hickey. I guess I won't say anything. My hand kind of hurts now. I think alot faster than I write. I wonder if that was someone at he door just a second ago. You know, maybe I'll write up both of these assignments tonight and then type them up on different days. Nah, I don't feel like doing the college one tonight. I am such a bad typist. This would have been so much shorter if I just typed it rather than transpose my thoughts. I don't think I'll worry about spelling correctly when I do type this. PROPNAME is still on the phone and PROPNAME has not come to fix my computer yet. I guess I have less power over him since he made out with some chick  on Saturday. Sexual tension can be such a powerful tool. Hmmm, what time is it? 0:00, only 0 more minutes to go. My head itches, now my nose. Ah, that's much better. I wonder if PROPNAME really does like PROPNAME. It seems like it sometimes. Channing hates PROPNAME because of it. can't believe I spilled out some of my innermost secrets to PROPNAME and he's so rude to me sometimes. I sure do miss PROPNAME. I wonder if he'll write me. As soon as LOCNAME gets my letter she'll probably send me his address. I'm not going to write to him though unless he writes me first. I really like my handwriting. It looks very similar to my mother's. What time is it now? 0:00. I'm done. I can't believe I thought such stupid things in these past 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 Well, here it goes. I don't know exactly what to write about because my mind  is sort of blank to real thoughts as I've been studying all day. But I'll start with what is the most important thing to me right now--loneliness. What better thing to write about when you're listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME. Anyway, it's not the clinical loneliness from which I suffer. It's more of a deprivation I guess. It's a deprivation of emotional intimacy. You see, I have quite a few male friends  which is great because male bonding is always a must. But I'm the type of guy  who always needs a deep relationship with a girl. It gives me a sort of basis in my life. Everything falls into place. I do better academically if I'm in love with a girl and I  am more confident about everything I do. I am so much happier when I'm in love. Basically, when comes down to it, I love being in love. How do I know?  Well, I've been there before. I fell deeply in love with a girl in my junior year of high school. Yeah, yeah, I know "you were too young to know what love was. "  I really wasn't. There's a PROPNAME PROPNAME song which says           "How do I know when it's love?          I can't tell ya' but it lasts forever.        How does it feel when it's love?          It's just something you feel together. '  Well, I completely relate to the togetherness part and lately I've come to realize  that I can also relate to the foreverness part, too. There will always be a place in my heart for LOCNAME. But she isn't the point. She is what was. And life isn't what was, it's what's going to be. All I'm saying is that I know what love is and how to love. I want it back . But it's so hard up here at LOCNAME to find it, or so it seems. I should be able to find it because I'm pretty good-looking and I've really turned into a nice person. But every girl that catches my seems so unapproachable. But, there's another factor in this whole game. I'm already in love. I'm in love with someone who  lives back in The Woodlands. I had a crush on this girl since my sophomore year and somehow we developed a friendship where both of us went through some peculiar twists. You see, we know we both liked each other and we both wanted to do something about it but we didn't. I didn't because I felt that if I told how I really felt, she  wouldn't understand and run away from me(metaphorically). She didn't do it because  I don't think she knew what she was feeling. She's never been there before so she's not familiar with the symptoms. It took me a while to figure mine out with PROPNAME, but when it happened, I knew the second it hit me. I think it's hit her but  she doesn't know what to do. Well, my twenty minutes is up so I'm gonna' cruise. But I might actually get on here on  do this out of pure enjoyment. You see, I always do this. I always sit down and throw up all this junk onto paper and then sift through the vomit afterwards. It helps when you're stressed. Anyway, thanks for listening, and if no one ever reads this  I DO THINK BERT FROM SESAME STREET IS EVIL. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE, GET ON THE NET AND FIND THE BERT IS EVIL WEBSITE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!        
__label__label0 Wow, I'm pretty tired right now it's been a heck of a weekend. staying up for PROPNAME's funeral was pointless, but nevertheless interesting. I wonder if I'll have that kind of burial when I die. I think my grandfather  should at least had a funeral twice that size. he was the second greatest man to ever walk on this earth besides PROPNAME PROPNAME himself. I'm listening to the live dcTalk album right now and it rocks. There is no group of celebrities that I admire more than them. Their music has meaning. It isn't just the meaningless stuff about drugs, shooting somebody up, or scoring with someone. It is stuff that is relevant to our world and to our generation, not to mention it is the best musically sounding stuff out there. I wish more people knew about them. I know they would agree with me. the game this weekend surpassed my expectations. At first I thought it was going to be lame 'cause the crowd was soo dead, but as soon as we scored the crowd went wild and the atmosphere from then on was electric. ORGNAME will be a very tuff game next weekend. My parents are coming up for the game. Surprisingly I don't miss them all that much, although  I do care about them a bunch. Maybe it's just because I'm soo busy with school I really hope that my edp paper is not that hard because I lack the motivation. I really wish my acne would go away. I believe life would be soo much better if it were gone. The confidence and social skills would be so easy and fun. I wouldn't be soo much of a hermit. I hope I can get my hair to grow out to the right length and get it colored they way I want to. I also hope that I can acquire the presence I am seeking as far as my appearance goes. It would really be awesome if we won a national championship this year and PROPNAME PROPNAME won a Heisman Trophy or even PROPNAME PROPNAME( by the way I hope he is okay). PROPNAME PROPNAME did a great job backing up and filling in. Gee I hope I make it to class on time and I really hope my future girlfriend is there to ask me out. 
__label__label1 Aug. 00  Note: I wrote this paper over a week ago and I am just now typing it. You said we could write it down first and then type it.  I have finally found the inspiration to write this paper. Today is August 00. The time is 0:00 A. M. I am watching television and at the same time trying to write this paper. Today is a very sad day for many . The new of Princess PROPNAME’s death has just unfolded. It is very strange that every time a prominent "celeb" dies the world acts as if they knew them personally. I case in Princess PROPNAME's death the world did kind of know her rather intimately since her life was unfortunately always being publicized. I just looked around my room watching my roommate and another one of my friends gasp in horror of the tragic news. The newscasters are explaining how her death occurred. I think she was a very lucky woman and very unfortunate at the same time. PROPNAME's "Princess fairy tale" seems to be more a tale of horror. I keep thinking about her children. I think their mother was the only one who truly let them know what being young and living life was all about. I think that small ounce of joy will die with her death. My sweetmate just walked in. It seems all of a sudden we've got a party in our room . It's very hard to concentrate on writing this paper and listen to the news all at the same time. The phone is ringing. I hope it's not for me. I always get interrupted when I doing something important. The phone is for my roommate. Her mom calls twice a day at the same time every day to check how my roommate is doing. Maybe she heard the new of PROPNAME and it made her even more anxious to call. Whenever someone dies it always reminds us of what is most important. The time is 0:00 A. M. I am really getting tired and it's hard to write this paper, but if this paper means making the grade I want, I guess I'm going to have to force myself to keep going. They are discussing the "fairytale" wedding and Prince "charming" . It seem ver sad that she only experience the fairytale for such a short period of time. This whole disaster is making me ver nostalgic. I'm starting to think about some of the friends I lost in reckless accidents. The only difference is , they died from their own irresponsible actions. I'm thinking about a friend of my, I suppose we can call her "Sorry" because her life really is a sorry tale. She is a girl who possessed so much potential and ability, but ruined it because she decided she cared more about drinking, driving, and fun more than her future. Her irresponsible ways killed a friend who was in the same car. This friend was pregnant. Two lives lost in 0 instant. Three other lives in the car were saved by fate I suppose. "Sorry continues to drink, drive, and live recklessly. I have lost alot of respect for her. I kind of think her current actions are more sign of self-destruction. I guess she feels her future fun times are going to be cut off very soon and she might as well have fun while she can. Her court date for involuntary manslaughter is coming up. I wonder how reckless "Sorry" can be in prison. 
__label__label0 I don't like people to know how my mind works if I don't even know them. I guess I have always been protective of my true thoughts and feelings. The irony is that the more you reveal of your self, the better you get to know and become closer to your friends. The first few steps of trust can be some of the hardest (besides the ones after a loss of trust). I think that it is possible to gain trust back. It takes a long time and complete honesty, but it should be acheivable. It is really funny. People say that they don't trust any one they don't know, but they trust checkout people and opperators all the time. Just think about how much information is handed out each day between people that don't know each other. Of course we would be quite paranoid if we didn't trust any one. It just seems like we are ready to talk to some one we have never met before and never will see again more than we would talk to some one in a new class. People are overly concerned with making good impressions. It is important to realize that we are all pron to error. I say this, but I still worry about making good first impressions. I worry about it more if I think I am going to see the person again. If I don't think we will ever meet again, I am more relaxed. My mind is currently switching between a rapid pace of thoughts to blanking out. It is really scarry to think that your mind can just go blank when your not really doing any thing. I can understand your mind blanking out on a particular subject while you are trying to consentration on it, but the total lack of thought is just wierd. Oh my gosh. I just looked at the clock. I hope I have time to take a shower before the floor meeting. I have been going every where to day including a short (very short) workout at the gym. I probably smell. Not that I did that much exercise today. All the machines were full so I was only able to do two machines today. If I had been with a friend I would have stayed longer since I would have had some one to talk to in line while waiting. Athletic centers can be very intemidating places. Every one always seems to know what they are doing and seems to be in great shape. Of course, if you go to work out enough, you are going to be in shape. My back really hurts. I need to sit strait. I am always slouching over. I try to keep my back strait; it just never works for too long. I'm getting tired now. Typing is becoming harder as I become sleepier. Sleep is such an important part of my life. I probably sleep way too much, but it is better than some habbits people have. There is a consceted statement. Trying to say that I am better than some other people. Who do I think I am?  We all have are assests and faults. What time is it?  I really need to go soon. I just hope that when I get there I don't smell too bad or say my thoughts out loud. I am not saying them out loud, but typing them is very similar. The toughts must be processed to make sense and be comunicated. Writing is just a different form of comunication compared to talking. I hope I can find this place. I wish I had a friend to go with me. Large social events can be intemidating when every one seems to already know eachother. May be some of the people I met Saturday night will be there. Then I can finally figure out two of their names. It is so weird. I can remember the conversation we had, what they wore, where we were sitting, every thing but their names. I can't ask them because they remember mine. I don't want to hurt their feelings. I have to go now so I can get there on time. 
__label__label1 Realizing that I am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. Everyday, I open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and I have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. I have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now I posses all these things. And as excited as I am, I also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. Not in myself or my actions but in all I have left behind. Yes I am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but I am also talking about my childhood and innocence. Ok, go with me for a little bit--- I know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. I am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. I don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. My teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. All those thing that I took for granted but were a daily part of my life. Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom of college and the fact that I can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call  my mom if I happen to skip class. I really don't know where I'm going with this, all I can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. It's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. I am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so I don't oversleep. Yet, I should confess that so far, I am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. One thing I  certainly enjoy is the fact that I can spend more time with my friends and I can go out on weekdays and I can eat unhealthy food as much as I want. Not to say that I indulge myself in such activities constantly. I guess the point of it all, is that I am confused. I am trying to find out who I am. And I think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. Throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, I think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. Oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.  
__label__label1 It is 0:00 on Wednesday the something. I never remember the dORGNPROPNAMEMEe anymore since I quit my job this summer. I think it is the 0nd now that I think about it. Anyway, I guess I will be writing until about 0:00. that gives me a little time left over until I have to go to Psy 000 today. I wonder what the movie will be about. I really hate sitting in class for an hour and a half strait. What really stinks is that all my classes are like that. Except my Calculus discussion class. It is only 00 minutes long a day, two days a week. I just got out ORGNAME that class. My TA in there is really boring. He reminds me of a Seinfeld episode. The one with the low-talker. I don't really watch Seinfeld, but I saw that one. He is extremely dry too. He stands in front of the board when he writes, and that makes it extremely hard to see what he is doing. Sometimes he even erases stuff before the class even gets to see it at all. Some teachers just really stink like that. Other than that 000 minutes a week, my classes are going pretty good.      I have been writing for 0 minutes now. Whoever is reading this (if anyone is at all) will have to trust me. I am not an ultra fast typer, so the form might not be as long as some students, but I guess it isn't the size that counts. :-)      I am at a loss for words now. My roommate would love this assignment. He can talk forever. I have know PROPNAME (my roommate) for nearly 0 years now. It is weird that we are still friends. He is so moody all the time, I never know how to act around him. He is great and all, but it is like living with a women who is constantly having her period. Serious mood swings. He is gay, so I guess it is kind of like living with a women. I'm not gay though. Here is a question. You decide whether or not this is fair. the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME thinks nothing about letting two homosexual partners (male or female) live in the same room with one another all year. LOCNAME doesn't have one problem with that. However, they get all pissy when my girlfriend is in my dorm room after 00:00 on weekdays, and 0:00 on weekends. Tell me the logic of that. Please. Someone tell me the difference between me and PROPNAME having sex all night long (not going to happen though) and PROPNAME and I having sex all night long. Not even sex. Just sleeping in the same bed. Tell you what, not even sleeping, but just talking with one another. I am not a sexaholic yet anyway. Does that seem to bother anyone else but me?        I guess I found a few words. It is 0:00.      PROPNAME and I have been dating for nearly 0 years now. I have only had one other girlfriend in my life. We started dating in Junior High school. Man!  It hasn't even seemed like that long. We were engaged for a short period of time last year, but since then we have decided to back up to "dating" again. It was her decision really. I wanted to get married this Christmas break, but she had a change of heart. We are still going to get married, just a little farther down the road.    Well, I suppose that that is my 00 minutes of streaming. That flew by rather quickly. This was a good idea on your parts. See you all in class. PROPNAME A PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 I am moving my foot back and forth and I find that to be very reliving for me . I can't believe that the only thing keeping me for getting married is my girlfriend, is that such a big deal am I ready for all that stuff. who is the best person I can talk to that won't ever judge me, I think that it is my girlfriend. I can't believe her,  she is so rude to me when I do something that is not good as far as she is concerned. hard to believe is not it. I don't want to talk about this any more because I am not to worried about it. I have to swim in this thing some day  I use to play football for ORGNAME. I walked on my freshman year and now I don't do anything. I wish I could do something like that now not only reason to stay in shape and but also because I miss it and I want to play again. I type to slow I am very tired of it and I need to go. 
__label__label0 so there you go. my one feeling. tired. I think ill get to know that a little more as the semester goes on. and now I'm beginning to feel another emotion. that of annoyance. my roommate is talking to me about a bunch of crap while I'm trying to do this thing. I've got a dull sort of sensation in my head. I guess I've been working to hard. or maybe that could be from that lack of sleep. but then why do I want to dwell on this the whole time. can I not think of anything better to say?. that brings me to my biggest character flaw. not knowing what to say. and why the hell do I want to bring this up. I don't know. my mind wanders again as he talks somemore. I'm also beginning to feel a little overwhelmed with the college work load. I don't really think it is that much stuff. it's just that I have one class I don't like at all. that being good old rhet/comp. and how can I hate a class like that so much. I hate writing and reading. simply put. I have a strong sensation to end right here with this writing. but then that just wouldn't be right. and then I think I might be able to get something out of this. I kind of feel like I'm doing this incorrectly. seems more like a diary to me. and now the people outside the dorm room are making noise. do they ever have any freaking homework to do. at least I havent heard the bass being played way to damn loud today. the sob was playing the stuff at 0 in the moring. not that it woke me up. but I got to hear my roommate bitch about it. I kind of feel proud of myself somewhat today. I had somewhat of a social interaction with a girl. something that hasnt happened in a while. if ever. yeah. sad state of affairs for me. that brings me back to think of why I havent gone anywhere in my life with the opposite sex. I guess if I just got to being a little more social. yeah. I could fix that problem. well. at least that was a start today. now if I could just keep stuff like that up and not be so much of an introvert. I might just turn out ok. now I'm low in the well of ideas. what else to type about. am I even doing what the assignment was asking of. I remember going to the therapist while I was in middle school. she said I had to express myself. and not be afraid to feel my emotions. yada yada. I know I have emotions to feel. I guess I'm just too damn shy to show them sometime. and now I hear female voices outside. I'm kind of glad I hear them. takes my mind away from doing this. and lets me concentrate on them. I don't know why I like trying to figure out what the hell they are saying. I guess I like seeing how other people interact with one another. speaking of that. me and my roommate. we interact. just don't talk too much. we need to get the hell out of this room a little more often and meet different people. I can't force him to do anything . but I know I can maybe get myself out to do some stuff. I'm kind of pissed at the people from school that came to UT. it's almost as if they fucking ignore me. but then thats ok. I know some might be doing that just because I am with my roommate. they don't really like him much at all. I just got a little laugh hearing my roommate having computer problems. I'm really having a bad time when I have to talk about something like that. well. I'm kind of proud of myself. I was able to spend 00 minutes so far talking about almost absolutely nothing. one last thing to talk/bitch about. I like the food here at dobie. yeah. nice to know. but the fucking lines are a bitch. 0 mins remaing. go clock, go. wooh. I used a comman. I better learn to have more patcients (spelling) with the hw assignments. I always find myself watching the clock, seeing how many pages I have left, or anything else that I can use to see what kind of a pace I am on. and once I find out how slow it's going for me. I get discouraged. oh well. the clock on the computer reads 00:00. that would make 00 mins complete. 0/0 way done. lets get this over with 
__label__label0 Losing my best friend the day before classes started doesn't necessarily "enhance" my college experience. So much has been circulating through my head. Why did this happen?  She and her sister had so much to live for, and now they are both dead because of a freak accident. A careless mistake took the only two children their parents will know to be their own. In a perverted way I find the situation ironic. PROPNAME had done so many stupid things in her life and come away from them without a scratch, but her sister took a turn too fast and it took both of their lives. I find myself unable to think too much about it recently. I am able to say "my best friend just died" but I haven't found it possible to truly feel the extent of pain that I do. I find myself going through the day forcing a smile here and there, a laugh if I hear something funny, but I have never had such a consistent view of the sidewalk. I am polite to the girls in my dorm, but I am somehow furious that they don't understand my pain. I wouldn't either if someone had come to me with this situation three weeks ago. No one does until it affects you personally. It's like one of those after-school specials on teen-aged depression. I find myself shutting down sometimes and hating the world. If I believed in a god, it would only be one more person to hate and blame for this. I know I need to make new friends but can only wish to see and talk to my old friends, friends that understand. I know I need to get out and do things, but the thought of socializing with strangers frustrates the hell out of me. I find myself going through phases of denial, then rage, then depression, and then denial again. Sometimes I want to put my fist through the wall, other times I want to curl up in a little ball and just stay there for weeks. Sometimes nothing seems important. What good does it do to strive for perfection if it can all be taken away that quickly?   What good does it do to have people close to your heart, if it only hurts that much more when you lose them?  Of course I know the answers to these questions, but recently I've challenged everything I have trusted to be true. 
__label__label1 it stresses me . I this what I want to do or I am finishing something merely because I feel I have to. I think this is what I want my degree in but just maybe not what I want to do seriously. I am so much happier about my life at school already. I want to meet a good guy that I can hang out with and not worry about how I look and stupid stuff like that. I just hope it happens pretty soon. I love art now. There something so mysterious about it to me. What were they thinking?  Although I think some of it is sketchy as to call it some sort of meaningful piece but I guess it is to them. It is definitely one of those things left to the beholder. I am not sure if I buy into all this psychology stuff,  It is a little hard to follow. We'll see. Just out of curiosity, what are they going to be able to tell about me from this bit of blabber. I bet they read a lot of weird stuff. I am normal, I guess. Sometimes I am a bit complicated but in an interesting way, of course. I do stress about that. If I am to complicated for the guys I am around at school. So many of them are just existing until their next beer. Get a life. and a job. I think I am looking in the wrong place. maybe I am looking and that is my problem. It is kind of something that makes time pass. You know, waiting for the next guy, wondering what he'll be like, if you know him already, if he has a girlfriend. I am stressing that I will have to stay up too late tonight. Couldn't stay awake in class,  That bothers me. It is rude. I don't know what to say for 00 minutes. I probably won't go the whole time. I have a lot to do. I wonder what they think of me so far. Honestly what I am thinking now is not always what is on my mind so forming some sort of a synopsis is unjust. Just checked to see how much I had written. This is really boring, you know. I talk to myself all day. The last thing I wanted to do was write it down. I have to try to balance my spending every month. I have 0 weeks left and its not looking good, already. If only I had a job, I wouldn't feel so bad about asking for extra cash every month. But I don't and I do feel bad. I must go, this is driving me insane. I keep thinking about what I have to do. 
__label__label1 I want to get good grades in all my classes. My goals is to get between a 0. 0 and a 0. 0. which is really going to be hard between fraternity and classes. I really like this college and have seemed to have adjusted well. I like my roommate. He cracks me up. his little insights on lfe entertain me. tomorrow I am going to work out. I need to run. this will keep me healthy and make me feel good about myself. I have to ask a date to My fraternity function for Friday night. the girl I want to ask isn't home but hopefully will be there later. I think that she is cute, and that she might like me. I am worried about classes. I haven't been able to review all my notes. there is just too much to do in this damn town. I heard about my ex-girlfriend today. I hope I never see her again. she amde my senior year so hard. I was so upset over her. I never understood how one person can have such an effect on another person. She might come in for AC, a sammy party. I hope that she doesn't come near me, because if I'm drunk I'll probally tell her to go to hell. I mean, after all she broke my heart. I was the one who felt like shit all the time. I hope she chokes on her own food. But I don't want her to die. Professor said today that love and hate are mixed together. he is so right. I hate stacy so much, but sometimes I just love too much. I wish I could sever all ties with her--oh well shit happens. She just makes me so angry, but my anger is a sign that I haven't gottne rid of my ties to her. this assignment take a long time. I'm really tired because I have been up since 0:00 in the morning. I had to go get football tickets-yea!  I'm going to the 0st game on saturday, that will be a blast. The crowd will probally be nuts. I can't wait. This university is so cool, I just wish that there were no street people on the drag. They just sit around and smoke and ask you for change. These kids need to either go home, I hear that they choose to live that lifestyle, or become a ward of the state. I am almost tapped out. Writing my thoughts is a very hard task. it is mentally challenging. I want to go downstairs to ask out slyvia, but I dn't know if she is home, maybe ill just call alec and see. I have one more minute. My mind is almost blank because I'm so tired. This course is quite hard and I wish you would explain the concepts better. I have to go read my book. Times up. See you in class 
__label__label0 In this short amount of time I changed from a kid who major worries were only about him self. I feel that I have really grow up. I believe it was all the time that I got screwed over by my so called friends. The first time was a the first of my senior year. Well I meet this guy named PROPNAME and he was from Indian and we shared common interest. However he was new in town and did not have a girl friend. However I was dating this one girl for about year. Well This girl was very possessive, and very wealthy. Not to forget she was beautiful. During the summer I worked as a Life guard and taught swimming lesson in the mornings at her house(made tons of money) Any her family and her left for LOCNAME and had me house sit. No problem making money had a garage full of tool to work on my cars and basically had my own house. I had not friends because they all graduated A year earlier and PROPNAME had been my only friend this past year. Partially because she was so possessive. Well I meet PROPNAME at the end of the summer and became good friends. He was going to start school with us in the fall and everything was great. Until PROPNAME got home and said not more PROPNAME. She did the same thing with an early friend PROPNAME. However I finally told her either she relaxes or we break up Decision help by PROPNAME. So we broke up. So I was dating again. Before PROPNAME I had a new girl friend every two days. PROPNAME and I were dating these two girl PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Well PROPNAME and PROPNAME started dating and the only thing between Casi and I was a Physical thing so once I stop see her. PROPNAME influence PROPNAME in stop hanging out with me. Five months down the road I have and new group of friend they a grade younger than me. They have not had as much luck with the girls as I have so I am letting them meet some of my friends from out of town were a very tight group for about two months when one of the guy in the group named PROPNAME thinks I am having a sexual relationship with a girl he likes. Because she has hickeys on her neck. That same week I had really bad scratch marks on my back not from her. Well he think something is going on and starts a fight with me at school and I break his nose in front of the entire school assembly. Later next week PROPNAME girlfriend and him break up. So the next day PROPNAME is at my house. We hang out not stop for about three weeks. Fishing hunting cruising for girl everything, well Lorine wants to get back with PROPNAME so she brings out this story from way back in the past. (lorine and I were dating a long time ago)  She said that I was inviting her over to my house. Well I was, to a party so she can see PROPNAME. But she tell I so PROPNAME gets mad at me and tries to fight me. At my own house during this party. PROPNAME is a very Muscular guy and very big!!!!. Well I talk it out after we both have black eyes and we have not been close since. Anyway I now dating this really nice sweet girl who is very intelligent and pretty. I just hope it stays as good as it is now. 
__label__label0 Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in LOCNAME for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to ORGNAME and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 00000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 00 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new PROPNAME PROPNAME CD for dad tomorrow and call PROPNAME. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named PROPNAME. Never eat at a place called PROPNAME's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      
__label__label0 Today I had a very fun (sarcastic) schedule, I worked out and also participated in my ORGNAME drill team, which I am a part of. My thoughts are nothing but satisfaction, a vigorous week of PT (physical training), academics, drill, and discipline have finally ended for three glorious days to elapse. Yes, just another three days or so, then it's back to the normal vigorous routine. My feelings for joining the NROTC unit is my decision, the option to choose the path to become a ORGNAME ORGNAME commissioned officer is brave for my part. For the past week, PT has been vigorous and I sometimes find myself out of shape for the activities. My ankle, which has a long history of spraining, is not helping either. My Gunnery Sergeant and my Staff Sergeant and I agreed that the Leathernecks, the "ORGNAME ORGNAME" part of the team, will help me get up to standards, after all, the Leathernecks and the entire unit looks after its own. Looks after it's own. I want to be part of the team, a part of the unit, a player, a leader, not a manager, not a weakling, nor any of that. I want to prove that I am someone. That I am a human being, someone worthy of being respected and liked. I have had a couple of bad experiences before I reported to LOCNAME. One was that I broke up with my girlfriend for the summer. She and I, even though we liked each other, found out that we were 'incompatible' and the separation of college (me going to UT, she going to U of H) would only make things worse. Sometimes we would find ourselves arguing over something as petty as 'who left the door open?'. It was a bad experience and the breakup just before college hit me like a MACK truck, just like all my bad experiences before. After my breakup, I wonder whether I should date again. There's a nice girl (I won't name her name or how I know her) around that I know but I don't know if I should get to know her more. Maybe it's because I had a bad history of dating, and I sometimes wonder if I would take the circle path back to where I started, broken up and feeling depressed about myself. This girl, I like her a lot, and I  think she thinks I'm ok, but I don't know if she really likes me. To take another risk like that will probably leave me either being shunned my rejection or being depressed by another break up. That's why I must concentrate on other things. My priority is to the team, and I will work as much as I can to get my unit up and running. I am in the pistol and the drill team and I want to learn more and know more. Also, I want to get a 0. 0 ORGNAME, so I can get a scholarship from my unit. PT has been tough, I find myself being killed by the active duty Marines when we PT, but I can't quit. My ankle had me forced to drop out of the runs two times, but I won't quit the program. I cannot quit, and I will not quit. To quit will put me forever in disgrace as a quitter who couldn't 'hack it' and also in the shun of my teammates, who I left them high and dry by letting them down. To quit would also to put me down further into the downward spiral of depression. To quit is out of the question. I will keep on going no matter what happens and I will do anything that has to be done to pass. I will not fail.                 
__label__label1 I am thinking about my roommate who got the wrong book for his Japanese class and didn't realize it till he tried to do his homework last night, he had to get up this morning and drive to get the book and try to do the four pages in the book that were assigned for homework before class started. He is crazy, he and I always get into trouble like that. We've known each other since elementary school and have had some great times. One time I remember we were studying for a chemistry test our sophomore year in high school, it was really late so we decided to go to the store and get some jolt cola to help us stay awake. I ended up backing my truck into the ditch in front of the store and we were stuck. We sat there forever trying to get my truck out of the ditch and then finally I called another one of my friends who had a four runner. He took us to ORGNAME and we bought a tow strap. We  went back to the ditch and hooked our two cars up together. He then tried to pull my truck out and his tires just spun around and around. So I had to accelerate and my roommate had to push my truck from behind, by the time we got my truck out of the ditch it was like 0 so we were way to tired to study, so we  went to bed and failed the chemistry test. I ended getting a 00. 0 in chemistry and being moved to the academic class because of 0/00 of a point. If it was for  my roommate coming up with the great idea of going to get jolt cola in the middle of the night I might have been able to stay in chemistry honors, but even if that was the case I would much rather have that memory than an extra point on my high school gpa. My roommate and I now live in a two story townhouse that is 0000 square feet. We got a really good deal on it because the week before school started the apartment complex we preleased with called and said that had no apartments left for us even though we preleased 0 months ago. We had to drive to LOCNAME and look for  a new place that weekend and while we were here we stopped by the leasing office and talked to the people there, they said that someone cancelled on a townhouse and that since we had to go through all this trouble we could have it for almost the same price we were going to pay for and apartment about 0/0 the size. We got so excited and I am really glad things worked out like they did because I don't think I could live in a small apartment cause I need  a lot of space or I go crazy too much space makes me crazy too but only when there is no one to share it with. But our townhouse is just the right size and its nicely furnished because both of my parents have been  divorced and remarried so there is a lot of furniture that no one uses, so I got some pretty nice stuff. There aren't many decorations in the townhouse but there are lots of dishes and silverware. I took my stepmom's couches which really surprised me because I didn't think that she would let me have them because sometimes she is strange but I guess she can be pretty understanding sometimes. I used to hate her but now I realize that she really does want the best for me and only gets frustrated cause she raised her kids differently than my dad raised me. 
__label__label1 This comp science lab is pretty nice and I'm kind of confused about what to say or do here. I mean I've been thinking about all this stuff lately and now that I come to write stuff down nothing really comes to mind except filler, you know, the kind of random thoughts you think that don't really mean much at all, I mean look at this thing I'm typing right now!  I didn't make the band but that's ok I guess more time for Geology 000 and PROPNAME isn't in it either so its all good. I want to go swing dancing tonight but PROPNAME isn't there (well and PROPNAME's line is busy so its kind of bunk) cause I take the bus, but it doesn't run as late as I'll be out.  Anyway. Um well lets see I guess I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm like thinking and stuff. Actually I'm wondering if anyone will ever read this, so I'm somewhat apprehensive: I've been thinking some pretty damn personal stuff lately so I don't really want to broadcast on the World Wide freaking Web. I also just typed a profanity and replaced it with a euphemism. I guess that's in case someone actually reads this too. PROPNAME. Hehehe that was cryptic, wasn't it??  See I'm kind of giving a vague notion here. I just type what I think. So there you have it. Wow Five minutes and my wrist feels funny. the FAC Typing things. keyboards, I mean. they aren't very ergonomic if you know what I mean and the surface of the desk kind of hurts. Replace Keyboard. Well it looks like PROPNAME is getting into this assignment, too. which is really kind of cool when I think about it. It will be interesting to me to actually go back and read the thing, cause I'm always editing what I write but now I'm just kind of going forward. relax. I don't know let me see well I'm kind of hungry, isn't that like part of the Id?  I always heard about that-- you know, along with Superego and stuff hey check it out I just read the instructions while I was typing that line and I didn't even miss any keys. Not bad eh?  This is kind of odd for me in another way, too  because I'm a Linguistics Major and well see I know most of the stuff they teach in 000 already, but the Professor seems cool enough. No more high school. Ten minutes to go. Living at home is ok. I can take the metro bus. PROPNAME is cracking up. If you read his (That's "Kay, PROPNAME") you probably shouldn't count it as much cause I can hear him stop typing to re-read what he already wrote and that's not ver continuous, now is it?  I hope I have enough money for food this week. $00 has to last me. I hat this space bar it sucks a lot. You have to hit it real no really hard just to make it go. see what I mean??  I hate it when people use adjectives instead of the proper adverbs. How hard is it to put on a little anyway?    My generation doesn't care, I guess. She's so smart. In fact she went to PROPNAME when she was a Junior in High School. Damn it I get mad just picturing her somewhere else having fun with someone else. But its cool I don't have to worry. or so I say. how could someone so Awesome be alone for long?   No no no. I only see her once a week. It will never work. Okay. well no I'm better. I didn't mean to go all mushy, in fact I'm thinking about going back and deleting that stuff. you know, in the name of science and all. Isn't that weird how I use the second person?  As if I actually expect it to enhance readability or something!  I guess I'm trying to make this whole thing like a VERY one sided conversation. Click click goes the happy little keyboard. My fedora is on the table. I learned the other day that its a PROPNAME Hat from LOCNAME and not really a fedora but its all good because I still think it looks good. People think I'm funny wearing a fedora all the time, but I don't care. They can just piss off. I get lots of ORGNAME ORGNAME jokes. Loss. I'm at a loss here. Ever since that paragraph where I talked about her it got all funky and now its happening again. No. I have a striped shirt on that's white and burnt orange but nobody said anything. I guess that's ok but I thought it was really nifty. 00 minutes seems like a long time at first but then I guess when you get to the end of it its not really  WELL DAMN PROPNAME is looking at my screen, that bastard. I had to stop typing for a sec to make him look away. I guess he didn't see anything deeply embarrassing. rrHahahah  Well times up. I want my cookie. 
__label__label0 to tell you the truth I really have now idea what to say. So. I guess the easiest thing to do to make the 00 mins. pass as quickly possible is to tell you all about myself. Where to start??? Well. I was born in LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME in the Clinic B Hospital. To my fellow PROPNAME's I am also known as a "clinic B Baby. "  I am, however, not the slightest bit Saudi even though the experience has had a wonderful and great impact on my life. What brought my parents, PROPNAME and PROPNAME, to LOCNAME in the 0st place was the huge amount of oil. My father is a geologist and a graduate of ORGNAME. My parent's have been visiting me here in LOCNAME and are leaving tomorrow back to Saudi:-(  I'm used to the good-byes though so although I am quite sad it is something that I have learned to get used to. I attended a little all girls boarding school in LOCNAME, LOCNAME for the past 0 years so I guess my transition went quite a but smoother than that of my fellow Freshmen. Well. I am getting bored of talking about myself so I guess I'll move on to something else.       I just returned from LOCNAME's caving society meeting. It was BY FAR the most interesting experience of my day. Well. to begin. there were no other UT students from the looks of things excluding the friends that I went with. Instead I ran into a TON of my parents old family friends. My parents met while caving with the UT club in LOCNAME AGES ago and my uncle ORGNAME was the famous old president of the Club ages ago and discovered some huge cave in LOCNAME. I had know idea what I was getting myself into when I happened to see a little flyer about the meeting and am so excited about caving in the near-by future. This weekend I'm going camping with my sister, PROPNAME, and we're supposed to do some caving while we are there so I'm psyched! Only 0 more day to go!  Bye! 
__label__label1 I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 0 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading "Reader friendly material"  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 00 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in LOCNAME)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 00th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. PROPNAME just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! 
__label__label0 I live in LOCNAME and I can't exactly drive home to see them. I envy the people in my dorm who only live a few hours away from home. They can visit their friends and family on every weekend or weekday for that matter. I feel a little guilty because I miss my friends more than I miss my family. Maybe that is because I had a better relationship with my friends than I did with my family. this is probably because I spent a lot more time with my friends during the past few years. It seemed I felt empty if I didn't see my friends for a day, but I could go weeks without seeing my family and I'd feel just fine. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, and I do feel slightly homesick, but I have a stronger relationship withe my friends. Whenever I spent "quality time" with my folks, all we would do would sit on the couch in the living room and watch Seinfeld; we would never talk, but it really wasn't their fault. Whenever I would feel like talking about something important that was on my mind, they wouldn't have a problem with it, but I would feel awkward. It has always been that way, so it's not some kind of "teenager" thing that just kind of happened during my rebellious years. My parents are the greatest, and so are my three brothers. I have one older brother that is about to turn 00, so the age difference is pretty narrow. We used to do things all the time when we were younger, but now we hardly talk at all. I also have two younger brothers, 0 and 00 who are also great, but they're not so easy to talk to. My brother, PROPNAME, who is 00, has a lot of problems I think. He doesn't have any friends and he always just stays home and watches tv and plays video games. When I ask him how his day was, he just says fine, and thats all the conversation really consists of. I couldn't really talk to him because I felt so sorry for him. I also worry about my mom because she loses sleep trying to find ways to help him. My youngest brother, on the other hand, has plenty of energy and self-confidence and a lot of friends. I think he'll be one of the "popular guys" in school, and I feel bad when my little 0 year old brother can outdo my 00 year old brother PROPNAME. I also try to think up ways to raise PROPNAME's self confidence, but I'm really not much of a help. I find myself making fun of him unconciosly just like many big brothers all do, but I really feel bad about it. I sometimes know how he feels because in junior high I didn't always have five or ten friends to hang out and talk with, and I sometimes found myself at home on the weekends feeling like a loser, but I eventually found my place and my friends in high school, and I hope that's what he does when he goes to high school next year. He is old for his grade because he was held back in the first grade, and he has some kind of a learning problem and when I try to help hime with his school work he gets embarrassed and won't let me. I just really hopes he finds his place in high school or if not, in college, like many people do. so, maybe I should spend more time with my family when I get home in a few monthes instead of with my friends 
__label__label1 So much needs to be done within the next two days, it seems practically impossible to get it done. I have to write these two essays, redo the entire freaking' pretesting crap just because I completed 00% of it and then when it kicked me off, it didn't even save it although I was informed otherwise. So, frankly, I'm disturbed by a lot of things. I have a journalism test tomorrow morning, which, by the way, I haven't studied for, and tonight I had a presentation for ORGNAME, a service organization I would like to join if, in the midst of all this chaos called "college", I can somehow find the time for a decent social life. So this "stream of conscience" theory is going to be more of a "PROPNAME needs to vent" period, because frankly, that is all that is on my mind. I had a crappy day, and I don't expect writing this will help me all that much, but I'll go ahead and say what happened. Some egotistical freak from the male species grabbed my ass today while I was one of the many cross walks on this large campus. Granted I hyper-extended is wrest, at worst I broke it, I would like to request respect from the gender that so frequently asks the inevitable question "why"  when the finger always points to them!!  It was freaking' hot outside all day, and running from class to class always makes it oh so much cooler!!  And the whole idea of college is running through me now when I have deadlines for tests, papers, and self-indulgent pompous professors who think they know the answer to the world, and what's even scarier than that is that WE pay to wake up at 0 AM to go to their lectures and believe the handfuls of bullshit they try to feed us. (I was making a generalization about the professor part of course, some lectures are actually stimulating. )  To top it off, somewhere in the midst of all of this mumbling jumble of chaotic words, I feel almost depressed tonight. I met a guy at the ORGNAME organization meeting mentioned before, and I REALLY like him, and I heard that he was interested, but I haven't seen him in six days, and I honestly think that he could actually calm me from this feeling of intense pressure. If I could just see him I would relax and then take a different view on all the crap that I still have to do. I guess I just need him right now, and the longer I go before I see him again, the more distant and hopeless I feel toward him. I guess you can say I've been lulled into inertia by my subconscience feelings to see him. Anyway, my twenty minutes of rambling has come to an end, so it was great venting and I hope, in some weird way, this has satisfied your requirements and calmed your thoughts and revelations about the stream of conscience in a frustrated, tired, and ticked off college student. 
__label__label0 I don't really know what I should write about. I guess I'm feeling alright. My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 0. 0 ORGNAME for 0 and 0/0 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night. 
__label__label1 for some reason I just don't find a hairy chest on a guy that asthetically pleasing, but if I shave will it grow back much thicker, there is only one way to find, I used to shave my legs in high school for sports and I don't have thick black hair now. I know this much if I were to shave my chest I would use the new mach three from gillette. for some reason , I have such an infatuation with this new razor over the past week since I bought it. I usually get razor burn no matter what I do before or after I shve, but with mach 0 I put it to the test and I didn't even get a scratch. I read something that said it was designed to make you want to get up at two in the morning and shave, I wouldn't take it that far but it is definatly a great razor, my frien just read his list of goals for the futrure to me as I was writting this, and one of them was to travel and see dave for a year, dave mathews, I couldn't agree more. what is it about his music that is so unbelievable, sometimes his lyrics don't make sense, but the whole band is so musically inclined and can just jam and do things at the drop of a hat that most other bands can't do, they just know each other so well. I looked at the clock and it hasn't been 00 minutes yet, come to think about I don't really sit around with a lot of things on my mind,  I am in a house with five guys so usually there is someone to talk to someone to talk to some one to talk to some one to talk to , no one to talk to right now and even if there was I couldn't because I can't type and talk at the same time I would type what I was talking or talk what I was writing, whatever, how can drummers carry on so many different beats at the smae time, somethimes two with their feet and two with their hands while singinglyrics, amazing, I play a little guitar , but when I try to strum and sing I get thrown off, not comfortable enough with the guitar yet though, I probably never will be though, I just got interupted and my train of thought  was ruined but I guess it isn't important, I think that assigments like this are interesting. not so much for the researcher but for the person writing. like me, I never really thought about what I think about. This is forcing me to do that. I am scared that the weather will never get back to normal- why wont it be cold where it is supposed to be cold?  I have a friend in LOCNAME and he says that it did not snow there at all this winter, what is that?  Another thing that worries me is anal people?  Didn't Freud study those kind of people. One of the guys I live with is so anal that it hurts me to watch him worry about all of his stuff. He asked me today if I knew what happened to two of his hot dog buns and he asked me the other day if I knew if someone drank any of his milk because he noticed that someone had moved it. I don't know what is more sad about that. that he noticed or that he cared. I think that we should bring him in and study him for our class. What can we do with this kind of illness kind of thing- you know what I mean. That may have to be an entire unique number of its own- "upper division standing required" if you know what I mean. I am collecting loose change, it sits in a clear glass jar next to my monitor- I would guess that I have about 00 dollars in right now- you can't have a dime. 
__label__label1 I often wonder why I put so much effort into such trivial things such as looks because that can only do so far. I'm not happy with myself a lot and I run from my problems and it seems co dependence is necessity for me. college has been a wake up call and a sobering realization of how small we are. PROPNAME PROPNAME wrote in a speech something along the lines of "we as humans are not afraid that we can't shine but we are afraid the of the things that we can do. any I feel like the catcher in the rye writing like this . it's so random my girl sent me a tape of songs to remember her by and they are supposed to sooth but instead they keep me up because I have such vivid memories of her. I worry about not being successful and being surpassed by my friends and that they will forget about me. I moved to LOCNAME in the middle of the summer and I was so depressed and I would look at myself and I hated the state of mind I was in and the negativity I was supporting and it was a ridiculous waste of time. I vow to make the place I'm at the best place. I bitch about so many things that are so trivial. there was an airplane crash the other day and everyone died . I can't help but think about how bad it is for those families and friends and here I was missing mine but they are certainly not dead. the people who have been directly affected by it are immersed in some tough times, and for me life is good. it's crazy how things work like that. I tried keeping a journal ,but I can't keep up with it very well so far, I can't wait to play lacrosse ,it has become such a big part of my life. every morning I wake always wishing I could sleep , but at night I always stay up, I wonder if a good philosophy to live life by is to say live everyday like the next day you going to get hit by a bus. it interests  me to talk to my parents and older adults to ask what they would have done differently if they could go back because it makes you realize how fast life goes by. my dad was so smart and I feel so much pressure to live up to him but he would kill me if he knew some of the things I've done, sometimes I feel ashamed but on the other end it is learning from mistakes. well this was interesting , I can't wait till the weekend, till christmas and till Tuesday when lacrosse starts.      
__label__label1 K. , now I'm writing, but I'm actually kind of confused about what to do. I never really had an assignment such as this one. I feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so I guess I feel some what good right now. I feel excited about school because I finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. I guess my hopes are kind of high right now. I was also excited about your class since I nearly did not get in. At first, the class was closed and so I gave up until I peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after I added your class. I also feel kind of stressed because I'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. On top of all of this I am now taking more hours this semester than I have ever had, so I guess I have my work cut out for me this year. I am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, I feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if I have now surpass the 00 minute mark or not. Nope, still got quite a bite of time left. So, lets see what else I feel. I also feel somewhat lonely because I had to leave my family and friends at home. Even though I have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. My goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 0. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. I like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. I found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. Confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. So, I hope that's ok. Part of the confusion I feel is because of this class. I went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now I had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if I'm allowed by the computer. Ah, my time is almost up and I'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. Alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone. 
__label__label1 THE FUNNY THING IS HE DOESN'T SEEM VERY WORRIED ABOUT IT. I HAVE A CALCULUS TEST THURSDAY AND I'M REALLY SCARED! IT is MY FIRST TEST AND ITS MY HARDEST CLASS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THERE. THIS FRUSTRATES ME BECAUSE USUALLY I'M VERY GOOD AT MATH. I'M HOPEFULLY GOING TO GET TUTORED BEFORE THE TEST. WALKING AROUND CAMPUS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO ME . THERE IS ALL THESE PEOPLE SWARMING AROUND EVERYWHERE ,EACH ONE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT. IT SCARES ME BECAUSE I FEEL AS THOUGH I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE. IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS VERY EASY TO BE NOTICED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL ONLY HAD ABOUT 0,000 PEOPLE IN IT. I WAS INVOLVED IN MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS, BUT I AM THE ONLY ONE OUT OF MY GROUP OF FRIENDS TO BE HERE. IT STILL SEEMS VERY WEIRD TO ME. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL THIS PRESSURE TO SUCCEED HERE FROM MY PARENTS. ITS LIKE 'DON'T SCREW UP' IS CONSTANTLY GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. MY PARENTS SEEM TO BE WAITING FOR ME TO SCREW UP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER . WELL, GOT TO GO DO MORE ASSIGNMENTS. ------    
__label__label0  I feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. I know I'm supposed to write about what I am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. I don't usually tell anyone how I am really feeling ever. I'm worried that I might not be studying as much as I should be. I don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. I mean I know I could read the texts, but I really don't think that would do me any good since I have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. I hate math. I don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. He is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. I don't think I'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. I miss my boyfriend a lot. He is going to school in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I'm not going to see him for at least three more months. I tried living with him in El Paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. I was going to go to school with him, but I decided to move back to LOCNAME because we were starting to hate each other and I missed my family a lot also. It's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. I really don't understand it at all. I wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. I know I need him and he needs me, and I really hate it. I have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but I know the truth even though I would never admit it to even my closet friends. I wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. She was so excited when she got hired. I really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what I am thinking. I mean who really cares anyway?  People are always asking you how you feel, but I'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. I know lots of times I ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. I hate when people look at me in queer ways. I always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. I wish I didn't care, but I do. 
__label__label0 college is amazing. my room, roommate, suitemates are all amazing. however, that call home always does it. I'm so in love yet my dad has to bring me down. I understand I'm only 00 and that they're thousands of fish in the sea, however, I'm in love with this one. I know I am because when I'm with her I'm the happiest man alive. yet at the moment, my feelings are so far removed from her. I understand that this is my father in my brain and my rational thinking has overcome my emotional side. he says not to let her visit, however, I must see her. he will not stop my but he's trying to open me up to the thousands of women here at ORGNAME. I don't know, I think about it every day. she's different then the girls I've ever been with. I guess, she's different then the girls my parents want me to be with. she is poor and has nothing to offer, yet I'm so in love. and I know. never have I felt this way for a girl before in my life. I would do anything for her, I mean. this assignment of writing for 00 minutes is nothing. I could sit here for 00 hrs weighing the pros and cons and just keep writing. its not  a difficult task. she is not causing me to be depressed. you know?  how people can sometimes get all depressed over their long distance relationships and stress out. I am eating like a madman as always. going out at night, WITH GIRLS, and partying. you know?  I get my homework done and study hard. I work out, pledge my freaking frat and play lacrosse. I'm doing everything and performing well for me as well as my parents so why the fuck can't I just be allowed to have the one woman in life that makes me happy. I understand that I'm young, yet this relationship is not difficult for me. its the second time I've ever been in a long distance relationship. the first one was a bust and I vowed to never do it again. so this past summer  I went to camp sabra at the lake of the ozarks to be a counselor. well, I wasn't intending on meeting anyone, however, I believe 000% that that word called 'fate' has true meaning. the first day we hit it off. I wasn't intending on anything. all I wanted to do was have a productive summer and come to ORGNAME free of love. however, you can't control love when it is real. it just happened. and I don't regret however I sometimes wonder if I didn't have her, what life for me would be like. I mean, I'm with all my buddies. they don't have girl friends or anything coming into UT and its not like they've all of a sudden found someone. I understand its only the first week, but I truly believe that what I've shared with this gorgeous somewhat deprived southern belle from LOCNAME is impossible to ever experience with anyone else. of course I could experience love with another baby, but do I really want too?  I mean, there is no way that the things we have been through together can ever be replayed. I know deep down inside that I am in love with this girl. its tough because she's not here. but what if she was here?  lets say she ends up going to UT or acc, as talked about next year?  what if my girlfriend is here dad?  what if she lives in LOCNAME?  then what, I mean I've got a girlfriend at school now, right?  its not like this is killing me. or maybe it is. look, I'm in love. I know I am. with my love, I have no worries whatsoever. I don't think about anything else when I'm with her. I'm completely content. so get off me. I'm planning on keeping my studies up the whole year, I've signed with a wonderful fraternity, I'm playing lacrosse for the university of Texas-Austin. I have an active social life. not to brag, you know. but I'm doing everything a college boy should be doing: I'm enjoying myself, and to let this get in the way is ridiculous. one must understand, this situation is not in the way. its not holding me back from talking to other girls. however, I do not become intimate with these ladies. so what?  I'll be fine, I will see my love when we visit. I just don't understand. its very stressful, but I'm handling it. you see, my older brother went through the same kind of shit, but he screwed up. he wasn't able to function and messed around freshmen year in college and ended up on academic probation. I thought, damn what if that happens to me?  but its not a worry. I'm at college, its awesome, and I'm doing just fine. we're not holding on to each other. we are in love and have so many dreams we want to fulfill. its not like I'm crying all day to my buddies that I missed her. I rarely ever do that. I'm 000% functional. you know?  I don't know, I really don't know what the hell I just spattered out. I'm in love g-d damn-it. and I'm happy. I just have to relax and get my father's controlling voice removed from my head. I hope I fulfilled the assignment. its been 00 minutes of continuous writing. guess what, my mind still tells me I'm in love. ain't that the darndest thing. alright, time to go ponder. maybe I'm relieved now. see you. 
__label__label0 I lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her I started to miss her. I had attempted to email her but she never responded, I guessed that she was mad at me. I have emailed her 0 times with no reply but I am a persistent bastard so finally today, in fact just before I opened this page I decided to check my email as I do every day and there was her email. it explained that she had not checked her email all summer, it may not be true but it works for me. I proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around 00 minutes. I will eagerly await her reply as I basically demanded to see her. We'll see if she accepts. I never checked to see when I started this but I will keep on writing until I run out of shit to say. I assume that cursing is not a problem, I understand that this is a class full of naive little freshmen but I think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities, don't worry I wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and I am an avid cusser so I hope this will do (that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing). now I am running out of things to say. I like most of my classes. my major is biochemistry. I am 00 years old. I have brown hair blue eyes,  I like to play football watch football,  OPENING DAY IS SUNDAY!  I live for football actually,  I like movies, I am filling in space. this is odd and I am going to stop now. thank you kent 
__label__label0 so far this class seems alright. I means the girls in this class look pretty good. there's this one girl in there, I haven't talked to her yet but I have to because she 's always looking at me. she looks pretty cute, but I can tell she is young. there's this other Hispanic girl  who has real tight curly hair . she looks incredible. shit all the girls in there do well who ever is reading this can probably tell hat I think about sex a lot. its strange because I always find myself daydreaming about having a wife and kids, you know having a real family. going to visit y folk and other friends with my kids. but it like no how hard I try, after I have sex with a lady, I just lose total respect for them, I just look at there flaws and I only look at the negative. with me, the way I think about a girl is totally different after we engage in hot intense intimacy. some times I don't know if it is just irrational thought processes or what. I know its not normal. but what is normal. normal is what society says is ok. but who is the society, whites blacks Hispanic, the melting pot of the us. or the world. there are so many different cultures and societies that essayist that who is to say that their ways are better then anybody else's. how can you say that is right and that is wrong because society deems it that way. if society is forever changing, are our moral standards to be forever changing as well. well it has been so far in our human history.         times up, nice talking with you 
__label__label1 I never thought that college would be this overwhelming. I went to three classes today and I went ho0me and cried. How can I keep up with everything?  I went through Band Week and I sometimes ask myself is band worth it. When I am tired and sweating and just want to go home, I think of my parents and how they can brag in my little home town and the feelings of walking through the tunnel at the game and see 00,000 plus fans. At home 0,000 was the biggest turn out and that was big enough. I am very nervous about the first game. Where I am from our school marches military and LOCNAME marches more corps. I just know that I am going to mess up. I am all excited about school only being thirteen weeks long but fear that one and a half years of high school work equivalency are jam packed into these thirteen weeks. Good news though. I only have two finals. That is marvelous. I have to take a dumb SAT II test Thursday from 0-0pm and that means that I may miss band which I cannot. I don't see why someone who had five years of math in high school ()algebra in 0th which was a high school course offered for GT) has to take a stupid test. If I wasn't good in math I wouldn't have had five years of it and passed nor would I be an engineering major. Who knows. I called the department of mathematics and asked them about it. I tried to get a number so my teacher could call and try to see of something could be worked out and they were extremely rude to me. So I called the measurements and evaluations \center and they told me to call the department of mathematics. My teacher said " welcome to UT"  This is a wonderful idea to have a writing assignment of continual thought because I can just vent about the worst first day of class I have ever had in my entire life. I have strong feelings that it will get better because it cannot get worse. I know that the first semester is the hardest but right know I don't care. While I was studying,  I was thinking about the kids that went off to college and came back at Christmas and visited about their first semester at school. Everything they said doesn't' pertain to me. Nothing they said pertained to me. I thought about what I would say if I was ever asked to speak about my first semester at college. My Calculus teacher stressed \over and over how we need to take the AP test. He said that we would slack off because we already knew it. For me I need this semester review. I love math and work hard at it. It doesn't come easy to me but I love it and no matter how hard something is if you love it you will work your darndest at it to achieve the highest possible. So I was thinking about if my calculus teacher asked me to come to his class what I would say if someone asked me why I didn't the AP test and if it were a smart decision, ( that was my cat walking across the key board. )  He wants outside because he knows that there are other cats outside and he wants to attack them. He's a 00 week orange tabby cat named Bevo-talk about school spirit. I think that I would answer the AP question as one that it is a personal decision. My boyfriend AP out of 000C and said that was the worst thing he did. Some people are happy they did. Another guy from home AP out of 00 hours and went to M&A and came home because he failed everything but PE. My \philosophy is that I need to start from the beginning in order to get used to things. ,  So what if I have already gone over this in high school I don't care. Why make things hard on myself with new material my first semester it's not like I'm going to graduate in 0 years anyway. I figured that if I took my basic chemistry and calculus things I know that I could get used to teaching styles college life and testing style. I will have to study and I know this real well, but It won't be all new to me. Well I started at 00:00 and it's 00:00. ,  I do have one question though,  if we participate in more than five hours of experimental stuff for our semester requirement can we get extra credit for that extra hour(s)? That's all folks. Good-bye and Good luck. 
__label__label1 Well today is my birthday and I am excited. I turn 00. I am no longer just 00 and not quite 00 but somewhere in the middle. Today, I go up at 00:00 in the afternoon. I hate having to wake up so late because my day feels as if it is half gone. I guess that is why I'm here in the computer lab trying to complete these assignments. I am a little disappointed in myself because this assignment was originally due on Friday, but because some people were having difficulty with the computers the deadline was extended to Monday. That is great. I felt awkward because I had not completed the assignment not because I had computer problems but because I was to lazy to do the assignment. I have one problem I think in life and that is that I have too many friends. That seems like a weird thing to say, but it is true. I came to LOCNAME with not one single friend or any family up here and for some reason I have many friends. I ask my friend PROPNAME, do I look like a people-person, because people are just coming up to me and wanting to be my buds. I think that is so great. Most people would usually get very nervous and would not try to continue an conversation with complete strangers, but I try. Once you make the effort to reach put to people you will realize that there is a lot of people wanting to be your friend. I did something in the cafeteria the other day. I was running a way different schedule than my other friends, so I went to the cafeteria alone. I was thinking to myself, great I have to just eat and not talk to anyone. I was not going to do that so I say this guy sitting by himself. He looked decent and it wasn't as if I had any physical attraction to him. I just sneezed right now, two times. No one said bless you. I just thought that was weird. Any was back to my story. I went and sat down with him and we ate dinner together. It turns out that he is from LOCNAME LOCNAME also. wow  So I see him every now and then and we say hi to each other. I know this guy, his name is Carlitos. His is the coolest. Everywhere we go he knows someone. He goes to school at ORGNAME but he knows people at LOCNAME and ORGNAME. I want to be someone who has friends everywhere. I have been doing a successful job so far, considering that I'm a freshman. I really like it here at LOCNAME. I am making friends, doing reasonably well in my classes, I have an easy job at the MIC in the ORGNAME. To me the ORGNAME is a great building and I talk about it everyone should know but everyone doesn't know about it and I think that is interesting. A building designed to help students and many don't know about it. I understand that the freshman don't know about it but  professors and upperclass students don't know about the SSB. My hands are tired of typing and I have 0 minutes left to write. I like this psy class except that I want to fall asleep in the class. I probably should of scheduled the class for an earlier time. actually I that I think about it I did try but PROPNAME was not working to my favor so I stayed with that time. I hope I get accepted to do the experiments because I surely do not want to do a research project. Tonight we plan on drinking some beer and having some pizza for my birthday. Last night when the clock struck 00:00 midnight, my best friend from school poured beer on me. We also dropped ashes from each others cigarette into each others beer and drank it. That is our new tradition we will carry on for years. PROPNAME is a great friend. I wish she would come to UT instead of     ORGNAME, I know she wants to . well time is up so BYE.    
__label__label1 I am very tired bc I have been studying all day for various classes. I know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. This semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. I can't believe that I am having to take these evening classes I much rather have my 0:00 classes so that I could go to work and make some money now I don't what I am going to do. I guess become a male escort ha ha. I guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. Alsoo on my mind is the fact that I am kind of seeing 0 girls. I find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. Neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now I am broke all I have to offer is my heart. I don't know bc about 0 weeks ago I was pretty much dateless and desperate and now I am seeing these two girls and I have two others wanting to go out sometime. This sucks because they are all great girls and I don't want to hurt either of them. But I can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. It always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when I start dating somebody seriously I suddenly become attractive again. I am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. Man once again this sucks!!!   what else am I thinking about GRADUATING. I am tired of the school life I want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. Then again what am I talking about I am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks I get. If I didn't have conscience I would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. No money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. Why can't my parents be rich. I wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. I just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am I going to pay the bills. And day in and day out I see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. But do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted?  One can only wonder but I would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. But I guess like my dad said "son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. "  Hes not a educated man by any means but I believe he is right on this matter. For that reason I keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. Now that I have rambled on for 00 minutes I am signing off. 
__label__label1 I feel nervous inside and butterflies keep flying around my chest. This is probably because I am nervous about what my boyfriend has to tell me. I feel excited as well and it's pretty weird, but for the first time, in a long time, I know what it means to take advantage of ones individual strength. I mean I feel as though things will work out, but what if he tells me that the one and a half years we've spent together are over. Anyway, this has pretty much been on my mind since 0:00a. M. I can't really think of anything else but that. Gosh, I am so nervous, but then again I'm probably over reacting. Other things has also been on my mind like my first test in biology. I really don't know what kind of questions are going to be asked. I'm sorry, but I just feel so nervous and I think these butterflies have turned into bats or something because I can't even breathe without feeling more nervous by the minute. I feel pretty confident and I guess that's good. I guess I'll stop thinking about that for awhile and let my heart catch up to my chest pounding. On to another thing I was thinking about. I can't believe that PROPNAME guy from the ORGNAME almost beat the record foe the most homeruns. Pretty weird that I jumped from one serious subject to another, huh?  That's pretty much the way I work inside. I get all worked up about something and then the next minute I'm laughing and having a good time. I know why that happens. I don't look at the bad things in life, I only look at the good things. It's bad for me to say, but I could probably walk down a dark street with no common sense and think that that street is the most safest place on the face of this earth. A lot of people judge a lot of things from the outside which is so unfair to everyone. Not everything that looks ugly or dirty is bad. In fact, the prettiest looking and the wealthiest looking people probably do more crime or illegal things what the "middle or lower" class would do. That's why I hate when I get my pay check and see how much taxes I pay for people to just claim welfare for something stupid. More than half of the on welfare are able to work, they're just too lazy!  I know this for a fact because my boyfriend's step-sister does that. So, basically, while I'm working my ass off for people like her, my money is lost and I don't even get that much taken out of my check for MY Medicare. That's what's so unfair!! Well my 00minutes have flown by so, I will write to you soon for assignment #0. good-bye and take care. 
__label__label1 But I guess I'm supposed to be trying new things here in college. What's on my mind right now is the question at hand. So I would say right now I am thinking most about what's going on with me socially. I feel like I keep meeting all these girls and I know I'm never going to become more than friends with any of them. People tell me I'm too much of a nice guy and not aggressive enough when it comes to getting girlfriends. But who  really knows what anyone else is thinking or what another person wants. I for one have no clue what other people want from a friend or what a girl would be looking for in me but I guess that's the mystery of life. But it sure seems weird how other people seem to have things all figured out. Like my suite mate gabe, I mean he doesn't have to do anything  and everyone is like I want to be your friend and girls are like please have sex with me. I have a lot of friends but Its like I really want one girl to be more and I can't seem to get from being  friends with a girl to more but maybe its because I haven't met the girl I want to be more than friends with, oh but that's bull shit cause I know I've met plenty of very attractive girls that I would love to get with but never have. but what can I do. It also seems like some weird forces of nature are working against me on the social thing when it comes to girls or I mean my own personal looks, cause I have had a clear of acne face for over 0 months and then right before I move to college KABOOM, it hits me after I go one week without using my prescription cause I ran out. I refilled it but then again it takes awhile to work so I was going through the transitional period then finally a couple days ago i'm truly completely clear and then the next morning I wake up with this huge cold sore on my lip. The biggest monstrous blister right on my lip. that's really going to make me look good for the girls. And right now I still have this blister. I fell like I have to wait for the blister to go away before I ask any girls out like this girl I met at this foam party this weekend. I talked to her on Tues. but we couldn't get together but now I think I may try to wait till this blister goes away before I try to meet with her again anyway. rrGeez, my back hurts right now, hold on a sec while I adjust my seat. there we go. I am really rambling on about the girls situation but I guess that's what's really on mind throughout most of my college days. I also have the work but that just seems like busy stuff to me. to tell the truth psychology is actually so far my favorite class. Not only because there are so many hot girls there but because the actual material I think is cool, like this assignment for one. I might end up writing for way more than 00 min without realizing it. Well in psyche I met this girl PROPNAME and we were walking together to jester and I just truly wonder if we ever become friends, sure we happened to meet and walked together to class one day and sit together but I somehow doubt it will happen again and that's just another example of me just becoming friends, because if I do see her again we will probably only become friends that meet maybe to study or something but I guess having a lot of good looking friends is better than no friends who are girls. back to school though I cla isn't that bad of coarse math is one of my specialties, and chem I like cause I like my professor but physics seems to be the same as high school, a boring monotone voiced professor who doesn't explain things clearly in my opinion, and I know I could get good grades if they just taught from the books cause I have the ability to learn very well but tests don't come straight from the text books do they. so that may pose as a problem, but I have a class in 00 min that I need to start heading towards so now that I've typed for 00 minutes I think ill let you go now, Later. 
__label__label0 dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream--  probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people I know really are, and especially the way that I feel about those people deep inside. I don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, I might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who I am. sometimes I admit that I am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes I admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things I didn't think I could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that I can feel for days. a lot of times I say that I am by nature an independent person, I work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but I'm not one of them. I do need my family and close friends-- I couldn't even think about living without them. but how would I be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but I have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again I guess for some "lucky" people they will never be left alone. I think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who I am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. I need to be my own person before I can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and I try to be, just not easily influenced. I try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that:  though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself. 
__label__label1 First of all, I guess would be my nervousness about school. There are several things that tie into that. I don't have a group of friends here yet that I can trust and I'm always nervous around strangers. The guy I really like asked me out, but then acts as if he's not interested. I miss home. I miss the "power" of being the big dogs at school. I know that thousands of people have felt the same way, and thousand more will feel this is the future, but it's so different when it's really me. I guess I never thought I would be the one in college. Another thing is that I'm the only person to come here from my high school in three years, so all the friends I have here now are ones I met here. One thing I do like about living here is that I have a opportunity to be my own person. I don't like being judged, and here there isn't anything on which someone could base a judgement. I also like not having to tell Mom where I am going, and stuff like that. I'M INDEPENDENT!!! I have the rest of my life to be alone. Right now I have no idea what I want to be or what my divit is. There are a lot of occupations I would like to try but most of all I want to make a difference. A BIG difference. I'd like to try truck-driving, cattle ranching, and I'd like to work at LOCNAME. Most of all I think I want to be happy. I think that's the most important thing you can do for yourself. Way back in the back of my mind are Hook' Em tryouts, and the fact that I try out this next Friday, and I haven't made up a skit for it yet. That's freshman procrastination for you!! Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed of all that ORGNAME is and stands for. It's kind of awe-inspiring to think of all the people that have gone here, it's tradition, and it's links to the future. My kinds could be here one day. That's a lot to be on one person's mind, but hey you're the one that asked. 
__label__label0 I have a lot of work I need to get done with today, and for some reason I'm kind of I the mood to do my homework. You don't know me so you don't know how uncommon this kind of mood is for me. It's like when I finally decided to clean up my room, and it was just so satisfying to get the job done. I already went home for a weekend, and I went straight to my room just to look at how clean it is. It's a very satisfying feeling to know that it's that clean because of me. I kind of miss my family, my friends, my life before I got here. And I just can't stop thinking about this. Today I was walking with my boyfriend, and this guy that I thought was really cute saw me walking with him. It's not like I was planning on dumping my boyfriend for this random guy, but I wouldn't have minded if he hadn't necessarily known that I was attached. Maybe I could've had some fun. But really I truly love my boyfriend, but things are going well, but they could always end up changing. My goal is just that I don't want to miss out on anything in college. I want to date around while I've go the chance. if some guys want to date me, that is. Tonight I'm going to this thing, I can't remember the name of it though: it's like the Christian organization for the whole campus. I'm not really sure how into it I'll be. I go to church and teach Sunday school, or at least I used to. I haven't gone to church in LOCNAME yet, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. But I don't know if this Christian thing is my kind of thing. I'm not one of those people that likes to go around trying to get people to take God into their lives. That's their choice as far as I'm concerned. I mainly decided to go to this meeting to meet some new people, and so I could do something since PROPNAME's going to be so busy today with his computer science homework. I can't complain too much though because if it wasn't for PROPNAME I wouldn't have computer up and working. I was getting kind of frantic about this assignment. I just wanted to get it done, but I just didn't have everything together. Right now I'm becoming all impressed with my typing skills. I have to look at the keyboard the entire time, but I can press the keys pretty fast. I'm quite pleased. On Saturday I'm going out to one of my family's lake houses. It's on LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they are about to sell it which makes me pretty sad. I love that place mainly cause it is so unique to have a place like that to go to. It's sad because I didn't realize how lucky I was to have that so I didn't always go when I  had the chance and it's so nice and peaceful. There's another lake house on PROPNAME PROPNAME and I really o prefer that one, but I'd rather them not sell either one. People are like protesting the sell of this property because we're selling it to developers, and that makes all of the neighbors angry. I can understand that, but I have no part in the decision making. But at least for part of this weekend I won't be stuck eating crappy Jester food. I think I'm almost to tw0enty minutes, and I kind of feel bad because I don't feel like I just wrote what came to mind. It seems planned for some reason, UT I never paused this whole time, I just kept typing and would always seem to come up with something to say, well I guess it's good-bye until my next assignment, but now I'm wondering if my assignment is as long as everyone else's. Maybe I type slower than them and maybe it hasn't quite been twenty minutes. I can't exactly remember when I actually started this, but I kind of do need to go because I have plenty of Calculus homework to do. It's not like you're even going to read this, but I'm still kind of nervous. oh well, I'm going to say I'm done now. 
__label__label1 I really wanted to get that done before I went home this weekend, but I guess I will just have to try later. I am also feeling pretty excited though right now because I just finished talking to this guy that I met on Saturday night and we are supposed to get together tomorrow night. I'm excited but I'm also nervous. I'm not really sure if I like this guy or not. The actual truth is I'm not really sure if I find him attractive. When we hooked up that night we were both under the influence of alcohol, but we weren't really drunk. My friend tells me that he's cute but I just have to take another look for myself. That's kind of mean for me to say but I don't want to be going out with an ugly guy. I feel like Gods going to punish me or something for saying this but I'm sure everyone wants to be with someone that they are attractive to. This guy is really cool though. He's a theater major or a Plan 0 major. I guess his minor is theater but anyway. He's a really funny guy. We get along really well. It's odd though because the couple of times that I have talked to him I don't even feel nervous which is odd because I usually feel nervous when I'm talking to a guy for the first time. I guess this should tell me something, that he's a pretty good match for me. We just joke around like crazy and just play off of one another's comments. It's pretty awesome. I'm kind of stuck now I really don't know what to write but now something just came into  mind. Before I was talking to this guy I talked to my friend from back home. She's getting married in October and I'm going to be her maid of honor. Hearing her talk about the wedding plans just freaks me out. I just can't believe. It makes me kind of sad though like as if I'm losing her to her future husband. It's not going to be the same anymore, I just can't go over to her house anymore and just chill out since she's not going to be living there anymore. To top everything out she's pregnant which is really the reason they are getting married but they really do love one another so they'll be happy. The day she found out she was pregnant was very freaky. I was there with her at her home when she took the home pregnancy test. She came into her room screaming oh my god PROPNAME it's already turning pink after only a few seconds. I saw the line appear which lets you know that you are indeed pregnant. I was in complete utter shock. I was almost in tears. Once we started talking about it and how cute it's going to be I would just want to cry more. It's just weird I guess having one of your best friends get married and have a baby when we're so young. I can't wait though for her to have it so I can see it and play with the baby. Even today at the mall I went into Gap Kids and looked at baby outfits. I want to buy her some really cute outfits for the baby. The baby isn't due until April sometime but it's never to early to start looking. I'm stuck again and this time I think it's for good. Come on you can think of something. OK this is to weird I'm writing to myself on the computer telling myself to think of something. I'm almost done I have one more minute. I'm actually freaked that I actually got done with this before Sept 00 when it's due. I always wait for the last minute but I'm starting the year off good and doing thing ahead of time. I feel relief now that I'm done. Yeahh. 
__label__label0 I am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. I don't know if I made the right decisin in coming here, I guess that's because people keep on asking me where I an from and when I say LOCNAME they all ask me why I transfered and why I came here, as if LOCNAME is so amazing and this place sucks. I guess LOCNAME is pretty amazing in some ways. But it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. Added to that I don't like knowing everyone, well I like knowing people but I don't like it when you have no aninimity. I also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, I guess that goes without saying. I feel like I have to step up my game and almost go out "hunting" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. It's not terrible romantic, but I'm getting pretty desperate. There are some hot hot girls here. I don't know what's my problem, It's probably because I live in LOCNAME which is on the other end of the earth. That's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. Although it is a lot easier when your living with them. It's not so bad I've meet some women here, but the one that I am more serious with, I don't find myself attracted to at all. She's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but I really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. It's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. But I really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from LOCNAME. No I really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. I need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem. But I really want to go out with PROPNAME, she is a goddess on earth, she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous. I can't belive it, and I act like such a dork around her but she doesn't seem to mind, and that's what I loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot, I must do eveything in my power to win her I must put the wheels in motion before she gets snatched up, because I know that if I don't act soon and I mean like in the next five minutes, some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what I see and I cannnot let that happen not this time, I've let that happen too many times in the past I've let every girl that I've ever had feelings for get away. And PROPNAME may be the one, she's in the fricking Pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that I am, but if I were with her I would not let that happen. I would do everything for her, I would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her. I have my mission, I must develop my plan, and somewhere in between I must get some studying done. Straight A's and PROPNAME that will be the story of my life for this year. 
__label__label0 What am I feeling right now, hmmmmmmm. my consciousnesss. Right now it's the afternoon and I'm feeling pretty hungry. My stomach feels pretty empty and I think I can fill it up w\ a lot of food. My feelings and thoughts are pretty mixed up right now. There is so much going on. My mind is on so many things. there is so much to do. first I'm thinking about a girl that I was with and I left because of school. then I have to get my books for class. I still haven't fit in and I don't feel relaxed yet because of the things I have to do. I'm worried about if my financial aid is ever going to come through so I can pay for the books. Those books cost a lot of money. But this overpowering hunger of mine is really taking up a lot of my thoughts. somehow, though I am able to pull those really tiny thoughts which are really important. Man, I don't know what else. It's pretty crazy that I am here in LOCNAME away from H-town, but next weekend I'll be able to go back home the hunger . man I wish I had eaten a lot earlier, all I had was some lasagna leftover. I can't believe I'm writing or typing for this long and straight because my forearm is starting to hurt. oh well, got to keep writing I hope this psychology class isn't so hard, that pretest was pretty damn long w\ thirty -two pages. the reason why there are no spelling mistakes is because I don't like to have errors, sorry. I wonder what the point of this is? their not going to check it. what are they going to do to this hmmmm. interesting I wonder what I'm going to write to her I miss everybody. my forearm really hurts I want to stop but there's only a few minutes left. right after this I'm going to the pulse and getting my money to get my books. I think UT is awesome, there is so many possibilities. these computers in the business school are pretty awesome too. hurry up time . I like this asssignment though, I like it a lot. I still don't get the freakin' assignments to the freakin' calculus class. I'm glad I was able to  drop English is the twenty minutes almost up yet?!!!! Holy crap. the veins on my forearms are poppin' out. Beautiful babies everywhere pennebaker cool. Hi there. this is me killing time . I have a lot more thoughts but I'm hungry and myforearm hurts. I'm typing w\one finger now. its almost up. this thing makes me sleepy. one minute left. yessss. wwhhhhooooeeee!!let'sgo it;'s over 
__label__label1 Tired, stressed, already sick of school and it has only been the first week. What can I say other than I have to do great this semester. I never knew that school would be this stressful. There are so many things going on in my life right now that I really do not have time for. I feel like my brain is on overload and don't know when I am going to get all of this stuff done. Hungry, what can I say, I am always craving something. I am sitting in my dorm room all alone because my friends have all gone out to this Sig Ep party and I opted to stay home and catch up on things that I need to get done. I hate typing too. Although typing is a lot easier to do because it is a lot faster. I just hate it when I mess up and hit the wrong key. It really irritates me when my phone rings late at night and it is one of my friends from home and you can't understand a word they are saying because they have been out partying all night long. Have you ever noticed that when people have had a little too much to drink that they get real emotional?  When I returned home last night from being out, one of my friends from home was hysterically crying over something a guy said to her at a party. He commented on what she was wearing and obviously she took it the wrong way and got mad. Of course I knew it was no big deal, but she really thought it was. This morning, of course, she ran into my room wondering what had happened last night and why she got upset. It was such a big deal last night, but this morning she was so embarrassed. I have done the same thing that she did. Gosh, I miss my parents and I never really thought that I would. My senior year I was so tired of the high school scene. I think I was the only one of my friends that hated my senior year. Well, I can't say that I absolutely hated it, but I was ready to go on to bigger and better things. My boyfriend lived here, so maybe that's why I wanted to leave home so badly. My phone bill is going to be so high this semester. I talk to all of my friends so much on the phone. I also talk to my parents a lot too. I especially talk to my mom. I was always so close to my mom and it is hard to be away from her. I could always drive home one weekend. It is not very far away. I just found out today that we are going to have to go to ten hours of study hall every week. It sounds bad, but I really think this is good for me especially coming into my freshman year and trying to get adjusted to this new life that I am leading now. I was always independent, but now I feel that I am on my own for good. I really like only depending on myself for things. 
__label__label1 How am I going to do? Who am I? How do I compare to everyone else around me? So many questions yet no answers. I'm hopig to have fun and enjoy my experiences. Is my family thinking of me? I hope all is well with them. Expressing my feelings and thoughts on paper is hard to do. Am I doing this right? I don't no what I'm doing really. In school that is. Don't know if I'm able to be successful. Wait,m I know I can be successful. just have to dig down deep inside and find meyself. So lost without God and best freind. Dpn't know what the futre holds or what will happen. Kinda scared and hesitant. I want to love my job and my family. I want so many things for my life and I want to fullfill my goals. I want to be a rockstar. To see crowds of people go crazy at the sight of me. Who doesn't though? Maybe its just a dream. I feel destined to have a career in music. My only escape frpm life itself is music mostly guitar. I want to makee a differece in my society. To figure out where humans came from and to answers questions about life. But who doesn't want to do that? I want to stand out. I want to be a hero in my society and a mentor amongst my peers. I want poeple to remember me for the rest of time. For the good things that I've done. For differences that I've made in peoples lives. I want to lead my friends to PROPNAME and show them how wonderfull it is to be a christian. my life is wonderful and I sometimes take for granted all that I have. Sometimes I realize much I regret some of the things I have done. Time can change me, but I can't change time. Well, I think its been 00 mins. Later. i'm out 
__label__label0 My goodness, I have so much stuff to do. Where should I start?  I have to call about volunteering and for sure email PROPNAME to see if they have a Physical Therapy program at her hospital. How will I get this stuff done. I am torn as to whether or not to join a Fraternity. I think I will, I just hope I have time to get my studies done. As well as time to myself. I really need to get my bike back from PROPNAME's apartment. I'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. Sometime tomorrow I have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. I need 0 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. I am so glad I changed my class schedule. It will be so much better this way. I am so stressed out about physics. I so hope I at least make a "B" in there. Pray, oh pray. I should make it to the ORGNAME Thursday evening and check that out. I am sure there are some good looking ladies there. I can't believe the Horns lost. What the heck?  To N. c. State. They better come back and win this week against ORGNAME. Actually we need PROPNAME back. Another thing is I need to wash my car. It's pitiful!  Definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. Or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. I seriously hope things go well with the Fraternity. I mean that is a lot of $$$. Campus looks nice tonite. I love the tower. I think I like college football way better than pro. It has so much more of an aura to it. The pros don't have any spirit. The college game is where it's at. I wonder where my roomate is. That punk never tells me when he's leaving. I still have to do the pretest. I tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. I need to make sure and read for History and Government. I hope this Thursday schedule is going to work. I am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like I thought it was going to be. Actually pretty good. Oh man, I just got an Instant Message. Oh well, I really need to finish this assignment. I kind of like this. Let's me get my feelings out. I need to find a Church for sure. I haven't been reading my Bible like I should since I got to Austin. I really need to work on that. I wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. This move from a ORGNAME college is a bit extreme. Nothing like high school to college, but I went from a college with  0,000, to a college of 00,000. I probably have met 000 people so far. I am so terrible with names. I really need to work on that. My suite mates are being loud. Makes me not want to study. Or at least go elsewhere. I should probably check out the UGL or PCL anyway. I bet I could do a better job there in the first place. So what am I going to do this weekend?  It being Labor Day, I kind of have a choice. I might go to LOCNAME to visit my Sister or might stay and go to the lake with  PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I really miss my folks. Way more than I expected. I hope I get over it soon. I need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. I wonder what my new Physics prof is going to be like?  Good or Bad?  Nice or Unpleasant?  What?  I need to start praying more. Maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. Whatever happens, I need to call PROPNAME tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. This class schedule is going to be so much easier!  I love it!  No Friday school!  Three day weekends for a whole semester. I hope my ORGNAME classes aren't too strenuous all together. This is my first time to really balance 0 classes like that. 
__label__label1 I notice that my mind always wonders off to the things in my life that I wish were better. I tend to think about the differences between what I should be doing in my life right now, and what I am doing. I also find that one person in particular continues to pop into my head, a girl no less, one that I knew about a year ago, only for a brief period of time, but I miss her every day. I also have thoughts of longing to be back home, with my mom and my dogs. I miss high school. I built up a large list of friends over a span of twelve years, and now all of a sudden I'm starting from scratch again. Like kindergarten in a way. I also feel the pressure of my mouting homework that continues to pile up, atop of which sits two gigantic architecture projects, both of which are do in a shorter amount of time then I am capable of finishing them in. Life is getting harder. Being a kid was so easy. I want to be a rock star. the path was set, my band was doing great, writing songs, about to cut our first albm, when college ripped us apart. Nothing makes sense anymore. Take me home. 
__label__label1 I'm really worried about shannon I wonder if shes going to be ok it scares me a lot. I'm never known anyone my age to have something serious like that. I wonder if it was cause by anything like a cell phone or living by a tower or whatever. it makes me wonder if that could happen to me. I'm not sure why people smoke. its such a disgusting habit, but people seem to do it because it looks cool and because other people are doing it. I could understand why people smoked in high school it made you bad or something but not it just hurts your health and makes you ugly. I need to go brush my teeth. I wonder what reid is doing. he is so hot, I really would like to get with him, and I'm starting to lose intrest in chris. I feel trapped by him. I love being able to call on him whenever I want to do something. he's sort of my conveinent boyfriend. I guess that's not fair to him, but I'd almost rather it just be this way. I have a voice mail. who could that be from. I wonder when they will fix my phone. I love talking on the phone. I miss my mom. I don't miss my dad. I wonder how to tell him not to come home for parents weekend. I hate him. he'll maake me fell miserable either way. they are coming to fix my phone. thank god. I wonder if my date tonight will be cute. I like that outfit I wore last night. I really love suzanne and kristin and kleigh. suzanne is so awesome, but I wish we were all in the same sorority. actually no I don't. this way we have 0 close friends from different sororities and I have becoem good friends with PROPNAME PROPNAME and tara. tara's awesome. I love all my sisters. I wonder what will happen when christy comes in town. I hope her and brian break up so I can set him up with someone. he's a good guy she doesn't deserve him. I think they're relationship is completely sexual. I wonder if I'll ever get married. I wonder if my dad will ruin that day for me too. I wonder if my mom will get married. I am embarassed of my parents sometmes. that makes me feel like such a bad person, but I can't help it. I love my mom. I wonder if anything bad will happen to brian because of those shirts he stole. I think that is so wrong. mike plays guitar. I wish I palyed guitar. acoustic not electric. I'd like to be able to play brown eyed girl. I wonder if I could be on staff for asp. I wonder if I could be a camp texas counselor. that counsleor that made me "hiney write" was awesome. he was a cool guy. doug is awful. I hope I never get played. I wonder if I'm playing chris. I would feel better if he would date someone else. god I wonder where reid is right now. he has no friday classes. my suitemates phone is ringing. are they up. do tehy have class. will she ever stop drinking?  I hope she learns to slow down. she's an alcoholic. that guy was not even cute. I should talk to her. kathryn is cool. I want kathryn to amke a painting for me. I like fruit loops. yum. are we out of milK?  damn I have to buy cheese. I want a quesdilla. why did that boy stop by at0?  what an idiot. I'm probably more likely to help him. I like the body builder next door. he likes me too. I wonder if PROPNAME PROPNAME and kyle talked about me. she seemed to be very curious about chris being my boyfriend or not. I feel like a bitch when I think this, but I wish kyle would shave his go-t. who arranged the keyboard?  why are they in this order. I think its easier to have it this way then in alphabetical order. you use the letters asdf allot. and jkl. and ert. I wonder if sesame street is on. I liked bert and ernie. there was an episode of my so called life where rayanne sang how to get to sesame street. it was awesome. I hate that girl from the tri-delt house. I don't' know why they don't like me. I wonder what to wear tonight. damn it I need to study. has it been 00 minuts. how come I don't have any hot professors?  I like ut. I don't want to drink anymore. am I going to get fat?  kleigh is cute. I wish I had her figure. some people are lucky. I love my bed. its so soft. its lunchtime I'm not hungry. I wish I were skinny like andrea. I wonder if wolfe likes me. I think I scared him last night with my story about the elevator. why do the elevatros ehre take so long. I can't believe what happened to me and chris in the elevator. that was so emabarssing, and yet I can smile/laugh at it. chris is cool. i have a lecutre to go to today. I have to read. I have to work out. I have to call whats his anem and tell him I can't go. I don't think kleigh will go. what to do. 
__label__label1 I don't know where to start. My mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. UT is great but I am not sure where I fit into things right now. It is really just one big cycle for the time being. When I was driving here from LOCNAME, my dad told me that I would not hang out with any of the people I already knew because you will "drift apart. "  But I like my friends. I have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. I also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. The three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. For me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. Constantly. I want to fit in somewhere, but I am not sure I want to pay for it. It really is strange. All this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. Speaking of study, I have nothing to do but read. No busy work. Just reading. That kind of reading will fry your brain. This has been a weird week. Everything has changed. School, friends, family (or lack of). It is kind of cool, though. I am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. It is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. I simply want it to be easy. I guess that is what college is for. It teaches you to grow up. Now I have laundry to do. Just another fun thing to do. It really sounds negative, but my life is good, I guess. Just finished that 00 page questionnaire. While most of it was simple, it really does make you think. Especially when it asks, "Are you certain about your answers?"  Who knows?  Do you like yourself? Of course. Are you sure?  Yep. I guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. That never crosses my mind. It is too much fun to live. Challenging experiences though. Sure wish UT would have won yesterday. It was great yesterday. Went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. That just kind of ruins the whole effect. Back to the frat thing. We were supposed to go to party for the ORGNAME ORGNAME's after the game. I really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. Most of the guys are cool. But I think I am going to wait. They all say it is best to join 0st semester, but that is what "they" say. I believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. I guess. I think I just need to meet more girls. That would make life much more enjoyable. That has got to be the answer. I have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. But at that point, I never knew the difference. Now it is hard. I think it is because of insecurity. I am really not afraid to admit it. I am insecure in meeting girls, but I will have to grow out of it. For now, I just wish I didnt have to read so much. It isn't that bad, just boring. You cannot retain 00 pages of economics in one day. It is just not possible. But I guess I will try my best. 
__label__label1 I can't make up my mind if I want to go to a meeting with PROPNAME or not. He asked me to go, but I kind of don't want to go. I have a math quiz in the morning and I need to go over the problems. Anyway. i haven't heard from PROPNAME in a while. I hate it when guys tell me that they are goingto call and they don't. PROPNAME was acting strange towards me at the ORGNAME meeting yesterday. O well, I hope he dosen't want a relationship with me. I cannot handle one right now. I don't understand why I always I have to speak to people before they speak to me. I know they see me coming. I'm not going to worry about that though. I wonder if I should participate in the Miss Black and Gold Pageant. I really don't see myself as the type of lady that enters those kinds of things. First of all, I don't have a talent. Second of all, I'm not good at answering questions right off the top of my head. I have four years until I can do it, so I might just wait. If Cookie does it, then I will. I'm kind of excited about going home on the 00th. It's the Homecoming Ceremonies that night. I'll get to see my recent ex-boyfriend. I can't believe that he still tells people that we are still going together. He has a lot of nerve. Anyway. it hasn't even been ten minutes and I'm already tired of typing. Psychology is confusing to me. So is Philosophy and Biology. I don't know what to believe in now. I was brought up as a Christian, but now I realize that science proves some things in the bible to be wrong. I still don't know what came first, the dinosaurs or man. Anyway, I'm not going to worry about that either. There are so many guys here that are attractive, but the bad part about it is that they know they are attractive. Guys around here seem to stereotype the freshman girls as "easy, silly and stuck-up". I have to admit, a lot of my classmates are stuck-up, but I don't think they are silly. Once again, I don't understand why I always have to be the one to speak to everyone first. It's mostly the girls who have to be spoken to. Soem of the guys are like that too. I like the college life so far. My parents used to never let me do anything. They were so strict on me. Now, I go out whenever I want to, but I'm not going cray with it. They thought that I would go wild when I got to college, but I haven't. I'm mature enough for college. My brother on the other hand wasn't. He went to college for a day and quit. He was so worried about getting money, that he quit scholl to get a job. He needs that job too because his ex-girlfriend is going to hit him up on child support. My paremts tried to warn him, but he was hard-headed. 
__label__label1 Austin is very different from my home town. I live in a small town about 00 miles south of LOCNAME called LOCNAME. It has only 0000 people in the whole town. Everywhere you go you run into someone you know. Austin is so big and when I meet people I wonder if I will ever see them again, but so far I have seen a lot of people I have met. I live in PROPNAME and I have met a lot of girls in my dorm that are really nice. I like the LOCNAME campus too. It is not to spread out although I do have to walk a lot to get to my classes. That is ok because I can use the exercise. This psychology class and my chemistry class have over 000 people in it. That was very overwhelming for me but I have adjusted somewhat. Today I was walking on the drag and saw so many people out and about for the game. It is the first game of the season and I'm very excited. There are so many people that used to go to school here or are just big Longhorn Fans. They are all dressed in orange and many have their kids with them and even the kids are dressed in orange and white. It is really neat to see so many supporters and fans of the school and the football team. I am really excited about the game. I hope we beat LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. It seems so weird that I can consider myself as "we" or part of the UT traditon, atmospere, and college!  I hear we have the number one recruiting team in the nation. That is cool because these are people the same age as me. I met one of the new recruits the other night. He was huge and I'm sure he plays on defense. He sure didn't look like a freshman!!  As you can tell I like football. I think a lot of that has to do with the time of year. Probably also because my dad was a high school football coach and I've grown up with it all my life. Also I was a cheerleader in high school and I miss cheering a little, so I always look forward to a football game. That is probaly why I am so excited about the game today. It is amazing to me that so many other people feel the same way about football. I also am excited about the game because it will be fun to learn the UT traditons and meet new people. Well my 00 minutes is up. I hope I wrote enough but I just don't type very fast so it takes me awhile to type out what is on my mind. 
__label__label0 WEll right now I'm doubting I can write for the next 00 minutes straight. I don't think I have that much material, that's worth putting down anyway. Id rather be doing something else for the next 00 minutes. I'm looking forward to going out tonight. There is a party and it should be a lot of fun. I'm going to get drunk and that will be fun. Class this week was interesting, however I worry that I am falling behind in a couple of my classes. There's so much reading and such little time. I'm pledging Delt and that keeps me really busy. That's who the party is with tonight, my pledge class. They are pretty cool guys. These guys keep walking in here and interupting my writing. That is annoying. I had this girlfriend named PROPNAME. We broke up before we came to school. I think about her a lot now. I guess I miss her. I hope she is doing well. i am still thinking about her. I need to go help a couple of my friends sneak liquor up into Towers. My time is just about up anyway. This really wasn't that bad of an assignment. I had fun. See you in class. 
__label__label1 I don't believe it I hate the way things are with the club and stuff I just don't feel like I belong I mean with monica it's okay but with PROPNAME and PROPNAME I just hate the way they take over everything why didn't they even let us work on the poster it was just them two why did I even go up there in the first place I mean annette never called back it was just like whatever oh well I really do hate it now. how can I be the network chair what do I know about building webpages why did she just ask me if I had gotten on her computer like what? she probably thouhght I got on it because the screensaver was on I did send her that life expectancy test I am going to live until I'm 00 according to it I sent PROPNAME the camera test I can't believe janie left me how could she get marriedd tubby toast I wonder who that is lit's Munchechee man I realllt don't' feel like talking to aziza or anyone she just came back with her  books all happy I jjust hate the way sthings got so messed up last year it was so different I'm so happy my classses from summer school were transferred yippe I won't get dropped tomorrow mr kapluvousky's so nice why did karla just like leave like that she doesn't make sense along with another one who is sitting right next to me all typing away there goes tubby toast again who knows who that was I need to call melanie I really don't know if I should talk to her I mena I don't even know her even though our parents do work together still I don't know she sounds like she 's really loud  I need to go brush my teeth that monkey thing was pretty funny she's talking to me something about wednesday man tomorrow is wednesday I really don't want to go to the lab 0-0 that's like an eternity and then when am I going to eat dinner I'm going to be starve man I'm hungry right now I feel like having some milk maybe late nite is open karla said they had grilled cheese sandwich howcome PROPNAME didn't call today who knows but tomorrwo she'll come banging on my window sixteen dollars for office 0000 no way that doesn't sound right maybe some copies karla is talking wan'ts to borrow abby's compute has a resume due tomorrow the light is too bright karlas gone I feel bad that I didn't get to talk to my parents when they called I really hope they get the house although I don't want them to stress they have enough problems but it's for the besst although junior is going to freak and plus I am scared for us not really the best house but it's a start gosh how are they going to do it by the end of this month it's going to happen and then the wedding is on the 00th but I have tests that following monday I can't miss the wedding the wedding of my cousin whom I don't know I don't know anyone there only rosa and ma's hermana I don't want them to ask me any weird questions like always do you have a boyfriend I hate that question and that's all they want to know no not about my studies just about my love life I don't get them I hate the way my mother loves to tell them that no judy doesn't have time for boyfriends it will certainly be something with allthe family there what am I going to wear howcome they didn't say anything the invitation should be home now I really want to see it it's like the first time I ever experience a real inivitation from my family. 
__label__label1 Upon coming to UT I thought about it in much detail. Being used to air conditioned High School, I told my roommate that I think that the entire university should be one building. This building would have to be about 000 stories high, or remain the same size, just in a huge bubble. Now that class has started, I see that the temp. problem is not that big of a deal, so I say screw it. I also thought class would be easier. Since there aren't any daily grades, quizes, or numerous tests, I find it difficult to be happy with my current state of mind concerning my academics. I constantly feel that I need to study. I find this extremely difficult lately now that the fraternity has us running around with little time for relaxation. Thank goodness they allow us study time. I don't know much about college life yet because I haven't been through at least one semester yet, but I don't think engineering will be as easy as I had hoped. The math concerning the major is so overwhelming that I find myself with extremely high levels of anxiety while attending the class. The TA teaches on tues. /thurs. and then I have a supplemental instruction class too. If it wasn't for the GE (supplemental) class I don't think I would be able to cut it. I came out of high school thinking that math was just natural, but I realize that the quality of teachers makes all the difference in the world. I realize how jaded the topics I discuss are and also want to mention that I am extremely frustrated with the entry level professors (I'm really just dirrecting my anger towards the math department). The guy barely speeks english and he basically stands at the front of the class and puts on a display of how good he is at math. "OOH, look at me I'm Romanian and I know lots of math; you can never know as much math as me. To make sure you never know as much math as me I'm going to run though this matterial so quickly that none of you can process it and assign you so much homework that with my shortcummings as a teacher, you with surely sit for hours trying to figure out this stuff on your own. "  I am obviously dramatizing the situation, but this is the only way I can describe my frustration; however there is some truth to my insanity. 
__label__label1 At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know "everything" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here in my dorm room wondering and thinking about everything I have to get done by tomorrow. It's not a lot but just little things. I have to buy a speech book, read the first two chapters out LOCNAME it, write a speech and type an outline for it that's due for tomorrow. We don't start giving the speeches until Friday though so I'm not to worried about it. I also need to go over my chemistry. I'm going out to eat at the Hula Hut for dinner tonight with my pledge class. That should be fun. I can't wait to see my boyfriend. He is going to school at the LOCNAME of LOCNAME and it's so hard not being able to see him whenever I want. Oh well. His birthday is Sept. 00 so I'm going to go home to see him. I can't wait for this weekend becasue there is so much to do. We have a match with the SAE's on Fridayl, the game is Saturday afternoon, and then some of my friensds and I are going to go float down the river. I guess I should throw in some study time now and then. i'm really hungry but she is not coming to get me until six o'clock for dinner. I really need to do some laundry too. I'm running out of clean t-shirts. I can do that later though. I'm off to study some more and do what ever. 
__label__label0 I'm now worrying about what to write which is really irrelavant because to the instructions. I am at a loss. When the mind watches itself most of it stands still. But when it stops being vigilant it wanders anywhere and everywhere past, and future. Again I can think of nothing when watching the mind think of something which is very ironic. And again it stops and doesn't go anywhere when I try to see where it is. I hope I don't bomb this paper which I'm not sure how its to be graded. I bet my grammer really sucks, if I can use that word "suck"  but I shouldn't worry about my grammar because it doesn't matter according to the instructions yet because of insecurities I still worry about my presentation, any presentation. Now I am talking to my friend and being distracted, but since I reallize it I'm no longer distracted. What else is going through this undeveloped mind of mine, wow, that rhymes, mind and mine, ok, I probably sound really stupid now but am just following instructions. The phone rings, and I think that it may be my mother checking up on me which she already did, but I'm sure would not hesitate to do it again. Room is now quiet with everybody gone, no distractions except for the unknown mind with all of its mysteries. Funny its always with us yet we know next to nothing about it which maybe this class will attempt to shed some light on but I doubt it will do very much good for anyone to decrease thier pains and increase their happiness. Everything in psych. is great but helps no one if it serves no purpose such as increasing the quality of ones life. Philosophy I believe tries to a bit more to do just that but is so abstract and too much of a subject to be studied than to be experienced and learned which doesn't help anyone anyways except to tickle and play with the intellect. Unless a certain form is adapted to the way of living and adopted as the way of thinking will it help those who really seek help. Now I'm a little afraid all that I just wrote is irrelevant to the assignment and will recieve a bad score. Perhaps another manifestation of insecurity. This world today is full of insecurities, fear, though we have everything anyone could want in the LOCNAME, but yet we lack that which cannot be externaly obtained. How ironic that most of us strive in life but never know what we are striving for, what PROPNAME PROPNAME calls personal management but lack of personal leadership, direction. Because we seem to have everything we want but are actually lacking we don't know where to direct our constant thirst for happiness and constant aversion of suffering. But the cause of our pains is ignorance, the lack of wisdom, wisdom - understanding but mostly realizing how things really are. Perhaps to this is to philisophical for the assignment. but as thoughts come into my head I write just like the instruction say. Although I can think of no reason for this assignment excpet to observe the mind, but I can not see anything to learn. yeah, maybe the next assignments are also like this, but probably not, wishful thinking. Almost done, just two more minutes and I maybe will continue the other assignments. Our study hall in our dorm really sucks. Its very creepy looking with all sorts of pipes and wires running through the wall. Uh, oh, girl thoughts, probably not appropriate, I don't even know if I spelled that word correctly. My mama told me that mastery over the mind is the highest form of victory anyone can have. It is said that a man may conquer a thousand people and a thousand lands, but it is far better to conquer himself just once. 
__label__label1 Alright, this is going to be pretty random, so whomever may be reading this should be pretty amused. Hmmm. . i had my audition for the "Madrigal Dinner" tonight. I think it went pretty well. I sang a song that I wrote. He seemed pretty impressed. I find out Monday morning if I made it or not. I think until then I am going to have a nervous tick thing happening. I broke up with my boyfriend this weekend. He is really stupid, "dumber than a box of hair" as I like to say. That sounds pretty mean, but he really is. He isn't going anywhere. He is a 0th year high school student. If you carry on a conversation with him that involves a word with more than 0 letters, he is lost. Unless it is about auto mechanics. Then he will talk your ear off. Or if it is about drugs, he can talk 000000 miles an hour on that subject. We were just too different. I'm not into drugs and stuff and I am 00 and already in college. He is a pot head (along with other things) and he's 00 and still in high school. He is going nowhere. He wrote me a really shitty letter today. It made me feel like crap. It was along the lines of "I am nothing. You are too good for me. I should have known that the second I got something good I would lose it. "  How am I supposed to respond to somthing like that?????  My friends said it was his feeble attempt to win me back. A very feeble attempt. I am not conned into taking someone back because they make me feel guilty for ruining their life. I feel really bad though, because his parents absolutely adored me. I was everything they wanted him to be. I am fairly intelligent, Christian, drug-free, etc. I feel kinda like I let them down. But I wasn't getting to him. I couldn't change him. It's not my fault right??  What could I do?  I can lead him to the right path, but I can't force him to change. I showed him what PROPNAME did for my life, did in my life, what influence God had over me. But he was so stuck on his paegan ways. He told me he was going to quit drugs for me, but he never did. I can't be with someone for the sole reason of trying to change them. I don't know. I miss my ex-boyfriend. Not the same guy. A different one. We went out for 0 years, then he slept with my best friend. On that ridiculously long survey that we had to do for this class, that "worst depression" stuff was caused by him. 0 years!!!  And then he just threw it all away. Gosh, I miss him terribly. Sometimes I still cry at night thinking about him. I have yet to find a love so strong like I had with him. Have you ever felt that?  That feeling like you know, I don't know exactly what you know. You just know something. That feeling deep inside. That feeling noone else can give you. I had that with him. We were even engaged. Engaged!!  He made me feel like I was something worth having. Well, until he screwed my EX best friend. Stupid whore!  I'm not bitter. Hehehe, anyway. I don't know. Sometimes he is all I can think of. I'll catch myself comparing other guys to him. Every other guy I have dated has been compared to him. Should I put a name to "him"?  His name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I always have this emptiness inside me. I didn't feel empty with him. It was like he made me complete. And when he left, he took a big part with him. I know that sounds trite, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. Just pure emptiness. I got so depressed after the "incident"  that I didn't have the will to do anything. Nothing. I just laid there in bed. I would be in a trance through school just to come home and lay there. didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, didn't sleep. I never slept, but I was never awake either. It was like I was one of those vegetable people who was purely living because of the machines they are hooked up to. There was this invisible machine keeping me alive, and that was it. I was just existing. That's the word I was looking for. Existing. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried to make it less. Have the scars to prove it. Nothing I'm proud of. I had just reached the lowest I have ever felt. I'm sure it will happen again. I'm only 00. I'm sure I will find another guy that will fill the void PROPNAME left, but then he will leave me too. So what's the use anyway?  Dating is just a vicious circle. Someone is bound to get hurt. If not you, then the other person. Unless of course you find that one person that doesn't have the urge to bang one of your friends. But shit, that even happens in marriages. You think you found that one person that won't screw you over, and what happens? They screw some younger, prettier girl. Gosh, I'm really bitter. When did I get this bitter??  Is it bitterness or cynicism?  I can never tell the difference. Maybe I'm a little (or a lot) of both. <Deep sigh>  One minute left. Okay, now I'm depressed. I was in a good mood after my audition. Then I get to thinking. Damn thinking. It never does me any good. I always seem to think about things that depress me. I think it is because all of my good memories are linked to painful ones. So I try to think of good ones, but it just takes a turn for the worse. Adios! 
__label__label1 I hate the miami dolphins and jimmy johnson, always smacking his lips. the broncos suck with out elway and not the dolphins will win. god I hate the dolphins. I miss erin so much, I hope I can stay faithful to her. everyone makes me feel stupid for staying with her when she is still in high school, but she is only 0 hours away. I can hardly wait till she comes down this weekend. I could not be more stressed, tests and other crap are bogging me down. it is so hard to make friends here that I feel comfortable around and that is only making me more nervous and stressed. I hate my rtf class, it is stupid and pointless. the reading is so painful I can barely stand to do it. dammit the dolphins scored again! I hate the dolphins! thank god almighty the cowboys won,I would have had a heart attack if they had lost, I miss my friends so much. I can hardly wait to see them in a month. there are so many damn hippies around here, sometimes they are entertaining but they are mostly just annoying. DAMN I HATE THE DOLPHINS. my phone bill is going to be huge from talking to erin, my parents are going to kill me. I feel pressured to entertain her friends this weekend and that I also stressing me out. my room needs to be cleanded badly, this place is disgusting. why can't erin just be here now, if she went here my life would be next to perfect. 
__label__label1 I am so excited about being down at LOCNAME but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at LOCNAME. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to ORGNAME- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at ORGNAME ORGNAME is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and then I am going to study some Spanish and try to start reading Psychology. I am really mad that I am going to miss the first exam but thankfully I will be able to make it up. I am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. I almost wish I was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when I give it up. I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten to do and see since I have been Miss Teen of LOCNAME and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. I would like to run for President of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. I would love to be President of Pi Phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. I haven't gotten involved in anything at ORGNAME yet and I am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. My neck hurts today and I think it is from carrying my backpack all around. I had to take a bunch of my books back to the Co-op the other day so I got to lug the around. NOT FUN! LOCNAME is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. My sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to ORGNAME, but I love it at LOCNAME. I just really feel at home in LOCNAME and I enjoy the diversity of all the people. It really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. Coming from LOCNAME, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. Well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. I guess I will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading. 
__label__label1 Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 0. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME too. Which makes things even more confusing. One, if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing?(It's only an hour and 00 minutes away, but still that's different than living in the same town 0 minutes away) Also what goes on in my head is would I really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would I really want to put up with whole long distance thing. I can't stop thinking about him and I think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too. He is actually 0 years older than me, so I know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college. I don't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways I am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head. I just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that I do, but who knows I guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and I are going to work out, so I should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much. I guess I can only prepare myself the best I can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy I guess is ment to be. 
__label__label1 I guess right now I would be feeling on edge, or wary. It is on rare occassion that I have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. I worry about everything, though. I worry about this class. What will the tests be like? Am I studying enough? How many times should I review the material? I know that it is better to "overlearn" something, but in doing so, I think I will go crazy. I try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top  of the previously assigned work. I cannot convert into a complete "bookworm" because I would not be at ease with myself. I need time to relax and just chill with my friends. It is almost a set system that I have with myself that I read as much as I can, and then I go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. It's kind of ironic that the thing I reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, I have a killer soar throat. from what, I have no idea. It's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. I'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because I hate being sick. I love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. Yes, I am aware of DAYquill, but it has such a bad taste. Gross. it does work, though. hopefully what I have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever I had the other day. I was burning up. The only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. I took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the ORGNAME called to invite me out to eat. I really wanted to go, but I couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that I couldn't go because I want to be able to be as involved as I can in any organization that I join. I felt as though I had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. Thursday, I will hosting for apple computer at the ORGNAME company night. I think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but I need to do some "boning" up on the apple company before I speak with any of the recruiters. of course, I will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when I have four classes, and which is also the day that I promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night I was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. From everything I have mentioned, I have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that I am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if I really could have done something or not, or even where I stand in life. weeks before I came to ut, it seemed like I had a firm grip on life. I had a group of friends that I partied with all the time, and while I knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while I still have my ties, I now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, "What am I doing with  myself?" I know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because I am  "building" myself, but I don't think I can completely be myself yet, because I don't know "completely" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, "Be yourself. " I'd say that half of the people at this school don't know who that is. in any case, I need to go smoke. 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking that college is pretty tough. I am constantly questioning my ability to do well in college. I want to make my parents proud yet I also want have a good time. I like to party a lot a little too much probaly. I just want to know how much partying is too much. I like to do what makes me feel good and school work does not make me feel good. In fact it stresses me out severely. I wish the world was a little simplier. I wonder if the way our soceighty is good or not. Successful human beings work their asses off to achieve a good living. Is that the way god wanted it or should we live a relaxed life with lots of fun. For me that would be partying spending time on the lake and going hunting and fishing. Is good for humans to work hard and stress there entire life. Maybe stress is the cause of fatal disease like cancer. It seems the more we evolve the more we work and stress things maybe this is leading us into different illnesses. I don't know I don't think one man does know. We could be completly on the wrong track or we could be evolving better than what anybody thought we could. I want finish school and be a successful human being but I would like to know if this is the right thing to be doing. All the human race would say definatly yes but what if we should be living amore relaxed less stressful and more fun life. Doing what makes each person feels good could be the answer. Life just seems funny because people are not robots they could do whatever they want but we choose to go to college and try to be successful. Maybe people just go through all the trouble to make money someday but if you think about it money is created by humans and if every wanted it they could just give it to everyone. All of this might not seem logical but I am human and these are some of the thoughts that go through my head. I going to listen to myself to and not be something I'm not. I want to succeed and make everyone proud but also I am going to have a lot of fun!! 
__label__label1 I think the emmys are kinda boring tonight and I don't really feel like doing this assignment but I have to because I know I won't feel like doing it tomorrow because I have a busy day - I need to go wash my towels because I don't have any clean ones for tomorrow I wish the stupid laundry room was closer because I hate walking all the way down that other hall but oh well - my stomach keeps hurting because I drank too much last night I wish I hadn't done that because I have felt nauseous all day and its not fun - I don't like martin short I think he's annoying and his speech he is giving right now is not evn funny maybe I should study after I'm done with this instead of being lazy and sitting here watching tv all night - I hope that I am not behind in any of my reading because that would suck if I don't do well on my tests - I wonder where my roomate is and when she is coming back I haven't seen her all weekend but I'm sure she is just at her boyfriend's I just need to remember to tell her chris called twice today I wonder who chris is because I have never met him but he calls her a lot - our room looks messy right now I need to clean it but I don't feel like it the bathroom is starting to get pretty gross too but no one ever does anything about it because it sucks to clean up after other people especially in the bathroom maybe my mom will clean it for us when she comes to visit because she doesn't mind doing that kind of stuff for me - if she doesn't come this friday than I think I'm going to go home for the weekend because I want to sleep in my bed and have some good food and talk to my mom and my sister I need to ask karoline if she wants to go home this weekend too but she'll probably have architercture stuff to do I can't believe how much time she spends at the studio sometimes she's there till like three int the morning but I think she likes the other people there and one guy lives by her so she walks home with him inthe middle of the night - its kinda scary to walk around austin at night because there are a lot of weird people and you never know what could happen I was sort of scared last night when we left that arcade and were walking to the car I hope that I didn't scratch scotts door when it hit the curb because it made that awful noise 
__label__label0 I don't like computers really,  they are kind of a pain in the arse, but things are getting better, you know,  people learning new things, new methods of compression and technology makes you stop and thinks when is a computer going to be too fast. . my parents are okay too I guess they just aren't in the "loop:" as one might say,  always having to show them how or bring them up to date and shite, but . . school's fun, math is not okay. PROPNAME PROPNAME is awesome I'd love to meet one day. lot's of people listen to her, why should I be the only one to get to meet her?  carl thinks he can play bass, but he can. why?  why does jimmy stink?  why do people love anime so much?  ani is a hottie. often in class I find my self fantizing about what is would be like to meet her. just hang out with her and stuff. be all buddy buddy, get a fone call everyonce and a while and just see hwo things are going down. making sure she okay, even tho she's married,  I don't' think it will last, she's too free and out will mr. difranco is never around always at home,  I think it's first love syndrome. oh well. PROPNAME is awesome,  she's soo cute and so funny, and just awesome in everyway, she's not that much younger than me either,  she's very smart, and did I mention cute?  wish I knew what exactly she thought of me,  wouldn't I be wierd if who if anyone ever is reading this comes up to me in class and starts commenting on what I wrote?  that would be too freaky, this college is kinda stupid. first of all I'm not 00 yet so they won't let me get the fancy shmancy email account yet the other day they let me get a 0000 dollar loan which I have to pay off in 0 months or they sue me . . wacky oif you ask me, but then again who is?  this campus is so huge no one knows anyone around here, none of the professors, none of the students,  you smile at someone and immediately your somesort of wack job walking down the street stoopid people keep bothering me, don't they know I'm trying to write?   bno respect I tell you, none from no body not my parents, not my stoopid facking roommate who thinks he's my father,  him and his girlfriend I tell yoiu, first of all they are not very pretty people to begin with and then they are always here having sex and dammit it get annoying,  always trying to include us. not leaving alone when I don't want to ber apart of the picture. always is it okay if I don't this or we're goint to have sex now don't oing tin to the bed room I don't' car ego and getr phreaky don't tell me about it. ican't ccare less,  I just bugs the hell out of me when they decide, "well jason is feeling left out of our circle of love lets include him"  and I don't want to have any thing to do with them and when they are togheter it's fucking discussing. they act like fuckingh middle schoolers. always hopping and bopping about acting all like "I love you" I love yout oo let's have babies. holding hands and licking lips . never a moments rest of it,  it's enought to make you want to grab the rifle and end it one way or another. dammit . and carl always talking about how big his phallus is. I mean it's okay every once and a while. like on vacation and stuff. but every five minutes?  him I can tolerate,  go figure. ben used to be cool now he's just a useless pain in the arse. PROPNAME is pretty cool, but he's always going on about how everyone's gay and they should be proud of it. I mean it okay but when he tries to convince mne that all I know is gay everytime I see him it gets fucking annoyimg,  maybe I get annoyed to easil, not really things don't tend to annoy me,  just stoopid peole. people who don't know when to stop being stoopidn and take stoff as their own and well start being just there. I wish scarlett was here sute she did some questionable things but she was really cool about evertyhing I can't fart but carl can like the dickens pikachu, polemon is funny , tell you when they ge to talking and stuff it can make your day,  everything just falls in to place and you think to your self you know at least my vocabulary issn't just my name that would proabably suck. just jas ja jja jaosn on on jaos jaoson jaosn would get too annoy anyone eventually. what about people named al tnow that would suck for them. a a a a a all al al llll l l al al dman now speech for them. ca ca ca ca rl rl carl car lr rl rl it's pika chu dalkt  and would about those foregin peole. to summ it all up  I hat my life 
__label__label0 Life is so strange. For instance today I saw someone who lives right next to me that I haven't seen since I was in my hometown. I don't get guys at all. Why is it that guys can act so uninterested and be so rude? It's strange because if a girl likes a guy she thinks about him and talks to her friends about him and can't wait to hear from him, but guys act like they could care less and don't even call you for acouple of days and don't think anything of it. Why is that? When I have been talking to a guy and he doesn't call me it makes me feel unwanted and I tend to get pissed off. I miss my best friend in the whole world. He is at PROPNAME and my friend and I went and saw him last weekend but ever since I saw him I have been missing him more because I guess I remembered how much he ment to me. The whole thing with this guy I'vebeen talking to is that he doesn't act interesting and because of it he makes me question myself and has caused me to be homesick and yern for letters and calls from my parents and all of my friends from back home. It's strange how certain things trigger you to feel a certain way. I've been eating a lot of sweet stuff today and I've decided that once you've tasted something sweet you keep craving more until you're out of it or you leave the room. My roommate is nice, but she and I have a wierd relationship. We get along fine, but she isn't what I would call a good friend. That is one of the reasons I am never in my dorm room. Why is it that people can be so mean to eachother? I don't like to be mean to other people especially if I don't know them but there are peole out there who will be maen and not even care about it. I also don't get why friends think they should lie to eachother. As a friend you're supposed to be there for someone no matter what, but if your friendis lying to you it makes it so much harder to forgive them once you find out. Some of my closest friends did this to me and now because ofit I don't even associate with them. I don't understand why people feel theneed to drink all the time also. Who says that in order to have a good time we must drink. I met this guy yesterday at dinner who asked my friend and I if we drank and continued to tell us how stupid it was because as children we have fun and do things just because, but as adults we must get dunkk in order to have a good time. I have never felt that I could justify drinking and I still don't. I have drank a few times but just as an experiment, not every weekend. It is crazy to me the number ofpeople who drink on a regualr basis. My friend at PROPNAME has been known to drink and that bothers me considerably because I don't want to seem him get addicted or get hurt. His father has a drinking problem and I worry that will have an effect on him. My friend PROPNAME is so sweet we have just recently become good friends and we have so much fun together. She is one of those people who could care less what others thought so she just says "hi" to people on the street. THat's one of the reasons I enjoy her so much is because she makes me feel like it's ok to just be nice and friendly to everyone and not worry whether or not htey think I'm crazy for doing it or not. My mother get's on my case about everything and nags me all the time. I know she's just trying to look after me and keep me safe, and it doesn't help that I'm an only child but, sometimes I can't handle all of her questions and concerns. I wish she'd just relax and let me live. Don't get me wrong she's the greatest and I wouldn't change her for anything I just think it's time to start seperating what she thinks I should do and what I want to do. Life is funny we go through it trying to make something of ourselve and live up to everyones standards when really we should just live up to our own and try and be happy and make some great friends along the way and hopefully help a fewpeople along the way. Like yesterday I was walking and this guy in a wheelchair was trying to wheel himself up a hill and he was strugglinng. somone asked him for help and he accepted. More people in the world should just do little acts like that that help one person out so they don't have to struggle so much. 
__label__label1 I am thinking of all the things I have to get done today and how I don't' have anything else to think about. there is so much to get done here and I only got behind one day. dang it this reminds me that I haven't gone to mezes to sign up for anything yet. so I better go get that done tomorrow. RTF reading. shakespeare reading. psych reading. bio reading. art history reading and journal. dang, I guess I could do some of it during dinner, but I told PROPNAME that I'd go with her. I woldn't want to be rude so I guess I'll do it all when I come back. mm, dinner. I'm hungry. wonder what we are having. it better be better than lunch. at least the salad bar was stocked up. I hate it when its not because that is one of the only safe options that there is. Mark comes up to see me on Saturday. I wonder if we'll ever get any alone time. I hope he gets here late because I'll need to sleep during the day because of my pledge retreat on Friday/sat morning. OH I need to call someone about a sleeping bag. shoulld write a note about that, would if I weren't typing all my thoughts out. this is weird. I've never had to do anything like this. wonder if 00 minutes is up, nope 0 minutes. I think a lot in 0 minutes. maybe that is why I talk so much. probably. anyway. I wonder what is on comedy central. I shouldn't turn the tb on because then I won't be thinking anything at all. I'll be all zombie. I'm feeling such frustration now because I really don't want to be doing this and I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I should have done this much earlier when I was feeling okay and had stuff to think about. now all I have to think about it complaining because I don't feel well, don't want to be doing this and I'm hungry and don't want to eat cafeteria food. hey I could order a pizza, but don't really want to spend my money. I should get a job. Wonder if I can fit 00 hrs of work into my schedule. lets see if I worked 0 hrs that's only 0 days of work. no I really don't want to do so much right now. I'll wait till next semester till I have a better idea on what I am doing and how to handle college life. plus I have meetings on 0 days of the week. maybe 0 if I do rha. but teachign dance again woudl be fun. I could contact them and just talk to them. yeah I think I'll do that tomorrow. plus it will keep me in shape. since I'm not taking any dance training right now. about 0 more minutes then I can go eat. I also need to get a haircut. I'll do that tomorrow too. oh and I need to get this printer working. maybe I'll wait till mark comes so I don't screw it up. yeah I think that's what I'll do. only about 0 more whole days till he gets here. I wonder if we are doing the right thing by staying together while at college. It feels right but it sure does hurt when we have to leave. And what is a healthy amount of time to see each other that we won't be intruding?  I don't want ot not see him but I want ot have a life of my own here and its hard to get involved when you are with your boyfriend all the time. maybe I'll drag him to that party on sat. I think he'll have fun. I should really ask first before I make plans. I'm rambling. I always ramble. kerri is done with her psych. I should start mine after I get done with this assignment and the other one. I really hope the other one is easier than this one. if my head wasn't so foggy maybe I wouldn't ramble so much. but then I ramble when I talk too so nevermind. my throat still hurts. I hope that goes away soon. it sucks to be sick when you have so much studying to do not to mention the other things I have to get doen. I should make me a list. I think I'll do that after I eat. k almost done  I hope I didn't make katrina mad when I didn't write back to her. I guess she'll have to just understand that I have way too much to do. oh well. I wonder when it'll get cold. I can't stand this hot weather and its so freezing it the room that I have to wear a long sleeved shirt. but then again maybe its just because I'm sick. wonder if kerri is also cold. oh the 00 minuts is up. food. 
__label__label0 I survived . . so far. I think I'll do alright in college. I was thinking today that maybe I should have gone to UTA. Oh well. I met people from LOCNAME today. It was great. I don't think I've said it enough but I LOVE "Beautiful Thing"!!  It's a great movie. I know I saw PROPNAME's name today on a sewer lid, and I wasn't being paranoid. I really should talk to Kent soon. I miss him. I was on the verge of tears telling the psychologist about PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. It still hurts. I'm afrain not to take my meds. I can't wait to fall in love. Sometimes though I get very scared that I might mess someone else's life like mine. I have quite a bit of baggage and I'm not sure if anyone will go through. I miss PROPNAME. Damn allergies just hit me today. Peppermint Foot Lotion. Abuelita PROPNAME . . I wonder how she's doing. PROPNAME & Seehum were so cute. "I'm going to make it afterall!"  My frog makes a good pillow. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. She left for LOCNAME yesterday. I realized today I don't care what I do later in life as long as I have kids, friends, a nice house, and someone who'll always love me and be there when I die. Am I going to Hell?  I still don't know. Mr. PROPNAME would say I'm as good as damned now. Dying has so much stress attached to it. Maybe that's why I could never go through with it. I know that if I went back to a place like PROPNAME I'd give up and stay there forever or at least a month or two. I wouldn't care at all this time. I don't dream very much anymore. At least I don't remember them. I sleep so well during the day but it's harder at night. It's that damned melotonin crap. Commie Bastards!  Oh well. God I wish my nose would stop dripping. I miss PROPNAME sooooooo much!  God bless her. 
__label__label1 Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in PROPNAME, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  
__label__label1 The way I feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. I have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. To be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. Currently I feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. I live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. The people at Jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than I. I don't believe I am as happy about being in college for this reason. I love meeting new people. I find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends I left behind. I seem to dwell on the past lately. I go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. I work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. I many times dwell onthe question "Why do I not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. "  I guess part of the reason I feel this way is simply because as a child I was teased about being overweight. I guess I developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. I've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. It is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. Personally I tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. I also worry excessively about my grades. I guess from reading what I wrote my biggest feeling/emotion is lonliness. 
__label__label1 Well here I am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always, constantly hitting the backspace key. I just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books I have is signifigantly cheaper there and then I registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like I could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade at the going away dance only for eighth graders I won a bag of blowpops huge bag and I never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer I would find one and throw it away. My roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already I'm still just kind of trudging along. I'm really tired its time to go to bed I wonder if I should take advil because I had my wisdom teeth out on friday but I'm really tolerant to pain so I never even took the perscription pain medication- but I have no idea if anything is wrong because I just sort of ignore the pain. After I finish this I am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she doesn't know who of her friends will be here so he might stay in our dorm but I know that they won't do anything I'm probably going home because I live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it won't bother me he's a nice guy- I have only known jenny for 0 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too. We both grew up in the LOCNAME with parents from LOCNAME so we have similar backgrounds. I filled out that survey it was so strange and so long. The pre-test thing. I'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives I'm such an innocent and I don't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions. One of our suite mates rushed and she got into ORGNAME and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and I asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because it's the first day of school and she has an 0:00 class tommorow but oh well it's not might life or my concern. this room is so cold. and she seems so smart to she took all the ORGNAME classes and I think she was on drill team too. And she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok I don't need a guy to make me happy even though I would like a boyfriend- I've never had one before that is so strange but that's ok. I saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that's ok. There are a few of us from church here also PROPNAME who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my differentials on norton or something- my brother like ICQed me and told me to do it at least once a week I had no ide what he was talking about and I tried to do it. I can't believe I have so much to do already I have a lot of classes I thought it would kind of be like high school but I don't think so I saw a few people around campus that I know from church it was really weird thinking I knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 00 minutes early but that won't last long- especially those 0 o'clock classes oh I think I need to charge my cell phone I'm not sure oh well. well I think my twenty minutes is up and I'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so I guess I could read sociology until she is done but. well good night. 
__label__label1 I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 00 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 0:00 to 00:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 00 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 00,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend PROPNAME who goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 0 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! 
__label__label0 I like to hear music. For some reason, I recently discovered old rock, specifically the group ORGNAME ORGNAME. Their songs evoke strange feelings of relaxation within me. Why though? I suppose the smoothness of the words accompanied by the awesome guitar. I am reminded of the lyrics "so do you think you can tell, Heaven and Hell, Blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?. cold comfort for change. how I wish you were here, were just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears, wish you were here. " PROPNAMEPROPNAME PROPNAME's song "Wish You Were Here. "      I find myself relaxed yet down though. I am disturbed somewhat from the words; but, why am I feeling relaxed. I think it is from the awesome music and pitch of the singer's voice. Their exotic, at least to me, beginning seems to subliminally evoke depth of thinking even though the words may seem stupid. But, the part of the song I enjoy the most is the fishbowl analogy. I think it is ingenious and I am reminded of myself and my inability to find the right girl of my dreams. For some reason, the analogy portion evokes a sort of chivalric ambition within me. I desire a bit of love and romance from a special person that I want to meet. the perfect girl. Someone with the same aspirations as me. A person that when I look into her eyes I find myself lost. Yet, physically, the act of looking into her eyes would have no physical affect to me in the real world. silly.      Anyway, I am aware that PROPNAME PROPNAME took drugs and were possibly high while writing this song. I do not condone to taking drugs. In fact I dispise drugs. They ruin lives and for what. So you can loose your mind for a couple of minutes and kill yourself. The best way to counter drugs is not to try them at all. Abstinence from drugs and getting drunk is the best things in life, at least I think so. I don't need to get myself drunk at a party to have a good time. I just need to go regularly and I will have an awesome time. I am reminded of a party I went to a few weeks back. This is a disco party where you dance with girls. I went to the party and was dancing and having a good time. Unfortunately, the other guys needed to get drunk to dance. So, they all went outside to get drunk and came back in. They were the biggest loosers I have ever seen in my life. I suppose they don't have enough self esteem to go out and dance with the girls. Unfortunately, I feel that I miss out because I tend to do the right thing. That is why I am rarely invited to parties. In my whole highschool experience, I have only been to two parties. Pathetic huh!     Anyway I look forward to college to meet some nice girls that will like me for being myself, the good guy. This paper will self destruct after you read it! just kiddin' 
__label__label0 I'm really hungry. I'll have to go shopping after this. I don't know what to write. I really need to catch up on my reading today. I don't know why I always leave things to the last minute. I was going to try to keep up with things this year but I'm not doing a real goodd job. I have to do computer science tommorrow. that will be easy. I should have called darcie and megan this weekend and hung out with them. kyle should have come up too. I'm surprised I got mike to come hang out last night since he almost never leaves his apartment. I really want to go smoke but I probably shouldn't. I need to cut down. I wish I could think of a place to put these stickers. I had to kill a spider but I missed him. what weas up with all those spider questions in the pretesting. pretesting took a long time. and it seemed like a lot of pointless questions. I need to go sign up for experiments. there sure are a lot of beer cans lying around. I need to get everything cleaned up in here. I haven't finished unpacking yet. I have to go look for a job tommorrow. I wish I didn't have to work, but it will be good for me. I won't waste so much time hopefully. damn, I haven't been writing very long. I hate doing these things cause if I'm thinking about writing everything I think, then I don't think normally. I wrote think too much. there's so much shit I have to do. and I don't want to do it. I'll probably end up not doing any homework again today just cause I don't have to have it done yet. I can't wait to get out of school. I wonder if anyone will actually read this. if so, what's up. I'm getting tired of writing. I'm so hungry. I should start clipping coupons to take with me. I guess it'll make a big difference and I don't have a lot of money. I wonder what my sister's doing.  I should start taking some more pictures. I haven't really done any of that for a while. I wonder what's on that roll of film in my camera. it's been in there so long I don't know what I took pictures of. okay about five more minutes. shit. I wonder where I should try to get a job. hopefully something fun but I don't know what. I feel like I should have more written down for twenty minutes. oh well at least I did something. I don't want to write anymore. 
__label__label1 I am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time I really feel like crying right now. I don't know what is wrong with me . I don't want to go back to school I really hate it there. I really just wish that I could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. I just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but I may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if I will be at a different school in a month. atleast I have PROPNAME there with me at school I am only happy when I am with him but I can't be with him all the time I have got to live my own life. he says that if I hate the dorm so much that I should move in with him but I am really scared to , I think because I am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if I change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and I believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what I want. I am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when I first moved to austin . I know that I cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. I am scared to talk to her about anything because I am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. I wish I was good at talking back to people and that I wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but I can't help it I don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. I don't want to make them mad at me but what can I say . the few times that I did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like I am freaking out. why are people so mean. I am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok I don't even understand myself. I just want to be happy and I am not happy right now and now that I am home I want to go back to school because I feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. I will figure it all out one day  
__label__label0 Well hello, it is not that late but it feels that way, I wonder what is awaiting me in the jester mail room. a package, a big one at that from my mother. "some thing for you to hold on to" she says. what might that be?  a teddy bear. I hope it is something interesting. now I am so excited I can not slleep. well this and also the fact that I slept for 0 hours this after noon and missed psychology. thank goodness I checked my e-mail, which is a rarety. I'm becoming stressed with calculus, devil class, I will fail and if I do I will take an easy summer course at home and pass with no stress, should be doing homework, this is homework!!!! this homework is fun I could get used to this, but it would be better is someone was listening. listening listening, should I be listening to my inner voice saying to drop out of school because it is too hard for the likes of me??? I will just have to work harder than the average bear   bear, how funny ,  teddy bear, I wander what my package is. is brian going to come to see me this weekend with my family, do I want him to  he will say no, I bet. that is just him  I wander if my typing is keeping tina awake.

I am as sure as I could be at this point in life life that is forced forcing me to go to school to be affraid to lose what I reallywant, what anyone really wants is obsolete who cares waht you want!!!!!!!  its what you have to do no matter what the cost, your sanity, who cares one more mentally instable person join the club the prozac club, the zoloft club, the effexor club, did I mention that pre-pharmacyis my major the major that occupies this forced atmosphere, not physically but mentally my own mental judge pushing pushing pushing my self no one else has made this impossi\ble only myself my mind, foam club tomarrow in bikini to get in free, is this fun I'm excited I hope my so-called friend decides to take a few more people so-called not = to negative meaning only question of the true meaning of friend I want to be perfect in every single way humanly and inhumanly possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! put me in an experiment!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
__label__label0 What should I write. hmmm well I'm kinda feeling tired right now and hungry. Went bolwing till about 0 am last night and havent really had anything to eat yet. In about an hour me and a few people from the dorm are going out to a LOCNAME restaurant to eat since all the cafeterias are closed for dinner on sunday. I hear people talking in the hallway about going to play paint ball on monday. I think I am going to go. I've never played paint ball but I've heard it's pretty cool. Hopefully it wont last that long because I was planning on doing some reading for my classes. something always comes up to keep you from studying. oh and I have calculus homework to do also. damn. my calculus teacher is French and has not mastered the English language but really who has in the mathematics department. Tuesday is a busy day so I don't think ill get much done then. all the clubs I signed up for meet on Tuesday. there are five days in the week and lets say take out friday to make four possible days to have a meeting and they all choose the same day. just my luck. Ill just have to choose which oraganization seems the best. hm well is my 00 minutes up. yup 
__label__label1 I really don't have many thoughts right now, other than the fact that I get to go home this weekend. I really can't wait, and what is this song going on behind me?  Anyway, like I was saying, I get to see PROPNAME, she's my girlfriend. I miss her so much, but that's okay. I think about her constantly. For example, when I am in classes, I think about her all the time. No offense Dr. P. , but I do!  Anyway, I love this song that's on right now. I really wish these people would quit Instant Messaging me!  I get so tired of hearing my little ding in the back going off telling me someone is there!  Oh well, I guess it's my fault for being so damn friendly. That's okay though. I miss my little sister. I can't wait to see her. She is the most prescious thing to me right now, other than my studies. Who the heck is blaring their music. I am trying to do my work and they think everyone has to hear their damn music. That's okay though. I understand, I like music. Man, there isn't much room on this little space to write for twenty minutes. You should really reconsider and make us write for like ten minutes instead of twenty. That's okay though. I don't mind. It's not like I'm whining or something. Anyway, where is PROPNAME?  He never has this late of a day. Hmm, I wonder. Wow, PROPNAME PROPNAME is so pretty. Just too bad everyone has to dog her because she's successful and they aren't. I hate it when people do that. Oh well, I guess it's what makes the world go round. I don't know, I don't have all of the answers. I guess really no one does. I wonder why PROPNAME decided to talk to me of all people?  That was really weird. She's pretty though. I wouldn't mind getting to know her as a friend. She's really sweet, or so it seems. I love meeting new people. I guess that is why I chose this school, well at least one of my many reasons. I love college. So far, that is. I can't wait to meet more people. Wow, my twenty minutes is almost up. I can't believe it. I really can't wait to go home. I'm not homsick, but I am really wanting to see PROPNAME. See, there I go again, thinking about her. I can't stop thinking about her. I love her with all of my heart. I would never do anything to hurt her. I know that she knows that and I know that she wouldn't hurt me either. Man, these chairs hurt. I wish I had a cushion for it. That's okay though. I am thristy now. I need some lemonade. I guess I'll have to make some. I'm out. 
__label__label0 At this very moment I am feeling slightly depressed. My roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. That's great. The first weekend of school and she decides to go home. She left me all alone even for the first football game. It's not that I am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. It gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. I'm also a little stressed. Moving to college has been fine for me. I haven't gotten home sick, really. And I'm having a lot of fun. But adjusting to how much work I have now is hard. I one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. That's impossible here. And if your not computer literate your screwd. So that means that I am screwed. But on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. I have no option if I want to succeed. Succeeding is important. I was valedictorian of my high school. I think that is a curse. It seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. And it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. I want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. I hope it happens. I really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. He is 00 and lives in LOCNAME. What a bummer. Not that he is 00 but that he lives in LOCNAME. It is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. Most of the time I don't know how to read him. What is he thinking?  That worries me most of the time. I don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. We once got into a fight and he told me that I had become to dependent on him. That really pissed me off. I don't believe that I had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. Bored because he had moved and I had nothing else going on at the time. How dare he call me dependent. How am I suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to LOCNAME and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. Dependent my ass!  It just really irritates me. But I don't know what to think about it. Moments like these, when I'm all alone is when I miss him the most. And I try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time I can't help it. then I have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. Its him that has the problem. Why does he have to be so independent?  I don't believe that someone can be totally independent. Everyone from one time to another needs someone. Everyone. So why does he have to act as if he doesn't. I wonder if my time is up yet. I honestly don't think that this has helped me much. Its just made me think more. Great. yes my time is up. good. 
__label__label0 what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people. I do miss having my sister in the same city as me she really has meant a lot to me in the past few years and I do wish she was here. but then again I am loving all of my freedom here. have not talked to my mom in a few days and I like it she is not hounding me to do anything. niether is my grandmother. wonder why kellys dad wanted to talk to me. do miss kelly a little but hopefully we can still be friends  wonder what nicole is doing right now. this is the third time I tried to write but the other tow trys I go restless and stop writing. really did not know what to say but now I am just hoping it is not to late for these writing assignments. always seem to wait till the last minute. I cna hear thoughts in my mind but don't know how to put them into words. or which one should I write about first. lunch was good and now I am feeling better because I got something to eat. don't want to work anymmore at eddie bauer because I don't like it anymore and I don't want to work there because I may have something better to do and plus I hope I can find someone to work for me tomarrow so I can go to the training session to be an offical for intermural football. hope my family is doing ok have not heard from them lately. still have ten minutes to write. my mind is completly blank I keep thinking about this book we read last year in english it was written in stream of thought. hope the professer got my email about the brain test to see if a person is right or left brained. nose itches. relly wish we did not have to do this. or at least not for so long. ok sitting like this is not the easiet  ok that is better. morrre comfortable. hope miriam can go this weekend to george carlin have not talked to her in a week and hope everything is going good with her. my neighbors are wierd they play some stange fucked up music. hope I do good on my quiz tommarow I need to study and catch up on my readings. need to know when my calculus test is. and my eco. test. hope the pysc test is not soon. really need to catch up on some reading. hope nicold can everything taken care of so she is not so stressed out.

I want to meet nwe people and who know the right woman may be out ther but right now I think she is the one. ok good time is up. 
__label__label0 I am sitting thinking about how I have a headache, and how I am not hungry but I have a desire to eat because it is lunchtime. I am keeping an eye out for the evil ants that rule our dorm room. I think my roomate is sexy. I am havig a hard  time relaxing and just writing I stop and pause to think of what I am thinking. my long nails make it hard to type my hair is falling out in droves. tompetty is in a week and a half I love tom petty. vh0 is on and is starting to get annoying I am going to turn it off, that's better. I have a tough time managing my time correctly I need to make changes I feel heavy I feel hungry, I would rather be surfing the web or checking my email than writing this but it's required I think there is something wrong with my computer it is acting weird I think it is juno's fault. my glands hurt my instant messenger is broken.

__label__label0 I can't ever seem to remember my passwords. And this lack of remembrance has really started to effect my disposition. Everytime I try to log on to a computer, I can't remember one password from the other and it has gotten to the point where I just want to kick myself in the head. Most of the time I just want to lie down and go to sleep. People keep on staying over in my apartment and I just can't get any sleep in the night. I can't survive with this for much longer. Sometimes, I wish I was going to a faraway place where no one knows me and I can remain anonymous forever. I don't have to wash dishes for my roommates friends or clean up after anyone. I also wish that my parents would trust me everyonce in a while. I know my limits. I care enough about myself and my future to not screw it up. Before, I didn't care about much anything but lately I've come to realize this lack of compassion, even for a moment, has adverse effects. I've come to realize that every second matters and every second can be utilized and it is only when you are satisfied that you were ahead in some way this second than the last is the only way to truly be content. Humans, especially the ones here, are really ignorant of some basic kindness. They seem to forget that they are not the only ones with feelings. And they also think that they know nothing of what they are doing to you when they know perfectly clear. Butterfly in the sky. I think most birds can fly twice as high. I was sitting in the chem auditorium in welch and it just hit me the magnitude of this university. It's freaking huge. there are more people in that auditorium then in my graduating class. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome. All this typing since the last 0 years constantly plus all the ones in the next 00 years will have some sort of negative effect. I want to dye my hair brown. but then I'll be just like every other Indian. there are more indians here than in all of the rest of america combined. After caucasians, indians seem most prevalent. dell and gates signed a deal for a huge merger. it was one of those things which I don't really care about. everyone makes fun of gates but I don't see why. the man is worth billions. he could have people killed. at the moment, there's no one I'd like to injure severely, I think I just might want to kick a few of them in the head. 
__label__label1 I am an architecture major. Therefore I do not sleep. Last night I was able to sleep simple because I couldn't go any longer without closing my eyes. I wish that I had the choice to fall asleep and wake up at will. That time would simply stop when my head hit the pillow (or drafting table) so that I wouldn't lose any work time. If this were so, life would be much easier. Without taking time out of my life to shower, eat or sleep I could get everything done. What is the true purpose of bathing anyway? I mean, I do it for the simple fact that I'm told by society that it's necessary for me to be accepted by the general populous. But, in all reality, if we didn't shower none of us would know the difference. I think that's my main complaint about the world in which we live. There is too much LOCNAME. Why can't it just be I, sometimes? Rather than worry constantly about what PROPNAME might wear or what PROPNAME might do with her hair, why can't we just live and experience and BE without the everpresent pressure of impression and attitude. When, I'm inclined to wonder, did everyone begin to care so much about TRYING so damn hard to lose their own individuality. What's the most disgusting, I believe, is that there are those out there who try so hard to find their own that, eventually, even THAT catches on, and then, once again, they become part of a click or group. Here in lies my love and passion for architecture. But, it will also be my crutch, and possibly my ultimate failure. With it I can create and design and people will experience what I'm feeling and they won't be able to say, "Wow, that's cool, why don't I do that," without enlisting my services. (In a perfect world) They will, however, be able to say "Wow, that's cool (or awful as the case may be) I want to be in this space. " On the opposite note, however, the only way I'll be able to express myself through my work will be to appeal to the masses or at least a mass large enough to want to pay me to build my building. So, in order for me to survive and be able to be different and interesting, I will have to find a group of people that are on the same wavelength as I am, which is essentially what I'm trying to avoid. It's a Catch00 and there's no way around it. I suppose I could step to the side and be a PROPNAME PROPNAME of the world and live day by day surviving off the few people who may honor my integrity and desire for design, but, just like everyone else, I crave human contact and acceptance. I am too afraid of myself to be myself. I am too afraid to find out that I don't know what I am or to realize that everything I thought was, I'm really the opposite of and have only been playing a game my entire life, just trying to make an impression. I am so scared that I really am a failure, but somehow I've been lucky. Somehow, I pulled off those SAT's and I pulled off those straight A's, but as soon as I find out who I really am, I'll fall off of this full speed train toward success and end up in a field somewhere surrounded by no one. I don't even want to be successful anymore. I don't even want to be anymore. I just want to experience. I just want to know and think without the pressure of success or failure. I'm not sure what we're all trying for, but I do know that whatever it is, can wait until we've died. 
__label__label0 I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some PROPNAME. I hope she helps PROPNAME pay for that car she wants. But PROPNAME also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad PROPNAME is getting that car, ORGNAME's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 000 days, he was very proud and said that "a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. " I was happy about that. I just wish that my dad was as proud, and understanding of how hard this is, and what a real accomplishment this is. 
__label__label1 My feet are killing me. Why am I doing this. My feet sting, I think I'm going to put something on them. Those sandals are horrible. I'm never wearing those again. We have to walk all the way back to class in 00 minutes. This song on my computer kicks ass. I can't wait to go to Elements tonight and pick up some tail. That would be nice. I miss her though. But I wonder if she feels the same way about things right now. I have no idea. I always think about this. I don't know what to do. I love her. I want to go clubbing. I want to get really drunk tonight. I can't cheat on her, but is she saying the same thing. We love each other, I know it. I need to get my mind off of that situation right now. I got to start studying more. She studies all the time. Fuck I did it again. Shift your thoughts to something else. Do it. Okay I need to study when we get back from Psychology class. I got to read Chapter 0 in Economics, and read some Art History. After that I need to call PROPNAME, then get ready and go get drunk. I need to wake up early tomorrow to get a job. God I'm so lazy. I can't believe I slept until one today. This writing what's on my mind stuff is pretty weird, its starting to get kind of boring. I wonder if he's even going to read what's on my mind. Well, it doesn't really matter this paper is pretty stupid. I would get kind off scared if I had to read 000 of these papers. I think I'm going to quit writing this assignment now just cause I don't feel like doing it, and I want to test how long it will take for someone to read this. When whoever who's reading this gets to this point, count how many days it has been since September 00,0000. I would like to know how long it has been so please email me at solomon00@mail. utexas. edu. If you would like I got five more minutes to get back to what I'm thinking right now. Right now I'm thinking that I want to get a drink of water, have a snuff, walk to class, sit next to some hot girl, get her number, and take her out tonight. Wow, I think I just answered my question that I was thinking at the beginning of the page, or did I? I'm tired of writing this, it's just making my girlfriend problem worse. I quit. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm thinking about the situation I am going through with my two roommates. School has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. I really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. I'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers I am beginning to encounter. I can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. I hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. I also miss my mom very much. Even though I don't talk to her everyday on the phone, I can hear speaking to me with her heart. The same thing goes for me too. My classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. I don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. It really is a big change for me being here at a university. Back home school was a breeze. Now I can actually feel that I'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. The good side to that is that I like challenges. One of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to LOCNAME. There isn't anything wrong with that because heORGNAME "in love". I hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. I really care about him and I wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. Although, I have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. Either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. My other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. I miss them all the time but I know that me being here is the best thing for me. For some reason I can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME because she is attending ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME. There has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there. 
__label__label1 Going off to college for me was the chance for a new beginning, a fresh start. A makeover. All the things I disliked about myself could be fixed. Or so I hoped. Unfortunately, the thing about myself that I hate the most and has plagued me for so many years has managed to follow me here as well despite my efforts to escape it and start over. PROPNAME. It hurts my relationships with others as well as myself physically. I thought that the gross puking that occurs after I eat too much would magically disappear when I became a healthy college student. But it hasn't and now my roommates are on to me. But I'm not supposed to know. Instead I just get to imagine what awful things they are thinking of me and know that every time I put food in my mouth they think I'll throw it up. And they don't even know because they haven't even asked me about it. They just speculate and have apparently come to the conclusion that I'm bulimic. Which I'm not. Yes, I have a problem that I need to take control of. But I don't appreciate the way they're going about the whole thing. My roommate, who has known me for the past three years and is aware of my condition, could actually believe them. And she didn't even ask me. Instead, she picks up the phone and calls my boyfriend. I'm going to see him tomorrow and I was so excited but now I have to deal with this. She has to go worrying him like this. But he won't worry. My loving, caring boyfriend will instead contemplate breaking up with me. He won't have anything to do with a bulimic girl  and I'm not one. I really care about him. He's my best friend. I miss him so much. I just always fear that my problems will drive him away. I wish I were more confidant and more everything. But I can't help the way I feel or the way I am. And I really need him. He makes me so much happier and healthier. But I'm not as dependent as I sound. I really had no idea how much he meant to me until I left him. And I'm always afraid that he won't feel the same. I know that we'll break up eventually, but I hope he's right about us always being friends. That is so important to me. And maybe one day we'll find out that we're meant for each other. I do believe that there is one special person that I'm supposed to marry. God has a plan for my life. But I am totally clueless as to what it is. And you know I'll never know if I don't invest any time in Him. I need to get my life in order the way I planned to the day I moved off to college. 
__label__label0 I have to my homework. I have to study for my chemistry and history. I have to go to LOCNAME this Thursday, so I wont attend class. I have so much shit to do. my mind is going blank right now. oh yeah. I have to go home and clean the dishes, wash my clothes, wake up at 0:00am, get ready and because of my homework I will not be able to go to sleep until 00:00. Tomorrow first thing in the morning, I have to pay my tuition bill of 0 dollars, go to the bookstore and buy my precal book and psy. book. right after I type this I have to go to ORGNAME and do some grocery shopping. since I have no food at home I will buy milk, cereal, junk food, chips, pizza, juice, Gatorade, water, bathroom, paper, tilex mildew stain remover. this is hurting my neck. it really hurts. I need to go home and go to sleep I will be so happy after I get this assignment done; I will be done with at least one of my homework for school. I feel so tired right now; I just want to go home and go to sleep. I cannot stand being here [library] any longer than I have to. 
__label__label0 Last Saturday, my parents sold the house that I have lived in my entire life. Even though it has been on the market for over a year, I was very upset. It seems to me as though my family is falling apart. I have three siblings, and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities. And since the place that my parents are moving to doesn't have rooms for us, where I am right now is my home now. Where my brothers and sister live is their home now, and it doesn't feel like we are a family anymore. Because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically. Even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown, LOCNAME, we couldn't. There are six of us in my family, and my parents only have one extra bedroom. My sister only has one extra bedroom, so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent's when we are in LOCNAME. It's so weird. I don't even know what I'm going to do when I drive past the house. I'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking. I do things like that all the time. Without thinking, one day, I drove to my best friend's house because I was thinking of her, and she wasn't even in town. I just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want. They are so excited about simplifying their lives, but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof. My family is the most important thing in my life, and I don't want that to change. I guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings. They were close friends with their siblings, and now they barely talk to each other. Now that my siblings and I are beginning to make families of our own, I don't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now. I've gone through life making friends and growing apart, and it has been really hard on me, but my family has always been there. Without that solid relationship, I don't know how life is going to be. 
__label__label1 0:00 twenty minutes to write what I am thinking Well, I am writing this at a time when I should be in class, but at least I am doing my homework. Between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, I think I have this class covered. I must admit I hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. When ever I get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, I can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. Don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. The guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. I know him, and has just said hello, The only reason I know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is Hot. Holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. This is really fucked up. I am trying to evesdrop as I write this. He is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. Why does she date hIM? He's so nasty. I'm hungry, I ate not to long ago, maybe I want a cigarette. Busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument NAZI. He was on the sick out we all hate him. Some dude I don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, It was funny, I am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. I am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. I am hungry, I wonder what happened in class today I'll just read the next chapter of the book, I like the book it is interesting. Lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell Friday, actually every day is good when I am not in class and don't have anything to do. The dude next to me started talking to me, I hate him, I don't even know what he said. Hey 0:00 see you bye 
__label__label1 When I first thought about the stream of consciousness writing assignment, I figured my natural stream of consciousness would deliver my views on life and the issues that apply to the everyday. However, all I've been able to think about in the past twenty minutes is a girl. Her name is PROPNAME. We became close towards the end of the summer before I came back to LOCNAME. She lives in LOCNAME so its hard to get to see her very often. One date was all it took. I mean I've known the girl for years, but it became different after this one night. Kind of going from childhood friends to, I don't know, maybe something romantic. If I had known anything was there, I would've stomped on this opportunity a long time ago kind of like if I had known that there were 0 very essential vitamins in California Style Sunny Delight, I would've drunk that my whole life instead of orange juice. When did they come out with Sunny Delight anyways? I don't think it's been around for my entire life but probably pretty close. Possibly when I was five or six years old. At any rate, I always think to myself  could this girl be the one? She's beautiful to start with, and besides that, she's just amazing. I can't spend enough time with that girl. Just going to the playground and swinging with her makes me happy. I got a call from her the other day saying she was going to come see me next weekend. This could possibly be why I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. I really can't wait to see her. Possibly more excited than going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm just packing up my bags and heading down there to see if I can land a job at a local ski resort. I've always wanted to ski bum for a season, so I figured this would be a good chance. And being that the summer in our hemisphere is winter in their hemisphere, it works out  having all summer off. I was actually stressing about this all day being that it has to be in by 0 o clock. I'm leaving for College Station sometime today and I have got so much to do. A police officer gave me a speeding ticket two nights ago on LOCNAME. Now I have to take defensive driving and get my car inspected to get out of this ticket. And this, piled onto everything else that is going on. I'd say my stress level has recently risen to a 0! Nonetheless, I'm getting out of town this weekend and probably the next too. The swells are getting up to 0 feet on the LOCNAME gulf coast this weekend which is unheard of around here, so I want to get out and catch some waves before they recede. Surfing just makes me relax  puts me in a zone where there are no worries. Soccer doesn't do that for me. I played all my life and it was very fun but also came with a lot of pressure. There were many reasons I guess, but I just played to play, not to win a state championship or anything. Well I guess my twenty minutes are up, time to take a shower! 
__label__label0 I feel really good today because it is my birthday. I'm looking forward to being with my friends later on today. I'm thinking about tonight because my fraternity is having a match with the ZETAs. I'm pretty excited about it because they are the hottest girls I've seen so far. I kind of would like to go home though and see some of my friends back home. A lot of them are making trips back home this weekend to see some concert. I also would like to see my family on my birthday but I am sure I will see them soon. I don't really know what else I should write about except my birthday because it's all I have been thinking about this week. I plan to go pre party after I finish this writing assignment. So far I am loving it here in LOCNAME and am really glad I chose to come school up here. The size of my classes is quite a surprise and something I just have to get used to. I really enjoy having all the freedom here compared to back home in LOCNAME. I wish I had more time to just hang out but I stay really busy lately. Being a pledge in a fraternity really can be time consuming but it is worth it. I've met so many people these last three weeks and I'm sure it will be the same for the rest of the semester. Now I'm beginning to draw blank and can't think of much to write. Oh well, it's not like anyone will actually read this passage. I've got five minutes left on my time. I am so glad to be out of high school. College is much better though there is a lot of work to be done. My date better look good tonight in her eighties outfit for the party. The theme is an eighties prom but I just went got some clothes that look like their from the eighties. I can't wait to see what other people are going to be wearing. Well time is up. 
__label__label0 College life is so much different than anything that I have ever experienced in my life. It is so neat how you come here knowing so few people, and by the third week you are best friends with a group of guys from some place you have never heard of. I would never have guessed that I would get a roommate that is engaged and is never here, or break up with my girlfriend, or even meet so many different people. What is so neat about it is that you meet somebody new every day. You meet those people, then you meet their friends, and then their friends, and before you know it you have this huge network of people that you thought you would never meet. The other thing about college that was different was the incredible urge within me to surround myself with people that I previously did not know. That is why I broke up with my girlfriend. I was being stubborn and was thinking to myself that there are so many women here and I will find somebody else. Sure there are plenty of other people here, but not one has been as cool as PROPNAME was. Now I can't decide if I want to get back with her or if I want to stick it out and find someone different. When thinking about this decision, the saying, "don't fix it if it ain't broke" always comes into my head. We were happy together and we had fun, so why should I not stay with her. Then again we did have our bad times and there are so many other people here at LOCNAME. I don't know what to do so I'll move to another topic. This semester I am taking 00 hours of course work. I have six different classes and everybody thought life was going to be so hard for me, but it really has not been to bad. You have so much time to get everything done in college. Where in high school I was playing 0 different sports and taking hard classes, now I am just taking those hard classes. It is nice to be able to do whatever I want when want. I am used to having my parents around nagging me about homework and studying, but they can only call and do that here. Just because I am not feeling to swamped with 00 hours doesn't mean that I want to continue taking that many hours from here on out though. After this semester I only have to take like 00 hours a semester, which will be even better. That is unless I decide to study abroad. By writing about exactly what I have been thinking about, I can now see what has been wearing on me since I have been here. I mean I knew what the basis was for all I was thinking about, but until now I hadn't really thought about how all this stuff has such an effect on me. I have always and always will worry about my schoolwork and about girl problems, so that doesn't really come as much of a surprise to me. However it does surprise me that taking 00 hours doesn't really bother as much as I was thinking it was. 
__label__label0 What is love of an emotional basis? How do you know you are in love? Is there a boundary to love? Are there limits? Many people ask these questions, including myself, but cannot find an answer to these questions. I believe that this can only be found out by experience, where you test these limits and grow by it. I have noticed in my personal life that I grow emotionally and mentally each time I find a new partner. Love must be a learning experience right? It seems to be that way. I was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school, were I felt as if I was in love with this girl. We took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have. But this form of love seemed to build so quickly. As I looked back at the letters we wrote each other, it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two. How cold that be? Does love come at once, or does it grow on you? Nine months later, we ended our relationship. It seemed to be the most painful event I had experienced. I next felt like I loved a girl I barely knew. We dated, but nothing came of this, however the crummy feeling you feel after a relationship is over lasted almost a half year. How could someone I just dated for a span of a month create such an effect on me? By my senior year, sometime in January, I became interested in another girl. By this time I had felt that I had grew and I would be able to make this girl happy, and would not make he same mistakes I did with the last girls. As time passed my love grew for this girl, something I had not felt in so long and so strongly. Eventually (0 year and 0 month) things deteriorated. How could I have let this love slip? I thought I had mastered the relationship sector of my life. During the Summer I met a new girl, whom I am currently with. I don't want to make the same mistake I have before but is it inevitable. Will this relationship be like the others, or will I love her stronger than the other girl?  
__label__label1 I guess I have a life now, which is great for me. I always wanted one. Well, I did have a life before. I grew up in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I have 0 brothers and sister and along with PROPNAME, are all my best friends. Of course, there are things that I will not tell my brothers like when I have sex or whatever, but I will tell them that I kissed a guy. I tell PROPNAME everything. She is one of the closest people in my life. It is hard to be in LOCNAME and away from most of them. In LOCNAME LOCNAME I never worried about meeting other people because I had everything I needed in LOCNAME and my family. Now that I am in LOCNAME, it is hard to find friends. I am, though, and actually like the people I hang out with, even though I do not see them all of the time. I like going to live shows and now I have gone so much that I know people in bands and people that always go to see bands and it really is great. I do not really see them outside of this, but I am satisfied for now. There was this guy that I liked named PROPNAME who is the lead singer for a band. He is good looking and really is not my type at all. I did need a change. I needed to like someone who would make me feel ok and have fun and he was the perfect person to meet. I went to LOCNAME this summer. It was an experience and I went by myself which was great for me. I used to sometimes get lonely and hated to do things alone, but not anymore. I finally have proved to myself that I can take care of myself and that it is ok to be alone. Also, I learned that being alone and lonely are two separate things. I go to live shows by myself because I am pretty sure that I will see someone I know there. Would I still go if I knew that I would not know anyone? I do not know. I have not been put into that situation. Anyway, so when I came back to LOCNAME I discovered that PROPNAME had a girlfriend and at first I did not want to like her. But, I started talking to her and she is really nice and now I could not be happier for PROPNAME. I figure that if something is supposed to happen then it will happen and if it is not, then there is no need worrying about it. I think that PROPNAME and I had a little window of opportunity to get together before I left the country and it never happened and we missed our chance. I think fate can only do so much and that she gives us the opportunities and if we take it then great and if we do not then it was not meant to be. These windows of opportunities may come again, but they may not. There is no reason to wait for them to come because there are no certainties in life. I am happy that PROPNAME has such a great girlfriend. That is all I can do and just stay friends with him. PROPNAME does have this cute friend named PROPNAME who is also in a band. He is not the greatest band member, but BOY! Is he a looker. The first time I met kevin I had drank a lot and he was totally hitting on me. I did not take his advances because a)PROPNAME would not have wanted me to since I did not really know that guy b) nadia was coming home with me, and c) at the time I liked PROPNAME and wanted PROPNAME and not him. I saw him later on (after LOCNAME) and let me tell you, I kicked myself for not at least kissing him. He is SO GOOD LOOKING! Every girl that sees him on stage all say the same thing whether they have a boyfriend or not. About 0 week ago, we went to this party and he was going to give me a ride home so we got dropped off at his house and just made out. Man, I wanted that guy. We did not have sex, though, I cannot figure out why. I do not really know him and thought that since he was so good looking that he would be a little slut. I mean, I am sure that he was nice, but I was also sure that he was pretty experienced. So, when he was taking me home he talked to me and seemed pretty nice and I was shocked. It was a good shock, though. I saw him later on and I wanted to finished what we started and he took a rain check because it was late and he had to work extremely early the next day. One of his good friends told me great things about him and now I am interested. I do not want to start thinking that something serious is going to happen, but I cannot dismiss that it MAY. I just want to get to know him better and see if now is our window of opportunity. If it is not, then maybe I could get a good friend out of it. Either way, it is a win win situation. as long as he does not ignore me in the future. I do not think he is like that, but I guess I always think the best of people. We will see. 
__label__label1 That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span ORGNAME twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 000 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. ORGNAME has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the ORGNAME of ORGNAME Baseball ORGNAME. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the ORGNAME ORGNAME team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 What should I write for this assignment. If I write what I'm thinking at this moment a lot of people's feelings could be hurt and I really don't care to share these thoughts with a faculty that I know nothing about. My mother is approaching me, maybe she wants to talk with me. No, she stopped short at her purse. No, wait, she's coming over here. She asks me a question about my homework, something trivial. I don't think she can read my handwriting even though she's sitting right next to me and that's good because I wouldn't want here to read this piece of writing. Wait, she is reading it! I quickly lift up the pages to take them out of her line of sight. It's cold in this room, but it's only cold on one side. O course, it feels that way because I'm sitting beside a vent. It's so weird to sleep on the sofa, people can be replaced so easily! I've watched two people accomplish the task with much agility. Funny, I wish I could type fast enough to keep up with my thoughts, but they fly by too quickly. I wish this person in the room with me would ask me where I live, I think the answer would surprise her. What's the time, 00:00? I've gone over my time limit. How should I end this entry, would goodbye be appropriate? 
__label__label0 About two weeks before I came to Austin I was already feeling the affect ORGNAME college changing my life. Many of my friends left before I did and I said goodbye to all of them. I knew that it would be awhile before I saw any of them again. It feels really strange now that all the people that I have grown up with all my life are all going to new places. Many of the people from my high school I may never see again. Even though my high school was very large the faces I saw were familiar to me. Now that I am at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME many faces I have never come across before and that is a strange feeling. I kind of like having so many different people around. It just makes me feel better to know that I'm involved in such a large ORGNAME. Everyone that I do meet is very nice and I am making many new friends. My roommate and I are getting along very well and I am glad that I have him as a roommate. I have seen many people from my high school, but many of the upperclassmen I knew from my school live off campus so I might only run into them every once in awhile. It is strange that I don't have a "bestfriend" anymore because all of them are some other place. The people I hang with aren't as close to me as my old friends were. I guess that it has only been a couple of weeks so far and that is just how it will be until I live around here longer. I don't really wish that I had gone somewhere else, but I just get that home sick feeling a little. Home sick doesn't mean that I miss my parents so much, but just that all the people I was familiar with are gone. I don't really miss my parents that much yet, but I'm sure that I will soon when I finally realize that I'm not living there anymore and the LOCNAME is my home now. I wish that I had a car so that I could go places around here. I'm stuck on campus pretty much all the time. Almost everything that I need is here though so that is a good thing. I wish that I could have brought my turntables up to ORGNAME, but my parents didn't want me to yet. I hope that I can DJ at some clubs when I get a little more experience. My older friend was kind of my mentor to becoming a DJ and I'm hoping that he can give me the hook ups that I need to play at places. I don't like being alone in my room especially with the door shut it makes me feel closed off. If I'm here alone I will usually keep the door open so I can converse with the people outside. They have really good study rooms in the basement of my dorm and its really good to go down there and read or do homework. College so far has been pretty much what I expected it to be there hasn't been any real shockers yet. I only choose to come to UT my senior year. My parents both went to LOCNAME so I didn't really have a bias to any college. I visited A&M and UT as well as ORGNAME and some other colleges last year and that is when I made my decision to come here. I like the urban atmosphere that UT has as opposed to all the other colleges I visited. Since the time is up I better go down to the basement to study or else I won't make it into the Computer Science major. 
__label__label0 I am sitting at my roommate's desk typing on a computer which does not belong to me in a room that I am still getting used to. "Black Magic Woman" is playing on the radio. I like this song. It reminds me of my mom because she has the record from when she was a PROPNAME fan. The artwork on the cover of the album is really beautiful. There is a red winged creature on the cover and a lot of complex looking designs and a million different colors and stars and growing things. It looks like the night. Today in class I was about to fall asleep. I looked over at PROPNAME and she was practically dead. I don't think it was because the class wasn't interesting but because it was just the time of day when I feel really tired and I can't really think of anything. When I walk around I feel really relaxed, not at all anxious, and it's kind of pleasant. It reminds me of this boy that works nights, and he would hardly ever sleep and it was kind of nice to be around him because there wasn't a whole lot going on. we would just sit around listening to music or watching things. When he's not tired he talks a lot, and it kind of drives me crazy sometimes. He just talks about cars a lot and how things work and scientific stuff, and he's very passionate about those kind of things. I saw him on Monday and he told me he loved me, and it was so weird. I don't know where that is going. I've known him forever, and I think of him as a person that I can really trust and talk to things about. He reminds me of my father in some ways because my dad always talked a lot sometimes about things that didn't interest me very much but I liked him anyway. I liked how fat he was. It makes me laugh. He was a rather large man and he had really hairy arms like a bear. For some reason I think it's kind of funny to look back on this but maybe it's because I'm kind of tired although I shouldn't be because I've been getting plenty of sleep lately. I wake up in the mornings, and I have this feeling like I just can't wait to get out of the room and walk around, get some fresh air and get out of this little room which I have to share with another person and deal with all her stuff and everything. She's really nice though. I think I might have offended her yesterday because we were talking about Genesis, which we both have to read for our literature class, and I have a lot of questions about what it means and why it's so sacred and important and why God does all the weird stuff that he does in the book. I can't understand why he forbids people to eat the fruit or why he tells people to name their children certain things or why he appears and fights with PROPNAME. It's pretty messed up if you ask me. How am I supposed to believe in that stuff? It's nuts. I just want to be a good person like my mom. She always helps other people and thinks about others. When my dad was dying, she held everyone together and probably saved me along with everyone else. I don't think I would still be alive without my mom. She's really religious and perfect in most ways. I wish PROPNAME were here. He makes me feel better about things most of the time even though he weird me out at times. I wish I could go driving out in the country or even for a walk. I grew up on a farm, and I love open fields and fish and cows and crap like that. It's unfortunate because I can't imagine living anywhere else but in the country even though it is lonely at times. It is so peaceful and beautiful at night. One night PROPNAME and I stayed up all night and watched the sun rise. We were sitting on his truck. That was the night before I went to LOCNAME for 0 weeks to visit my best friend who lives there now. I love her so much. She was one of the few people that I ever thought was really like me. She was an incredible artist, and she inspired me to take up drawing and painting. My dad was an artist too. I have one drawing of his on my room at home. He liked to do cartoons and make corny jokes. He was so wonderful with people, and everyone loved him. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if he just walked into the room right now and how I would feel about seeing him after all this time. For I second I feel so excited, but then I realize that it could never happen. It is the most horrible feeling to know that you will never again see someone that you love so much, especially someone that you admired and tried to make yourself like them. 
__label__label1 Okay I guess I should begin this by mentioning a little bit about me I guess that's one thing we can I mean I can talk about. I was wondering when I was going to put a period in. That's one thing I'm bad at, I forget to put periods. I hate computers especially when they act up I mean I don't hate them it's just there so sensitive almost like people. People are sensitive to things like for instance today this guy I was talking to. I brought up why I had only seen him say hi to hispanics. Because I feel that you should be as friendly with every sort of people. However I know he's not a racist but I just wanted to bring that issue up to him to hear his response. This question was what my other friend said had made him mad. But hey I'm just frank like that I can't help it. I think now that I'm getting into the mode of things I'm starting to realize how my old self is coming out of me but I told myself that I was going to be me. Not to stop or halt to my small voices in my head. Actually its just one I don't want to give you all the idea that I'm schizo or anything. However I wanted what drugs can do to one. Is there any positive effects from psychedelic drugs? But I'm too afraid to find out that answer. That is something that I've noticed here in campus. It seems to be the main issue at hand but I also think that I just may surround or interact with people with a drug background. Like the book said you group yourself with people like yourself. That's so great about college, no matter who you are you'll find someone like you or for you. Right now I'm working on the female part of that companionship. I read somewhere that right now at this age one is in an endless tireless search for love even to the extreme of promiscuity. But I guess its pretty lame talking about my love life on this assignment but "hey" no one said I was confined to a set of topic. In fact, as I understood it. it's pretty much what we want to write about it. Is that not true, I think so. Notice how I'm burning time writing about nonsense. Or B. S. as some might call it. I'm really glad that I didn't procrastinate this to the last second. The scary thing is that I'm doing this assignment at about twelve thirty or so. In that vicinity. I guess. I guess my time is up. 
__label__label0 I really don't know what to say. I am just doing some assignment for the Psychology class. It is an interesting class, yes, and I am happy to be in it. I am now looking at my pencil. This pencil has been with me for about a year and I still have not lost it. I usually loose these pens and pencils within 0 or 0 weeks. My roommate just picked up the phone and started talking to a friend of mine. It seems that LOCNAME just won the football game. I am happy to hear that. Again I am thinking what am I going to write for this assignment. Yes, I can type pretty fast but to write for 00 minutes, I really don't know what I will be saying?! I am a junior by hours at ORGNAME but I am actually a sophomore in electrical engineering. I work as a grader for EE000 class and I really like doing the job. Only thing is, I hate failing students but what can I do? If I don't, they will fail the other chapters to come. My roommate is laughing right now and distracting my thoughts from this assignment! Oh, well! I hope my friend who is studying in the library does not call me right now while I am doing this work. My friend and I are supposed to go and eat at PROPNAME soon. I really hope he does not interrupt me. I am feeling hungry now and I am getting tired for typing for a long time even though only about 00 minutes have passed. I wish the food was better for me to eat at the cafeteria. Unfortunately, the food is not great. My friend just called me but I am continuing writing. I told him to call me back in 00 minutes. Hopefully, I will be finished with this assignment. I can hear the conversation between my roommate and one of my friends over the phone. They are talking about going to 0th street. I probably would like to go but I think I need to call my brother and sister today. Anyway, that is life and I need to do all this work. I am really tired and now, my thoughts just don't flow anymore. I hear the bathroom toilet flush in the community bathroom. The room is suddenly cold and I wish I wasn't wearing shorts. Oh well. now what. I wish work was just bla bla bla and a whole lot of rubbish. However, it is not that easy. I want to get this assignment done with. Why wasn't it 00 minutes instead of 00 minutes? I wonder what the results of this experiment are going to be? What are they going to help with? I am really hungry and the only thing that is stopping me is this work. Please finish, please finish. a door just slammed because someone closed it hard. I wonder why. anyway, I am tired now. I don't want to write a research report for Psychology but I also don't want the experimentation in psychology to take a lot of time for me. I think I will stick with the experiments. I love being a grader in EE000. People look up to me but I have to remember to be humble to them because they are also human beings who are just as intelligent as me and they are all good people. I wish I could see my parents, my brother and sister right now. Unfortunately, I can't since I am an international student. I wonder how my friends from high school are doing. I hope they are doing well. Oh well, I have to go. Is it time, yet? Let me check. phone rings. PROPNAME called my roommate. a cool guy. I have to do something right now. it seems both my roommate and PROPNAME went to the same party yesterday and had good fun. Come on finish up. yes it is done. Thank you. my hands are really tired. Bye and thank you 
__label__label0 I hate you. I hate how you have the power to hurt me. I hate how I called you wanting to merely tell you about "our" song being on tv and I got shot down. I hate how you called me some other girl's name thinking it was her that called. I hate how you can call some other girl and start to like her so soon after we broke up. You said that you had feelings for me merely 0 days ago and how can you forget about me so quickly? Was I just not that special to you that you could forget about me so soon? I hate you for not wanting to have a long distance relationship with me even though you're only like 0 hours away. I hate you for making me hurt so badly inside. I hate you for making me feel that horrible feeling you get in your chest when someone just breaks up with you. I hate you for having the power to invoke such emotion within me. I thought that you were different. I thought that you of all people wouldn't hurt me. You always told me to give you the benefit of the doubt and I finally learned to do that. You always said how you never wanted to hurt me and you never did until last night. Nothing you ever did was as painful as that. I just felt like someone had stabbed me and run over me a few times. I care so much about you still and I just don't understand you. You told me that you didn't want to have a girlfriend this first year at school, but then why in the hell are you calling a girl to get something started with her? How could you lie to me when I asked you who she was? You of all people never lied to me and never hurt me, but last night you ruined everything that I had made you out to be. I had you on a pedestal from all the other guys that I've been with and you proved me wrong. I wish you could feel all the hurt that I feel right now. I wish you could hurt so much that you don't know what to do about it. I wish you could take this hurt away from me because I don't deserve to feel this way. All I ever did was care about you and be good to you. I'm not sorry I still have feelings for you because you were just that special to me that it will take me awhile to get over you. I could never call some other guy and start talking to him so soon. It's so early and not fair to the other person. It took you forever to ask me out because you wanted to make sure you were over PROPNAME but what about PROPNAME? How can you talk to her so soon if I know you still have feelings for me? Am I just that easy to get over? I thought I was so much more than that. I'm not stupid, PROPNAME. I know you all too well. I know when you lie to me, but I guess I didn't know you too well because I never thought you could hurt me. I never thought you could be with another girl so soon after me. You told me not to start something with another guy to fill that void of you. Is that what you're doing because that's not fair. I just can't believe you. I wish there was something you could do to make me feel better, but I don't think there is. I don't even know how we can be friends anymore. I can't trust you even as a friend. I now know that you can lie to me. I wish it wasn't like this between you and me. I wish we could be together because things were so great with you that I didn't want to let it go. You were the best boyfriend I ever had but I don't know about that anymore. You ruined that whole perfect picture for me. I hate you for making me feel such sadness. How can you do that? 
__label__label1 Trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. When you ask someone "What do you want to eat?" most likely they will say, "I don't know what do you want?" Well, if I did know what I wanted to eat, I wouldn't have asked you. It is a simple question with a simple answer. Right now I just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, "I don't know whatever you want". Well, that's why I asked you, I don't know what I want to eat, that's why I asked you. I guess that I wanted him to make the decision for me. I honestly don't know what I want to eat. It's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but I'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. Does this mean that I'm lazy because I want someone else to make a decision that I can only make for myself. Maybe I'm not lazy; maybe it's just I want someone to help me make that decision. That seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm supposed to write down any and everything I am feeling or thinking right now. The truth is I am totally stressed out today and can't wait to finish this assignment so I can go home and relax and enjoy my wonderful weekend ahead. I have many things to be stressed out about right now. First of school, I'm trying to get my gpa up so I'm having to do just perfect in anything I do for my classes to get into the nursing school. This is my 0th year at ORGNAME and you would think I would have my life together by now. Although it's getting there, slowly but surely. To add to my stressful life is my exboyfriend of 0 years who just moved to LOCNAME so that he can "find himself". Whatever. But it's weird because I feel so much happier now that I am no longer with him. It's kind of like I'm a totally different person. I don't hang out with our usual crowd. It seems that I have changed for the better. Also adding some stress into my life is all my expensive bills I have to pay. Phone, electricity, rent, gas, food, beer, etc. One thing I am so grateful for is my wonderful family. I'm proud to say that my parents did a hell of a job raising my 00 year old sister, my 00 year old brother, and of course me the rookie 00 year old. I am so proud of them and their accomplishments. The reason I say this is because they had me, the first born, at a really young age (high school) and to see how well they are doing, unlike many others who start off on a bad foot. And then of course I have my wonderful grandparents who would do anything for any of their three grandchildren. Especially me since I was the firstborn hahaha! Well, I'm trying to think of what else I can tell you about myself in the remaining 00 minutes of this assignment. I will say that I do enjoy this class very much and want to acknowledge Prof. PROPNAME's excellent teaching skills. He makes the class so interesting you never want to miss his lectures. As a matter of fact, my exboyfriend to this class and he recommended I take it. Well, I have 0 minutes and I'm trying to think of what else I can inform you on about my wonderful life. Well, I'm from LOCNAME, LOCNAME. (pop. 00,000) My family still resides there. It's funny to see my little brother going to the same junior high I did with all the same teachers. And I can't believe my sister is a freshman also. I remember those days. I wish I could go back to when life was so simple. But no, now it's time to grow up and see what God has planned for me. I can't wait. I pray that each day he's by my side and helping me in any and every way possible. Guiding me to tomorrow. Well, I guess my time is up. I think in the past 00 minutes you guys at the psychology dept. can figure out a little about me by what I just wrote. Hopefully the data will be interesting. Thank you once again for your time. Hopefully I have written some interesting thoughts for you and I can't wait to see how my results turn out. Or do I even get to???? 
__label__label1 I am so glad I didn't go to work today, this gives me ample time to do this writing assignment Sleeping in is not always good but today it worked out perfectly I am so damn tired from working out yesterday I think my arms are going to fall to the floor today I wonder if that girl in the red sports bra knew I was checking her out I can't wait until this weekend I'm going out and someone is going to have to carry me in the dorm room I really miss my exgirlfriend back home I think I just need to find me a temporary just to have a little fun so I won't miss her so much Last night I got some really good sleep but not enough homework got done I really need to go to church this weekend I feel a sense of being lost when I don't I think it keeps me holy as well Mom is going to be real disappointed in me if I don't keep up the daily routine on Sundays I really wish God would have blessed me with the skill of being able to type faster so that I could jot down more thoughts in twenty minutes Damn it is 00:00 and I am so hungry Some Christians on Campus just stopped by and they have just made me put a ten minute gap in my thoughts because I had to sit and talk to them Maybe I'll got to one of their little functions sounds like a lot of fun to do Jester food has been real heavy on my stomach lately I hope it doesn't make me sick The other night I had a weird dream I dreamt that I pierced my own tongue I grabbed a long needle and stuck it through my tongue and stuck a barbell piercing through it It was so real that when I woke up I thought I really had my tongue pierced But I wasn't scared or worried that I had I was actually a little excited Which makes me wonder if maybe I should get my tongue pierced It's not really my style but I think the ladies might like it I am really mad that I haven't gotten a paycheck yet I am too broke to have any fun you just can't go to college without any money. The only thing that is keeping me afloat is the loan money I got for the semester. It's a lot of money but I want to save little What the hell am I supposed to do when I need to go to ORGNAME to get some Hotpockets or some bottled water The water here in LOCNAME is so nasty. That is definitely one thing that I miss about home is the good well water we had I was so good Twenty minutes has to be coming up soon. oh look, hey there all done, (a rush of happiness) and now I am thinking all of these unholy thoughts that I don't have to type Goodbye  
__label__label1 As I begin this assignment, I'm not sure what to say. I really never write my thoughts down. Maybe I should. I want to play halflife, but I can't. It seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do everything I want to. Maybe I should be better in my time management. But I think I'm pretty good as it is. I always try to plan out my day, making sure I have enough time for everything. Shoot, I can't believe I misplaced my bracelet, PROPNAME gave it to me. She's so sweet. There's a speck of dust on my calendar. I better pick it up and throw it away. I've made a pact with myself to learn how to type correctly on a keyboard. No cheating whatsoever. It is really weird. But I think I'll grasp it eventually. I was just thinking about my trumpet. I', not in any band here, but I still like playing my horn. I just wish I had the time for it. That really pisses me off. Hopefully, after I firmly get adjusted, I can figure something out. I was just thinking about PROPNAME, when I went to his place a couple of nights ago. He's such a funny son of a bitch. I had a good time. I wish his place had better lighting, though. its too dark. But I like the living room action. This dorm is very restrictive; I can't wait until I get an apartment. I'm sick of walking to a dining hall for food. And I really want to eat meals with meat in them. I got to finish my math work. Maybe I'll invite PROPNAME over again, PROPNAME's coming over after 0:00. I just have a couple of problems to work out, but then there is the new section. I probably should do most of that tonight so I can ask the TA some questions. That one guy got number 00. But he'll be there tomorrow, so that's cool. Man what's that other guy's name  yellow hat boy  Starts with a G, PROPNAME or something. I checked my answers with him this morning. Most of them were right, thank God. I just hope I can pull something good in this class. I'm determined to work hard. God willing, I won't end up like some of my friends. Man I'm tired. I always seem tired. I don't know why. Four more minutes. this backspace key next to the spacebar is so convenient. I don't have to pick my hand up whenever I make a mistake. That just goes to show how lazy I am. Mofo action lazy. I got a reply from PROPNAME today, I was so glad, I miss him, I miss a lot of people. I guess it's going to take me a while to find people like those I left behind in high school. They were so good in so many ways. There's music playing. oh well, time's up. 
__label__label1 I love just being me. Honestly without my personality, I am nothing in this world. There are so many people alive today that without my individuality, I could not survive. It would be too weird if I walked around the streets seeing a splitting image of myself. Hehe I think that I would probably pass out if that ever happened to me. Ouch, my arm really itches right now. Man I hate when I scratch so hard and it leaves marks on my skin. It's so unattractive and it is so annoying when I have to shave over it. I really can't believe that he would say that to her. Doesn't he realize that some things are best left unsaid especially when you don't know the whole story? Fainting has to be one of the most unique experiences that I have ever gone through. It's so weird that you lose all control of yourself for that onesecond. Thank goodness that girl was there to help me even though she didn't know me. I would freak out if I ever came in contact with someone who was about to pass out and fell on me. Man PROPNAME really can draw. I wish that I had the talent to do something like drawing my selfportrait. My legs are really starting to bother me since they are in that position. Oh man I need to go read my Theater since I have that class tomorrow. What should I wear tomorrow? I wonder if it is going to be as hot as it has been this whole time. I thought it would feel so much better than LOCNAME. For goodness sakes, at least ORGNAME has wind. Man what I would give to be at the beach right now without a care in the world sipping on the best tasting glass of lemonade and laying out getting the greatest tan in the world. And the POboys at ORGNAME's. No one makes greater Fantail Special than they do. I really hope my computer comes soon. I can't wait to start adding songs to my computer. Why hasn't my phone rang in a while? I need to call PROPNAME in a minute. I wonder if I have anything that I need to get done tomorrow. Hopefully my backpack will work out good. Because it was so cheap compared to everything else that was there. I love my shoes and I can't believe that my black ones broke. That was too weird that it happened especially since it was in the middle of the street and I wasn't doing anything that would have made it break normally. I hope my computer is the one I wanted. I wonder who is calling right now? Must be for Amber since she is talking to that person right now. I really feel like watching Hope Floats right now. That is such a great movie, and the guy in it is so hot. 
__label__label0 My chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. I find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. I have come to the realization that Indian producer people truly are strange. This realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. I mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. The people upstairs just made another random noise. It sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. I'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since I don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. I really don't know what they do upstairs. The people next door to us are just as strange. They screen their phone calls I think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. But then I hear them in their room. Actually, I'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. We've gotten some random phone calls. Some of these calls came from people I know very well and yet I can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. I just realized that I have very random thoughts; I think that this means that I'm not really focused on what I'm doing or something. Actually, I'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. I just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. That is quite sad; generally I always have something that I can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. Yet when I'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. I wonder when I'm going to get rid of my cough. I refuse to take cough syrup because I don't like the taste of it, and so I'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. I don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. Then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. That would most definitely not be a good thing. I guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. At least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. Grape is a good flavor. Chocolate is a good flavor too. I like chocolate. Actually I like all sugar; I think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar I intake daily is what causes my oddness. But sugar is good nevertheless. So is chocolate. I don't think it causes acne. How can something that tastes so good be so bad? Of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, Italian food, etc). Ah well. I never knew twenty minutes could last so long. It's neverending. I feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. There was just another random thud from the people next door. I think they must have dropped something plastic. I just realized that I don't really know any of the people who live around me. I think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. That's kind of sad, considering I hear from everyone that "People who live on the same floor as you become your family" and I don't really seem to sense that. We all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. That, to be honest, is the one thing I didn't like about UT. The fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. Even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. We all have our high school buddies. Well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. If I had counted the number of times I hit the backspace button during this exercise, I think I would come up with this huge number. I never knew I'm so bad at typing; I have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet. 
__label__label1 Today has been pretty easy. That girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least I am out of there. For once, I actually do not have a headache yet. And it's already almost noon. I wish I didn't have to go to work today. It's not that I don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. Most of the people are nice. I wish I didn't have to stand up all the time, though. My back itches. It is really hot in my room. Lately, it has been freezing in here. It is probably because I am sitting right by the window. This assignment is really making me tired. However, I actually got almost 0 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. Maybe that is why I don't have a headache yet. Tonight, though, I need to go to the gym and work out. I have only worked out once since I've been here. I think I am getting out of shape, even though I seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. Oh well, it's not like I'm overweight or anything. I am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. It used to make me sick for the first few days I was here. My neck itches now. I think it is moving! Oh my goodness I can't wait until this weekend. I finally get to go home and eat some normal food. Most of all, I get to see PROPNAME. I miss him so much. I'm not really lonely all the time without him, but I am never really happy like I used to be. But after I see him for a few days and have to leave him again, I am sure I'll be pretty lonely. It makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. Now my head itches. My back hurts. I haven't had a massage since I've been here. That would be so nice. Anyways, I just ate a nasty lunch and I feel kind of nauseous. Yuck. Dinner tonight is Mexican food and I think I'll walk to the union to eat. I am really tired now. This type of writing seems to put me into a trance. I feel like I need to take a nap now. I don't think that is possible though, since I have to be at work in about 00 minutes. At least that is the last thing I have to do today. I don't think I even have any homework. Maybe I'll take a nap after work. Well, actually, I need to call PROPNAME after work. Maybe I'll take a nap after that. The room seems like it has cooled off a lot. Maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. My neck and back are so stiff. I want to lay down so bad but I know that if I do, I'll probably fall asleep. My roommate slept in this morning. That was a good idea. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. This weekend should be so much fun. I get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. I haven't seen my parents in 0 weeks. I know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. I need to email her. I need to email PROPNAME too. I wonder what PROPNAME is up to. Maybe I should call him. I don't think I will because he is probably in class and I really don't want to talk to his roommate. Speaking of roommates, I need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. I have no idea what she is talking about. Oh well. My twenty minutes in finally over. I think I will go lay down. 
__label__label0 It may be tough to come up with an abundance ORGNAME ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed LOCNAME for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at ORGNAME ORGNAME with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. 
__label__label1 As I sit in this room, in this computer lab, I hear all the different sounds around me. The computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. I also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as I type. I've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. My eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, I would love to take a nap. This day was pretty long. I hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. I'm feeling so tired! I would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. I don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. I know when I go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but I ate way too much today and I am not in the least bit hungry. Not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. I wish I was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. I hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. It would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. Seeing him makes me miss him more but I guess I should enjoy our time together. I wish he went to this school or at least lived in LOCNAME then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. He seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. I don't believe him when he says that. I wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. I am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. I hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? I wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. I think I'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because I'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. I do love him though. It'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. Tonight is Thursday night. This is a good night because I have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. I should have done this assignment earlier but of course I always wait for the last minute. But technically this isn't the last minute because its not Friday yet, and it is early evening. Tonight I want to do nothing but relax! I hope I can get together with my friends since I don't see much of them anymore. I wish I lived at Jester at times like this. I thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. I have this sweatshirt on but I don't feel like taking it off. How many more minutes until my time is up? I've typed quite a bit of information thus far. Pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. I wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that I type fast and I can type basically every thing that I am thinking. This computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. I hear music and I'm wondering where it is coming from. I figure since tonight is the Mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. They should have a Honduran culture night. Haha. Why is the computer across from me making so much noise? Wow. I sure do ask my self a lot of questions. Well, I think my time is almost up. I guess I have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. I am so terrible at mental math. What happened? I have 0 minutes left I guess. How terrible I am at mental math! I am glad that I don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. My grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and I've been too lazy to go to the office hours. But I did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. Why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. I walked all that way to Jester for nothing. I'm sure if I got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. Why am I assuming that I will get a bad grade? Maybe I won't. The TA seems pretty easy going and she knows that I am interested in keeping/getting a good grade for that class. I. am glad the movie station is back on. I'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. Sleep. I want to sleep! I wish I wasn't always so tired. Yes! I only have a few more minutes left. I'd say about 0 minutes left. Finally! This is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in Times new roman font. I didn't know I had that much stuff running through my head. Actually, it doesn't surprise me. I always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and I can't think straight. I think that's why I interrupt people so much when I'm talking. because I have so much stuff in my mind that if I don't say it I'll forget it. I guess that shouldn't matter since I'll have another 00 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. But anyways. My time is up. How great! 
__label__label0 I cannot believe that I have only been back home for a couple of days and already I want to go back to UT. I guess in a weird way I consider UT my home now. It is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. I am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. I see things differently now than I used to and am starting to wonder if I even want what I used to. I want to go into journalism, but ever since I got to UT everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. I am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that I would love even more? I am only eighteen, I could not possible know right now what I want to do with the rest of my life. I have a good idea, but I cannot know for sure. Yet everyone expects me to know what I want. I do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. Personally, I just love the process of learning interesting things. I have been waiting forever to go to college just so I could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. Every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. In my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. It was a typical high school. Academics were mediocre, but football was God. The athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. Athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. Some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. In a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. I do not really think I learned much in high school. I learned more in three weeks in LOCNAME than I did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. I had all these romantics notions of LOCNAME and LOCNAME, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. I really want to go back there sometime. LOCNAME was so gorgeous, and I thought I would hate it. In the end, it was one of the best places we visited. Most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but I think it prepared me a lot for college. I had to interact with a lot of people that I did not know really well. I also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the Jester Dorms. Who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! It is kind of weird being in a dorm. Instead of having to drive to see my friends, I could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. We are practically living together. I just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. It just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. We either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. Unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. Two of my good friends are coming to school here. It really is a good thing too because I am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. I can talk and talk once you get me going, but I'm not really good at those first meetings. Things always seem too awkward to me. Then I just feel uncomfortable. I think that is why I usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. It is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. In time though, I should be able to relax and deal with all these things. I hope, anyway. 
__label__label0 I feel that I am not very satisfied with school right now. I don't have that many friends but I am sure that I'll start making some soon. I miss my home and my miss my family and I miss my girlfriend who is also in fort worth. I always talk to her and I wish she was here all the time. I miss her a lot and all I can think about is being able to talk to her. school seems a little hard. I haven't gotten used to the studying habits yet. I know that I will soon get back into the grove though. I can't wait until I get to go home this weekend. I want to go home every weekend but I know I can't. it is so hot out side and I want things to cool down just a little bit. I want to be able to go out and play but I don't like going to parties and that's all people want to go do. so it seems like there isn't ever anything to do down here unless you go to a party. all I want to do is go home. it is a lot more fun at home. I don't understand why people say college is so fun when I haven't really had any fun yet. I don't want to join any frats because I don't think they're worth it. and I also hear that they make enemies also. and I don't want to make any enemies down here. my classes are kind of confusing. and since I don't know any body in the classes, I don't feel comfortable asking the people next to me questions. the weeks go by so slow. the only thing that I like about school so far is that I get done with school on Friday at eleven o'clock. that way I can leave for fort worth much sooner. my arms are starting to hurt and I still have just gotten started. time is going by so slow. I want to get out of my supplement housing. I don't like having a room with three other guys. and I don't like my room not having a sink or a mirror. I sort of like the big classes though. it makes class seem more fun. I am so sleepy right now. I don't know if I want to do my home work any more. I might just want to go home and take a nap. my room is so cold. we tried to get the a/c turned down but it still blows super cold air. and plus I sleep on the top bunk right by the a/c vents so it blows right on me. I always get a really cold nose in the middle of the night. and I also have a room mate with a really loud alarm. his alarm constantly goes off and he keeps hitting the snooze button. so every nine minutes it goes off again and again and again. it's so annoying. it's like just freaking wake up or turn off your alarm. I don't understand these people. and would be trying to sleep and then he walks into the room and turns on the lights which light up the whole room. and I'm trying to sleep. he has a little lamp but he doesn't use that instead. talk about no consideration. I don't like having to go down the hall to the bathroom just to brush my teeth. or going down to the bathroom just to put some lotion on my face. I want to be able to just wake up and do all that in front of a sink and a mirror that I don't have and what every body else does. I am getting tired of writing and I'm glad that the twenty minutes is almost up. I wonder if you guys are really going to be reading this thing all the way through. I wonder if you think I'm weird for saying some things that I have said. I wonder if I'm the only person that feels this way. last time I played basketball and now I am very sore. it's hard for me to walk around. I think I'm about to fall asleep on the computer. I can barely keep my eyes open. well sorry guy but my twenty minutes just about to up. bye bye and I hope y'all have a good day. 
__label__label0 Here I am at ORGNAME with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They are both doing their homework and studying. All I've done since I got here is waste my time and distract my friends from doing their work. I should be doing my reading for tomorrow, but I keep procrastinating, so I decided to finish my assignment for Psychology instead. There is so much reading to do in college. It's kind of over whelming, but I guess it's all about time management. I can't wait until the weekend. Not for any particular reason, just because the weekend is the best and most relaxing part of the week. Oh, and also, I'm going back to LOCNAME this weekend with my brother. It's my mom's birthday. What should I get her for her birthday? I asked her and she keeps telling me not to get her anything for her birthday, but I'm pretty sure that translates into "get me something good. " Actually, that would be me. Mom's not really like that. Maybe I really shouldn't get her anything. I don't know, I don't think she's going to have a very happy birthday though. Especially after the news she heard about our cousins. What is wrong with my uncle? Why is he abandoning his family like that? I think my aunt might have asked my mom for money. Oh well, I guess my parents will figure something out. I wonder where my friends went? They just disappeared. I guess they both left while I was writing this thing and now I'm left all alone. Maybe I should eat some of those Goldfish. No, I cannot. I vow not to gain the "freshman fifteen". I'm tired. I wonder if I'm even doing this assignment right. I hope so. I really want to do well this semester. Yea! 0. 0! Well, we'll see. Psychology's such a big class though. I wonder if they're going to go through and read each one of these. Probably not. Actually, I think the professor was saying that they weren't going to. So I could just write a whole bunch of nonsense and I guess they wouldn't even notice. My sociology professor cusses a lot. I don't really mind, but every time he does it, I'm kind of taken aback. Sociology's actually really interesting. More interesting than I thought it would be. Maybe I should be a sociology major. Maybe not. I need to hurry and declare my major. I feel so lost as a Liberal Arts undecided student. Actually you know what though? All my classes are kind of similar. Maybe it's because they're all sciences but they're all talking about scientific method and random sampling. Maybe that's because it's the beginning. My friend came back. She took a long time. I want to talk to her and ask her where she went, but I can't until I finish recording my thoughts for psychology. My gum is getting really nasty, all soft and about to dissolve. I feel like my teeth are rotting. I should really stop chewing gum. I feel like my jaws are expanding. I heard that somewhere, that if you chew a lot of gum, your jaws will expand. Where did I hear that? Oh well, time's up. I hope I did the assignment right. 
__label__label0 A fire alarm sounded right before I was going to start this assignment. I had to walk down thirteen flights of stairs. When I got outside we had to walk across the street and stand there waiting for the magical voice to tell us that we can come back inside. Naturally, I had to walk up up up up thirteen flights of stairs. At least I know how to exit if there is a real fire. It also has given me something to write about. I bet that there going to do this crap a couple times each semester. Safety is a good thing. Terrible disasters that can be eliminated with a little planning kill a lot of people. I read that somebody said " a person that will trade freedom for security deserves neither. " I think that it was PROPNAME PROPNAME who said that. I don't liberals because they are not in the business of creating a more free society. They just want to create more of a bureaucracy to ensure more safety. Gun laws are a good example. They think that if guns are illegal, that crime will go down. It sounds like a good idea to a lot of politically correct or pussified people. The real effect from that terrible idea would be less good people with guns and the same number of bad people with guns. The good people can't protect themselves in their own homes from the bad people that can easily get guns. PROPNAME, the constitution guarantees us our right to have guns, probably the only reason why we are still aloud to have them. LOCNAME just passed laws that have allowed the government to confiscate all of its citizens' guns. That would be a nightmare that would not stand for. Sometimes I think stuff this will happen. Other freedoms that people had a hundred years ago, are gone today. My grandchildren and other ancestors might not even live by the same constitution that we live by today in this country. I really want to graduate school so that I can afford to have a lot of kids and still be able to put them through college. I'm the last PROPNAME in my family so I hope my sperm will create a couple of boys with my wife. I wish that sex were not such a strong desire. It kind of gets in the way of being productive. The TVs and ads and the radio just pour on the sex appeal tactic because they know it's such a strong desire and emotion. I saw a cute girl when we had that fire drill. I think she was looking at me too. I should have said something to her. I wish I had more confidence to talk to girls. I wish I could stay drunk or high without the setbacks of puking and slurring words and possibly smelling funny. It's so easy to talk to girls when I'm inebriated. 
__label__label1 I don't like IceBreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. I won a huge pack of IceBreaker's gum from Pro Grad and I now feel obligated to make use of it even though I dislike it. I do that a lot. I eat foods that I don't really like just to make my mom happy. It is not really a big deal. I usually tell people what I like and what I dislike, but sometimes I don't. My grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and I don't like coconut, but I use to eat it anyway. One day I just stopped and she didn't really notice. I was like, "Man I could have stopped a long time ago, but instead I didn't. " Okay that makes no sense, but I do not always make sense. My mind jumps from thing to thing, and I digress a lot. I get off track often. Love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. To me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. I cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. I can get deep and all emotional when I feel the moment calls for it, but right now I am just not really in a "deep" mood. I still have to read my Chemistry and read my Cyberreader for my Cyberpunk class. Why am I taking a Cyberpunk class? I have no idea. I like to try and experience new things so I decided to take it. Actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. Ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. I love to be happy. I hate to be sick. I love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when I am sick. The water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. I don't want to do my reading assignments. I want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. I want to go see "The Cell" with PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I can be such a teenager sometimes. I do some of the most immature and silly things. I can fall all over myself when I see a cute boy band, and I can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. PROPNAME PROPNAME, a country singer, has a song called "Ordinary People". It is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. It talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. The great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. I can't imagine being photographed all the time. I don't look good in photos when I am posing, so you can only imagine how awful I would look in ones where I do not pose. I sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. You all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that I have selfconfidence issues. I can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. I like being short. I like that people view me as cute just because I am short. Being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. I just like the idea of the guy being tall. My boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because I look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason I think that makes us look cuter. Why do they call the prestage room the green room? The green room is often not even green. I don't understand that. I don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. Except of course for in way west LOCNAME where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. I hate people who are hypocrites. I think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. I wish I was smarter. I wish I could sing. that would be a great talent just because I like to sing. Two minutes to go! I can't help but look at the clock. I am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages I have to read. I am very impatient, but I am patient when I feel it is necessary. Times Out! The End! 
__label__label0 I am about to go to my first sorority date dash with my boyfriend. It is at LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. We are going to drive race cars and play video games. The tv has a show on about a man that slit a nine year old's throat from ear to ear. I think that is disgusting. I can't believe our society has people like this. I am very excited about my date dash. However, I have been feeling very overwhelmed with school lately. There is so much reading in every class. I don't feel like I am ever going to get caught up. College is so hard. Tomorrow I need to go get a new backpack and shirt at the Coop. I am excited about the football game on Saturday. This is my first college football game. I think it is going to be very hot and miserable. I will probably complain a lot and want to leave at half time. My friends say that they aren't going to let me leave early. It should be interesting. I also have to go straight to work after the game is over. I am going to do a lot of homework on Sunday. Hopefully I will get a little more caught up. I feel very stressed about school. This week is better than last and hopefully next week will be better than this one. I know it is going to get better. The guy on tv is a psycho. He is now saying that God told him to sacrifice the boy. He thinks he did the right thing. That is ridiculous along with the insanity plea. It makes me sick that people can do these horrible crimes and then plead insanity. This guy is not insane he is just a sicko and I think he deserves the death penalty. Tomorrow I have to go to class from 0:0000:00 and then I'm going to take a huge nap. I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. I guess I will just get used to less sleep. This college thing pretty much sucks. Sometimes I wish I would have taken the easy way out and gone to the local community college. However, I am getting a much better education here at LOCNAME. I live at home and commute everyday. This is really stressful because I have to leave my house at least one hour before class actually starts. I am about to go out now and I think this was a very interesting assignment. I am probably going to be late to the house where we are supposed to meet. 
__label__label1 As the past couple of weeks have flown by, I have been stressed about my work load. Like probably most college students I have the urge to wait for the last minute before starting any assignments. So far and usually I am always able to get my work done on time, however if I would only start the assignments a little earlier I would not have as much stress as I do now. Also after recently reading the first chapter of my psychology book I am wondering if the cause of my illness is to due to excessive stress. On Tuesday I started to have a runny nose which later progressed into a sore throat. I usually do not fall victim to illness very easily so I am almost sure that stress is playing a large part in it. At my house in LOCNAME I had gotten use to having my friends and family all within a five minute drive. Now that I have moved to LOCNAME and been separated from home for an extended period of time, I occasionally find it hard to balance my time. With the options of sleep, tv, eating, homework, video games, or just hanging out with my friends, it is hard to make a decision on both what I want to do and what I need to do. On the up side of things I feel like I am slowly becoming accustomed to my new life here in LOCNAME. I have started to develop a study pattern and my urge and will to do work on time and efficiently has increased. Over the fall and spring semester my ultimate goal is to have a high enough grade point average to transfer into the business school. If that transfer is successful it will only give me more motivation to try harder and be a better student. That is certainly the goal of me being a college student to begin with. I am looking forward to continuing my hard work and hope to enjoy the benefits at the end of the year. 
__label__label1 I really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at LOCNAME, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. PROPNAME seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. I guess I will go for a little while, not too long because I have a class at 000 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. Why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? I don't freaking get it. It's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. WHY? Are the powers that be trying to torture me? Well, whatever happens, I will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. I just thought about something, I am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to LOCNAME for Labor Day to visit my auntie PROPNAME, and my Uncle PROPNAME. I wonder how Precious is doing. I hope she still isn't messing with that idiot PROPNAME, like I think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. I mean, I know that I have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but I learned my lesson. I want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when I need it. Is that too much to ask for? Gee, I can go on and on about men, and the experience s that I have had with them, but that is old and I am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that I can be on the dean's list like I want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and I hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that I do this year and my years to come. I know that I am capable of doing it all, but I just want to survive. This city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!  
__label__label0 I don't feel like going to class today, but because I paid a great amount of money for this education I might as well. But wait, it's a discussion class for Calculus, oh well, it's not like I understood anything what Dr. PROPNAME was saying yesterday in class. Do I really have to walk all the way over there? If I don't go, I can spend some of that time studying for a chemistry test tomorrow, as well as download some more songs off the Internet. The chemistry test is my first test and I don't how Dr. PROPNAME makes her tests. But because it's over the first two chapters, which were basically a review of chemistry in ORGNAME ORGNAME, hopefully, it might be easy. I sure hope so! Ahhh. school, it's getting on my nerves. Let this week calm down, it'll be okay next week. I can't wait until the weekend. On my gosh, I have 00 minutes until my next class, what should I do? Sleep, nahh. what if I oversleep, that would be bad. I guess I should start packing my books and looking for my keys to lock the room, which by the way, I really don't understand why the lock on the door opens when you turn the key to the left, and locks when you turn the key to the right. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Oh well, why am I making such a big deal about it, it provides me the security of my place. I should be thankful. Anyhow, I need to get to class. 
__label__label0 My mind is wandering back and forth between what I want to do and what I need to do. I need to study, read about a dozen chapters out ORGNAME my textbooks and learn the material inside and out, but I don't want to. I want to just remain calm and lie down on my bed with no worries and no setting of the alarm clock. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I'm actually in a rather uncomfortable state of mind right now, or in reality, I've been in that state of mind since the first day of school. It seems I have lost a lot of my drive and motivation, but I'm trying to gain it back. I want it BACK! Anyway, I am somewhat depressed and sad and I just feel uneasy. I want to be able to give my emotions freely, love in particular, but something always holds me back. Maybe I'm scared, I don't know. What am I going to do with my life? Now that's a question which really needs an answer, but do I have oneno, not me! I am currently a biology major, but I don't know if that is what I want to do. I don't want to go to medical school, but I don't know what else would be really interesting for me. I am very scared that I'm not going to find out what I want to be or should be and then I'm just going to be stuck. Competition is awful, especially between siblings. My brother knows what he wants to do, and I am 000% certain that he will be successful, in fact I know that he would be great at anything he decided to do. That's what I wantI want to know that I'm going to make it without a doubt or hesitation. This is the lack of motivation, inspiration, confidence, or whatever, I was referring to earlier. I use to be very strongwilled and I always set my mind to something and did it. Now, I know I still do that to a certain degree, but not as much, I WANT IT BACKNOW! I'm lonely and tired. I want to find some really good people who I can become really good friends with, but for some reason, I'm really not looking that hard. My social skills have also decided to go into hibernation for a while. Consequently, its my first year at ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME, surrounded by 00,000 people, and I don't even go out of my way to meet new people. That is something that is really starting to bother me, but hopefully as I get more familiar and comfortable with the system and environment everything will end up working out by itself. See normally, my thought would be that I would change and rise to the challenge because that's me, but not now, now I am depending on a nonexistent entity to "work out by itself. " Oh well, something needs to change. 
__label__label1 You know, being in a relationship is great. And I absolutely LOVE College. But I have discovered that it is REALLY hard to put the two of them together. I mean, PROPNAME and I have been together for about 0 ¸ monthssmall on the grand scale of things, I know, but it seems like an eternity. In fact, I find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before PROPNAME. He is, after all, my first real serious relationship. And I don't know. I mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn HARD to keep what we have in college. I love him. I mean really love him. He says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. I think that if you're in love, then you KNOW. So that means that he probably doesn't love me. We're lopsided. So that kind of sucks, but I deal with it, you know? I mean, sometimes it gets me down because when I say, "I love you" I don't hear one back. So, I get depressed. But he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and I guess that's enough to suffice. Maybe sometimes I feel like I just have enough love for the two of us, but other times I become really doubting. Maybe I don't love him either. I mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? How do we know that love even really exists? How do we know? I mean, yeah, there are songs, books, and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity. But how do I know that it's not just a really big "like. "? I mean, maybe that's all I have for PROPNAME really big like. That makes me think. Because, if it is just a really big like, then where did all of this "love" stuff come from? Do I say that I love him because it's my first real relationship and I just don't really know any better? Am I really just enamored with him because he was my first? Is the fact that I'm questioning it at all mean that it isn't real love? Don't they say that if you have to question love, then it isn't really love? I mean, I know that I would do anything for this boy. And I mean anything. I know that I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to be with him, to see him, to touch him, to smell him, to make him smile, to make him laugh, to hear his voice. I know that when I'm not with him, I am wondering where he is or what he's doing or wondering if he's wondering about me. But, it's like deep down, I know that he's not. He doesn't feel about me the way that I feel about him. And because he says that he likes me a lot, and he's not sure if it's love or not. since I like him more, that makes me think that what I feel must be love because it's on a higher level than that of which he feels. Logical, right? I didn't think so either. I guess I'm just confused. Most guys aren't as confusing as PROPNAME. Actually, for the most part, he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy. But he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him. I mean, I'm always wondering "ok, he says he's fine. but does that mean that he's really ok, or does that mean that he's still upset but doesn't want to tell me?" I mean I secondguess myself all of the time with him. I have a really low selfesteem when I'm around guys. I'm tall, so I always think that guys don't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter, cuter girl. I mean, PROPNAME is in a frat and he doesn't want me to go to parties with him. That REALLY hurts my feelings. I feel like it's because of a lot of reasons, but the main one being that I'm not pretty enough for him to "show me" to his brothers or whatever. Also, because he wants to not be attached to anyone at a party so that he can hook up with other girls for one night standssomething that he tells me he's done before. That really bothers me. He tells me that he's cheated on all of his girlfriends beforeso how do I know that he's not going to cheat on me, too? What assurances do I have???? How can I trust him? Especially when I know that he's done it before? How do I know he won't do it again? PROPNAME tells me "once a cheater, always a cheater. " Is she right? Should I not trust him? Do I have a choice?  
__label__label0 Right now I fell very discouraged about all this college business. Everything is going wrong. My computer keeps screwing up and I don't know how the hell to fix it. I want to go home where I know where things are. I wouldn't have a computer problem if I were home. I have barely any friends here and nothing ever to do but to watch TV even though there is never anything good on. I miss my girlfriend, I wish I was home. I'm sick, my throat hurts, I feel trapped, I have too much crap to know what to do with and there's no room for it. I hate college right now. I don't see why people like it or why they keep going. I think I made a mistake by coming here, nothing is going right. I can't even eat when I want, I have to wait until a certain time or walk 0 miles. I'm tired and need to study but really don't want to. Why am I the one who is always getting screwed over? I want to throw my brand new 0000 dollar computer out the window because it's a piece of crap. I'm not even sure I should be at college. I'm incredibly stupid, I don't see how I got accepted here. I have the worst memory in the world which should help me out a whole lot here. I'm hungry but oops, there's nowhere to get food. I feel like crying all day for so many reasons. I wish I could be happy like everyone else. I'm tired and am going to bed. 
__label__label0 So here are twenty minutes of PROPNAME's thoughts. As I sit hereORGNAME I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I'm agnostic ORGNAME proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept PROPNAME PROPNAME will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has "faith" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. I've never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it's there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I'm dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I'm gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in LOCNAME) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to "recruit. " At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have PROPNAME PROPNAME in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of ORGNAME and ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will "choose" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per PROPNAME PROPNAME that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from PROPNAME's ultraliberal mind. 
__label__label1 Well, today was a bad day. Not bad in the sense that negative things happened, it just wasn't good. I talked to PROPNAME, the girl I really like, and it turns out she doesn't feel the same way. Earlier in the week (I hope PROPNAME isn't reading this) I had another girl come out and tell me she had feelings for me. I hope PROPNAME doesn't view me as I view the girl. She is nice, but I feel awkward. I don't know how to act or respond sometimes. Am I sending the wrong signal? Am I communicating poorly? Who knows? Certainly not me. So, that's that. PROPNAME Still really likes me as a friend, but nothing more. Kind of sucks. I wish I were more attractive. I think I got the bases covered on personality, just the physical appeal that is holding me back. I'm working at it. I am enrolled in intermediate racquetball and playing whenever I can. I'm up to two pullups. This is a big accomplishment. This summer, I started working out with my best Friend PROPNAME and then I could do any. Now two. I so excited. PROPNAME goes to ORGNAME. He was supposed to come here, with me, but decided that "pep" and "spirit" was his thing. I'm cool with that I guess, I just wish I wasn't stuck with the "potluck". Will, my roommate is all right and all, I just wish I could open up a little more than I do. He doesn't "get me" like another one of my good friends would. My best friend from high school, PROPNAME PROPNAME, will be coming up this weekend. I can't wait. I miss just hanging out with the crew. I like college and all, and I'm making the transition fine, I just miss the good ole days. I am coming to terms so much better than some I know. PROPNAME, the one who came forward to me about her feelings, is having a really ruff time. Apparently, whenever she tries to talk to her mom about it they get in a fight. So instead, the just avoids confrontation all together. Not a very wise approach if you ask me; and she did, and I told her. I like meeting new people. PROPNAME apparently doesn't. It's out of her comfort zone. Actually, that's how I met PROPNAME. She's so awesome. She into anime just like me, she draws, she's tall, and she just all around cool. Sadly, she does not share this sentiment to the extent of which I put forth. She thinks I'm hilarious and a great guy to hang out with, but she just doesn't like me like that. I should go on, get over her and whatnot. I cant. I've tried. I like her way too much. I will eventually though, or that is what I've been told by the ones I open up to here besides PROPNAME. PROPNAME is a great friend. She thought that I liked her at first, but then I started opening up to her about PROPNAME and she understood. She rooms with PROPNAME, whom I met at orientation. She had a thing for me too. I don't know, when I like them, I get turned down and away, but when I just think they are cool, I get asked out. Why can't things go my? Be different, somehow? This can't be fair. I try so hard to get what I want. It never just comes to me. Like now, in engineering, I have decided that I don't like engineering, but I'm stuck there for at least the semester. I enjoy PSY000 with PROPNAME. He's a character and the subject matter interests me. I would consider psych as a major, but that is my brothers field and I'm already too into his shadow. Oh well. We will see how things turn out. They usually do. For the better, or worse. what's the difference? I don't know. Could I even tell? If I follow that principle things would turn out regardless. good, or bad. Who cares? Well, I do. The future is uncertain and that is why it's scary. Whether or not this is actually read or just run through an analyzer, it has been a good place to vent. I look forward to the next installment in this tedious tale of love, trust, faith, and social bearings. Until the next time. =) 
__label__label0 Its hard to think about what to write of when you are told to, although maybe its hard because things have become more difficult as of late. It must be the typical freshman story but even though we all try to be so different when we come here we all end up in the same boat. It so much like high school its hard to believe, we'll the social part of it is anyway. Sometimes I wonder what I would do if there weren't music in the world. At times it seems to be the only thing that keeps people together, although you never hear many people talk about it in that light. What is even more interesting is how depressing and sentimental most of these essays will be. I wonder how many people will write about how depressed they are and how no one really knows the real them and how hard it is to wake up in the morning. Its hard to differentiate between what is real and what is a line out of a movie that someone is saying these days. So maybe that's why everyone tries to be different. I really don't know. But as everyday passes it seems like people lose a sense of the beauty in the world. There isn't anything much more beautiful to me than the sunset or just sitting outside. I find shadows especially beautiful, I'm sure that it holds some underlying meaning to it that I find shadows pretty. Something about how since I like them that I feel that I'm in the shadows of life, but maybe I am. I just feel more alive sometimes when I sit outside in absolute stillness and let everything live around me. I feel as if I'm living with it. Strange I know, but true. I have always felt that if I were to die I would like to die lying in a field in the afternoon listening to music. I have a picture by PROPNAME that reminds me of a field that was behind my house when I was younger. It seems that those times were so much better than times are now. I wonder if I'll ever be as happy as I was back then again someday. And I'm not alone in that thought. Responsibilities just keep piling up day by day and I just wish that there were a break. It would be nice to be a rock star someday, I feel that if I were up there on stage that I would be so much happier. But I know that I probably would feel the same as I do now. I need to do something that will get me recognized someday, I feel as if I'm destined for fame somehow. But as it is now I feel like I'll end up in a dead end life like most others. I know that most say that there are many other things that make life worth living even though they have a job that they hate. But I would rather be a bum then have a job that I hated. I would feel like I sold myself out in someway. Transcendence is something that has always interested me. Mostly the idea that I could transcend life and become something greater than it. The way the words come off ones tongue when they say that makes me feel warm. I envy authors that have a mastery of language. It would be awesome to write something that when people read it they would be overcome with emotions. Hopefully I'll make enough money in my life that I can stop working and spend all my time making music. I just wish I had the balls to become a musician and do what I want, but if I do I feel like I'll be a failure to all those that I've told that I'm going to be a doctor and what not. Its a nice business its just that there isn't much recognition in it unless you put your whole life in it. And I don't think that I could put my whole life into it since I don't think I would enjoy it. 
__label__label0 Right now I am a little worried that I am not doing this right because I don't really know what I am suppose to be writing about. Well, I am excited because my best friend, PROPNAME, is going to be in LOCNAME in about two hours. She started school in LOCNAME about two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since then. We are going to the lake tomorrow and Labor Day and I can't wait. I love going to the lake with PROPNAME because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. I am excited about school starting. I have always planned on coming to LOCNAME, but I never thought the day would ever actually come. All my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. I think that I will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester I am going to have to take a nursing 000 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that I have to give. I hate giving speeches. I always think that I'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech I start to shake and sweat. I am getting better at it though. I believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. My freshman year in high school I was terrified of getting up in front of the class. I would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what I was saying. It was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. During my junior year I was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior I played at region band and almost made district. I also performed skits and memorized a Shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. I am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that I don't know very well. It's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that I know well or my family and friends. I just feel like people that I don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. Now I just try to forget about that and try to focus on what I have to say. As a nurse I will have to deal with people a lot. I enjoy talking to people one on one, but I will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so I will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. I hope that by the time I graduate college I will have no problem speaking in front of people and that I might even enjoy it. 
__label__label1 . I never thought it would be this hard to think about my stream of consciousness. Now that I am aware that I am actually thinking to myself, it makes it really difficult to think normally. I keep giving myself all these weird things to write about but really none of them are really representational of the real way I think. My thoughts are usually random and irrelevant to anything going on around me. You could say I daydream often. I really wish that I were doing this in a quiet room because the things going on around me are effecting what I want to type about. PROPNAME, my roommate, is usually in the library so I guess I should have taken advantage of that earlier and done this assignment then. My attention span is short. I keep finding myself drawn into her conversation. It makes me think about talking to my friends on the phone, which eventually leads to me reminiscing about some past event involving my friends. The funny thing about my situation now, is that only actual people talking, interrupts my thought process. The television doesn't disturb me at all. I have gotten very good at tuning it out. Maybe its because I have made it a habit of doing just about everything with the television on, including sleeping. I am growing impatient with the time now. It seems like 00 minutes has gone by, but when I check my clock it always reads the same. Time always passes slowly when you grow anxious for a certain amount of it to pass. This assignment is difficult for me. I am really having trouble recording my natural thought process instead of just making these random thoughts up for the sake of using up my 00 minutes. I just keep looking around my room hoping that it will spark some thought and give me something more to write about instead of this meaningless rambling. I don't know, my mind is blank now; I am pretty much out of time, so I think I will end on this statement. 
__label__label0 Wow, those life savers look really good. hot pockets remind me of LOCNAME powers that's a funny movie. I can't wait to go home. I miss a bunch of my friends there and homecoming will be a ton of fun. hey that guy was in the wonder years. I wish tatiana and I could talk about serious topics for once all we do is jokingly insult each other. Zoo keepers?? we can't be zoo keepers, we have to be a famous hollywood couple. The retreat this weekend is going to be so fun and then we'll get to watch the football game! I hope I'll be able to get some studying done. I really need to do better in Spanish, I'm not doing too well in there. I wonder how my campers are doing. Two of them are online right now. Lunch should be pretty fun today. I'm glad classes are finally over, for this week at least. That guy looks really funny with that blue towel around his head. Where are all those loud guys in our hallway. Saturday Night Live used to be such a funny showwhat happened to it?? PROPNAME PROPNAME was one of the funniest guys around. PROPNAME PROPNAME was in True Liesthat was a GREAT movie. 
__label__label0 I guess I'll just start out by explaining how I feel right now. Because of school, I've been feeling really stressed. Although because of our class I'm not really sure what stress is. To me stress is when I have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. I feel like my whole life is school right now. I live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. By the time I get to my dorm in between classes I have to leave in 00 minutes to get to another class 00 minutes away. The days have been going by really fast though. I'm always so busy. I try to just get my work done during the week so I can go out on the weekend and have fun. I'm really excited about college because already I've learned so much. I feel like I'm being able to think better about things. Or I guess maybe deeper about things. Not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. I've begun to think more about what I want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. I guess you sort of have to be like that at LOCNAME, because there are so many people. In high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. A lot of the classes push that during the discussion times I guess because the classes are so large. Our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else I talk to have an even smaller class than I did. It's really weird but I keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. I know of 0 people that are in 0 of my classes. Maybe it's just that I recognize them. I still don't really know what to expect from my classes. Most of them seem interesting except for Calculus and Economics. I really like the experiments we do in class. Ugh, I can't think of anything else to write about. I hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. Actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. So I guess it's sort of like a journal. I actually don't feel as stressed now that I've gotten this done. It's one less thing I have to worry about. Now I have to figure out how to copy and paste it. I'm not very good with computers. 
__label__label0 I am here, miles and miles away from where I started. things are progressing slowly but I can see what I want now. yes for a moment it seems oh so clear and then it fades. it does not matter what I do with my life only that I am alive. anything besides being alive is what the time was like before I was born nothing. I do not fear this nothing however I just know it will be at the end of all my experiences. so I better make these experiences count. there is no resting no relaxing when there are times to be had. I again get distracted though. this body I inhabit continually calls upon me to fulfill its need. if it is not this it is that. but it is the only place my mind has to stay. sure it is a great tool beautiful in a way but I feel the drive to leave it behind. I spend many passages of time trying to discover what feeds the burning inside of me, what will motivate me to take a task to a great level. I want to design I want to build I want to create. a need is present to put something not just something but something carefully crafted out there for others to take in and make it part of their entities. I alone have fed off what others before me have so delicately created and taken it in through my eyes and ears and other senses. all those creations have helped craft the person that I am. so I know it is time to project all this back outwards with a spin that is all my own. and when I do this I must not think about it I must subconsciously perform using the feeling that lay inside me. I have found a companion. we have discovered that when we combine our idea our thought our joy our pain it becomes a thing of greater nature. we are translating our combined impulses into a media, a media that will allow this combination of raw human toil to be available for others if they so choose to spend the time taking it in and seeing if it is a part of them as well. 
__label__label0 It is late, and I know I should have started this earlier tonight, but I procrastinate. I wonder if the perfect guy for me is out there somewhere and thinking about me right now and I do not even know. I just put to rest my last relationship. Too bad I messed things up with a great guy for a guy who treats me badly even though I love the guy who treats me badly. I hate that he is in my head every day, every minute. I tell people I have put him out of my life, but is he really? Every time I say that he comes back into my life and I love him even more than I did the time before. I hope that God is up there on his thrown writing down in my life book that I will meet my perfect mate tomorrow and when I do I will just know that he is the one for me. I would get married at a young age if it was the right guy and he asked me to marry him. I hate when my stepmother tells me I should wait until I have lived alone for a few years before I get married. Just because that is what she did does not mean that it is what I should do. Every person is different and I should follow my heart. I'm quite scared though because my mom did not have good luck with finding a wonderful man to share her life with. I mean, my dad cheated on her and my stepfather beat her. I hope it is not genetic. I don't know if I am willing to stand out in the heat tomorrow and Thursday to draw for football tickets. I want to see the OU game, but I really want to see it from the comforts of my home. Plus, I do not have a date and everyone else will and I will feel out of place. My roommate is with her boyfriend. I am jealous of her because she has a great boyfriend and I want one too. I spotted this goodlooking guy in my philosophy discussion group and I would like to get to know him more. I have emailed him though and he hasn't emailed me back. I think that I saw him tonight while I was walking down the street, but I did not want to stare, so I could not get a very good look. I am looking forward to getting married and waking up in the same arms every morning. I even have everything for my perfect wedding planned out. I want to get married on the same day my grandparents did and I want to have a big orchestra playing my favorite slow songs. I wish that I would be walking down the aisle to PROPNAME, but he does not want me. If he did I would be the happiest girl in the world. He makes me feel like a princess when I am with him and he is treating me right. I only wish that one day he will open his eyes and realize what he gave up because he said he wanted to be "free". I guess I did mess things up with him though because I lied to another guy. I was just so confused this summer and I did not know what I wanted if I could not have PROPNAME. He would be my first choice over any guy in the world and it should not be like that because he hurts me so many times too. I just loved being with him. I wondered if my grandparents knew that they would be together for so long when they were married fiftyseven years ago. I think that is so special and I would thank God every day if I had that same thing happen to me. I am thirsty, but I am too lazy to get up right now. I hope that I can get my two friends together soon. It is weird that the guy that is like my brother now is the first boy I ever kissed. It was so long ago though. Who would have thought that he and I would be so close now that it would be like we were brother and sister? 
__label__label0 This is very odd trying to track my thoughts by doing this. All I can think of right now is I can't type as fast as I think. I am slow at typing in general but this makes it even harder. So lets see what do we talk about. Today I have a long day cause I have four classes and I don't get home until late. Mondays and Wednesdays are my longest days. Anyways, this weekend my goal is to be caught up with all my reading and all the things I have to do for my classes. I have been enjoying college so far but I don't like the work aspect of it. There is just so much reading and constant memorizing and remembering it. It wasn't like this in high school but then again I am not in high school anymore. Let's see what else. My roommate spelled rice all over our room carpet just a minute go and now the room smells like Chinese food. She cleaned it all up but now the rug is greasy. So after I finish typing I will clean the carpet so it's not so greasy anymore. I am looking at the clock and I only have been typing for 0 minutes. I am tired already of this. I am looking at my little cousins' pictures right and I miss them very much. It's lonely here in college but I am working on having fun. But there doesn't seem like a whole lot to do that doesn't involve alcohol in some way. Everyone seems to just want to get junk and pass out and not even remember what they did the night before. I am not much of a drinker and certainly not to the point of getting junk and passing out. I like to just go out with friends and hang out and talk like we used to, but most of my friends are so spread out that we have to do the email thing for now. I like email because its' just wonderful. There are no long distance charges and you can send it in a second to anyone anywhere in the world. Oneday people are going to not be able to remember their lives before email. I don't even think they can now. I still can because I was just a freshman in high school when it first started getting popular. But I still like the days when we were not so technology driven. I like the later 00's and early 00's. Though I am not that old I can still remember those times where things didn't seem to be so fast paced. And now everyone is trying to be millionaire and wanting more and more of material things and just wanting to have a "good time" and not really caring in depth about things and people. Its just use and get ride of the next day. But then again there are other people who don't do this. I don't know. Now I am looking at the clock and seeing that I have been typing for fifteen minutes now and my fingers are getting really tired. I am glad I ate before I did this cause then I really would have been annoyed with this. Looks like it's going to be another hot day. I want it to cool down but I don't want it to rain when we have to go to class. It can rain on the weekend but not while we have to go to class cause that would cause more headaches. Anyways, I just want to be home right now. I want to be in my car and drive to the mall or just whatever. I miss being at home and I didn't get much of a summer this summer cause I was so busy preparing for college and making a list of things to buy and packing, and going and being in camp and just lots of stuff that I needed some more time of relaxation and enjoyment. Will I have about one more minutes of typing so I guess this is it. I don't know what I am even saying. Oh there I hit the 00minute mark ok I am going to stop typing now, goodbye. 
__label__label0 Hello, I am so stressed right now with school. I am swamped with things to do. I don't even know where to begin I have so much. I am trying to get everything done because I am going home this weekend I don't want a lot to do. This is the first time for me to be home since I have been in college. I am really excited. I cannot wait to get away from everything. I wish I could have one day where I didn't have to do anything. I want to workout but I don't even have the time to do that. I don't see how people have jobs or be in a sorority or fraternity in school. I barely get everything done and I am not in them. They do stuff together almost every single night. I can't think of anything else right now except about what I have to do. I cannot wait until the LOCNAME and ORGNAME game, it is going to be so much fun. I also cannot wait to see my family. I think I am a little home sick. I think I keep pushing the submit button when I am writing I hope that's okay. I don't mean to do that, but my laptop is messed up or something. Anyway, I have been so busy that I haven't had time to call my friends or family. I have friends that go to this school but I never see them and hardly hear from them. I am so glad that I got a ticket to the OU game because I am one of the very few who doesn't have to wait in line. This reminds me of an assignment we had to do in high school. It was called power writing and we would have to write for two minutes about a topic and whoever had the most words at the very end won a prize. I was always the winner. People in the class would try to beat me and they never could. I guess I am just a fast writer. I really hope that it is okay that I pushed the submit button. It was an accident. I just figured out why that was happening and I think I fixed it. Just disregard the unfinished versions of this. I can't believe that I still have more than five minutes to keep typing. After this I still have so much to do tonight. I can't wait until this weekend so I can shopping and wash my car, but I still have to write a paper sometime during this break. also want to go out to eat while I am there. I haven't done that in a while. I accidentally pushed that button again I hope that it is okay. Anyway I am so tired and I really want to take a nap. I haven't gotten much sleep lately although I got more than I ever did in high school. In high school I got less sleep and did more physical work than I do now. I think my time is already up. 
__label__label1 I have no idea wher to begin. Im sitting in my dorm and the sound of th a. c. and the fans is driving me crazy. Its like either be hot or be completely annoyed. Besides that, I have twenty different other things on my mind. Am I going to bo to the SI session tonight or am I just going to study so I can go out tonight? Should I even go out tonight? I feel so nervous all the time that Im not using my time wisely. I don't feel at home in this dorm yet so its hard for me to have an organized lifestyle that I am comfortable with. I am so hungry but if I take the time to eat I could be taking time out of other things and I still have another 00 minutes to write so I really can't stop to eat yet. Mainly food is on my mind along with allthe other things I still need to do. It seems like it never ends. Its wierd because when I am studying I feel so enlightened by learning things and I also feel like I am getting a lot accomplished but when I am not studying no matter what the reason, I feel like I am wasting time or getting behind. I wish I could know where I stand compared to the other students as far as knowledge and studying goes. I am so tired and overwhelmed and excited all at once about everything that my mind is going crazy. This whole writing thing is also making me crazy because at times I can't think of what to write and I feel like I have to be constantly writing. Peolpe keep calling my cell phone and I want to answer it but I don't want to loose my train of thought but I guess that doesnt matter because as long as I write what I am thinking its ok but whatever. I keep worrying that the thinking that the things I am writing are making me sound depressed and that along with prof. PROPNAME saying that most college students are depressed really disturbs me because I am not one to be depressed and it doesnt sound very fun. I feel really bad that I am ignoring these phone calls because i always seem to ignore the person who is calling. 
__label__label1      So, it's a Tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. I ate dinner earlier and can   feel the food digesting. I am rather anxious about something. Not terribly that it is   distracting, but I feel as though I am expecting something. It might be that I am   nervous about school. It's a new place for me, coming from LOCNAME. I haven't   really made my close group of friends. Sure, I've been having loads of fun, but I   still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. I haven't found my niche.   It's almost like I am waiting for it to be a month from now when I've found my place.   It's also hard in class, becuase I don't know many, hardly any at all, people in   them. I don't have people where I can go to work on projects or anything. This   makes me a little worried about how I am going to do, becuase I can't compare   answers on homework with friends, and I can't discuss new concepts with anyone.   I think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more   stressful than I originally expected. But I am not worried because there are so   many people here that I know it can't be too long before I find my place. Austin is a   great city also. That's a definite plus. The city has just a great atmosphere. I've   seen two concerts here and I love it. I can't wait to see even more of the city and   it's cool places. Music is a big part of my life and I think that is really going to make   me happy. It's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or   something I will love to do. I am really excited to get to know some of the local   musicians. That'll be cool. I also have feelings that I want to have a girlfriend. I don't really know what I want   sexually. I feel like I want a steady girlfriend. Someone who I can always be close   with. I really think that will help make my transition into LOCNAME easier. But it's hard   for me to find someone who I'll get along with this well. Another thing I think about   is committment. I dont' know if I want a long term relationship. Also, would it be to   distracting for be because of school?  I certainly know that school is my priority, but   now that I'm in college, I have to discover how much time I really need to spend   doing work to maintain my ORGNAME. I think that the first semester is the hardest   because it's a new atmosphere and I have to test the limits and such.   Another thing that kind of worries me is my suitemate. He is a big partier, and   although I like to party some, he's always up very late at night and is usually very   loud. It's hard for me to tell whether it will last or if it's just the first week of school   and he's really excited. I just hope that he will get to studying. I am sur that all will   work out. I really feel that things usually do work out, and eventually I will feel   hapiness and the anxious feeling will go away. I'm just anxious to not be anxious   anymore. 
__label__label1      You know, I just don't know how to schedual my workouts and PROPNAME PROPNAME Do sessions. I think that four workout days and three tae kwon do days in a week sound pretty good. I could do chest, tris, and shoulders on Sunday, PROPNAME PROPNAME do on Monday, quads and hams on Tuesday, Tae Kwon Do on Wednesday, back and bis on Thursdays, Tae Kwon Do on Fridays, Calves and inner, outer and glutes on Saturday. I like that schedual because my time is not fully committed to one area of interest. I used to work out every day of the week. I also can't do that anymore because my interests in the martial arts prohibit me from emulating PROPNAME PROPNAME. The German Giant! That guy is swool. I think that's how you speel swool. As in it's swoolen. Hum, maybe it's swolen. Whatever, who cares? An English teacher ya but on stream of consiousness? Besides, what if my consiousness doesn't want me to spell it right. Maybe my mind is secretly liberal and is telling me to go against the 'establishment'. 'Damn the Man' and 'down with big brother'  and all of that. Maybe it's my secret way of avoiding conformity. That all sounds like bullshit to me but who can say otherwise besides me. I guess everyone now that I've said it's b. s. but that's not the point. The point is, of this tiny fragment of thought anyway, is that I could basically come up withany excuse I wanted to explain my actions and no one could say otherwise. Why can't you go up on the 'stand' and declare yourself that you were insane at the time of the murder. I mean, expertise and all that junk doesn't insure that from one, or maybe even no meeting at all, meeting a psychologist can determine that the accused was insane at the time of the crime. Does it really even make it more likely? Lets say that my mom was killed. I'd be pretty pissed and I'd break things and fight and all that fun stuff but would I classify myself as insane at the time? No, to myself anyway. If it could get me out of trouble ya, but I would know that I was really just pissed off and sad and all like that. But whatever, how can I talk about this? I have no credentials. Which brings up another point, why do you need credentials? Why do people always quote other people in research papers. I'm mostly talking about philosophy papers and diplomatic position papers. Why quote PROPNAME, was he so enormously intellegent that all your oqn thoughts are irrelevent? Why not write a paper about what you think? Maybe you have read some of PROPNAME's writing, then perhaps you should discuss your thoughts on that but why form an opinion entirely off what other people have said? What does that make you?  A follower, a person who does nothing but agrees. Whats that all about? How could anyone live just agreeing. It really does annoy me though, how people, some people, just quote other people. It's like you can't be wrong if you go with what some dead guy said. I say go with what you say. What's wrong with that. I'm going to make it a point to quote myself int he next paper I write fro psychology. I know that writing a position paper on an issue is your opinion but is it really YOUR opinion if you've already read what someone else has to say. I'd like to do nothing but read purely data filled reports and form my own opinions on what is going on. I also refuse to validate my position by incorporating a quote from a famous dead guy, or an alive one. What I say has importance because I am intelligent. 
__label__label0 I am here in LOCNAME's library. I just finished talking with my mum on line. She is back in LOCNAME. Thought she is far away from me, every time I am talking with her, I feel that we are really close to each other. It is 0pm on Monday night, but I don't really feel hungry, though when I am thinking about the lunch I brought here with me, I feel like having it. Some fruits and a corn.   Though this is the beginning of the semester, I feel like I am having a lot more to do than usual. I guess this is the difference between big unversity and a small college    There are five classes I am taking this semester. Except the markering one, the lecture are all fine to me. However, I bet the exams going to be hard. I have to work hard to get a good GPA, then get into the program I want.   The work on campus is all right. Not so fun and changlleging. Kind of boring. I am not really learning a lot from it. The good thing is that one of the bosses is nice. He makes me feel like there is someone appreciate my 0 and half hours work in the morning. I guess, people usually using new ones harder. I don't see anyone else working as hard as I do. Basically, everyone is chatting and eating. Frankly, I'd rather work instead of chatting. But just not like this. You know what I am saying? Anyway, I hope I am going to get used to it soon.   I love to cook my own food. Saving money and tast good. But i just don't have much time to do so once school starts. So basically, I bring simple food to school or just eat somewhere else.   I have lot needs to be done tonight and hopefully I will survive tomorrow.          
__label__label1 i wonder if kyle will call. he lies all the time kyle listening to music reminds me about kyle, about our relationship about how good it was, he used to be so sweet, kissing me and i know that he really did love me at one time, why has everything changed, why does he still tell me he loves me but acts mean to me, i hate that he tells me i shoudldnt go out and party and have fun because he does it too, he gets involved with others while i just window shop at guys, im just not attracted to some of the gusy here, they are morons, they have money stuck on their minds along with sex. i don't feel pretty enough for some of the nice guys that i do meet, i have gained sooo much weight in the last two years, fat. i feel so fat, i can't wear anything anymore because it looks so terrible, i used to feel pretty and normal back home where i everyone seemed to love me, I've been so homesick, i miss my granny and janie and kyles family. i worry about tara back home, if shes making the right decisions if she really will go to college, i at least want her to go to kc i don't want her to end up like everyone else in kilgore, they end up working at some department store making minimum wage and haveing five babies and getting on food stamps. shes better than that. i love her and want her to not end up my mom. i hate my mother. she has to be the worst person ever to just leave me behind, to leave me like i don't matter, to not come to my graduation, to not try to see me to leave me for a man that she doesnt love. she was so wrong to my dad. i wish she would go to prison and i hate her so much. i can't be like her i can't end up like her. i will never hurt my children when im a mom. i will be a good mother. a mom who plays tea party and who devotes her life to them. they will be my world. i wonder if ill marry kyle, i wonder if he will be the father of my children. i hate not knowing how he feels. he pisses me off. he says he loves me and at time i really think he does but then  he treats me like shit too. i wish i could say no to him but it always seems so impossible. i love him. everything reminds me of him. every conversation i have involves his name everything i hear or see reminds me of the good times we had. we were in love. a guy just doesnt do the stupid things he does. but then why did he have to reverse all that. why did he date that trish when he left to go to college, we were together and he dated her and i really don't trust him. hes nothing but a big mystery to me. what is it about him, what is missing that i don't know about. i feel like hes hiding something really really bad from me. he used to scare me when he said hes involved in the mafia. i believe him some of the time. its weird how everything he says is right. hes so weird. kyle is reallly really weird. i want to go see him. i want him to take me to a football game. i wonder why he liked me. i was five years younger than him. a baby compared to him. he never had a girlfriend until me. not a serious one anyway, just girls that he played and used. what made him fall in love with me. what makes him have control over me. i let him. everythihng he does is my fault becuase i let him do it. i let hime make me feel bad but i don't know how to get away from that. i feel like hes the only person in this world that knows everything about me. everything and hes the only one that understands everything i do and have been through. i miss him. i hate him too. i really want to cry this music im listening to is so damn depressing. bryan adams. romantic music. this reminds me of back home. i miss kilgore, i hated it when i left and now i miss it. its small but a good town. im ready to go to homecoming. i wonder if ill have any attention. i used to remember the college kids coming hnome for the first time and how cool it was. i wonder if people will be happy to see me. i wonder if they will think i look different. freshman fifteen surely not in a month. its alcohol. i think i drink too much. i miss riding by myslef with a case on the backroads back in kilgore. those were the days. 
__label__label1  Hi, my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am a new student at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I absolutely love it here! It is so much more than I expected. I am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here. I didn't know anyone here when I came so I decided to go through the rush process and go greek. I was very disappointd in the greek system. They are so political here in LOCNAME. I felt like I was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents didn't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush. A lot of the legacy stuff didn't make sense to me. Oh well, I ended up pledging PROPNAME PROPNAME and I absolutely love it !  The sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun!  I have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already. Right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and I am typing this for my new psych class. I am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend. We were together for the past year and I was so in love with him, but he was 00 and I was 00 and that 's not a bad age difference, but he just wanted to party all of the time, which is okay, but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me. That also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so I broke up with him. But I still miss him so much. But moving to LOCNAME is a good thing for me because I am away from everyithing from back home and I can start all over. He wasn't good for me at the time. Hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out, but until then I am not putting up with that and i can do better. I love the new girls in my sorority, they are so sweet!  It made me think of that because  a new friend of mine PROPNAME, knew PROPNAME, my x-boyfriend, and they were friends their senior year. Its knda crazy becasue I am from LOCNAME, an hour north of dallas, she is from LOCNAME, and he is from Prosper. I met PROPNAME at the lake when I was modeling for a swimsuit store. We fell in love and spent the next year together. ANyways, i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me. Everytime I talk to them they arelik how are yoyr grades?  When it has only been 0 weeks and this is like the first assisnment I have turned in. They are so worried that I am just down here partying and not going to class. I don't know why they think that because coming to ORGNAME has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl!  I am so happy here!  My mom got upset with me last night  becasue i told her I was going to the ORGNAME vs. LOCNAME game in LOCNAME LOCNAME and she said no, and I said well I'm old enought to make my own decisions now. Why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun?  And then I was going to eat dinner at 00:00 at night and she flipped out on me because I had class the next day. She is being unreal. And I havne't talked to my dad in over a week because we just argue about how i should be using my time wisely at college. I don't even want to go home and visit anymore. I have always had a good relationship with both of myparents so I don't know why now it is a problem. I love them to death but I just can't talk to them for a couple of days. My roommate is cool, but she sometimes gets on my nerves. She never cleans up after hersolf and she always has one of her two boyfriend over here (that don't know about one another) and she is sleeping with both of them and then asks me to cover for her. but at the same time she is doing their laundry here and being inconsiderate of me. I don;'t know, i'm just really stressed out right now. MY new friends here ar eawesome though. I guess I keep talking about them because this is the first time in 0 years that I havene't had a serious boyfriend. But I like the single life sometimes, I don't have to answer to anybody or call in and check in with anyone anymore. My friends just fight with their boyriends all of the time. I came from a small town where you were able to be involved in everything. I played basketball, ran track, softball, was a cheerleader all thourhg school, did student council, sisters of service, fellowship of christian athletes, and took a few leadership roles and it was great. But a lot of girls hated me for it. I was alway ssweet to everyone but the girls always taked bad about me because I was friends with their boyfriends or was with the guy they wantred. Now that I am in LOCNAME, i don't have to worry about jelaous girls anymore. Which is so awesome. I used to come home from school and cheerleading practice crying because of some of the things the girls would say to me. THey were so hateful and mean. I loved to cheerlead, but half way through my senior year iI quit cheerleadeing because the girls got so bad. It was really messed up. I always argued with our sponsor because she didn't like me and I had no respect for her because she cheated on her husband and slept with the football coach and she was just horrible. And then she tried to date my boyfriend. This was our sponsor, what kind of authority position was she to be in?  Anyways, this is just what all is on my mind . I will make my parents happy and come home with awesome grades this semester abd they will be so proud of me!  That is my main goal in life right now!       
__label__label0 Well, here I am on Friday, September something. Ever since I started college I've had a hard time keeping up with the date. Not really a smart thing to do since I have to stay on top of things here. I need to start keeping a daily planner. I say that everyday but then I forget to do it and it's just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do. I'm pretty hungry right now. No, I take that back, I'm not that hungry. I could eat but it's not to the point where I feel like I have to eat. My friend and I are going to lunch today. I'm so glad that I've made a friend that I can hang out with and talk to all the time. It's not the same like my friends at home though. I miss PROPNAME and Amber. I really don't know why it is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking. We talk about nsync a lot more now too. Typical, we find comfort in them in our time of need. I wonder if the nsync guys would think that we're crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who PROPNAME belongs to and who JC belongs to. They crack me up. Heck, I crack myself up. We talk on the phone and I have PROPNAME and Amber rolling on the floor with laughter. It's so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually I'm the one doing the laughter. A lot of times I just laugh to be polite. I fake it pretty well, if I do say so myself. I wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs? Well, if this is just my one continuous thought then I guess not. Okay, I love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes, could somebody please turn up the air conditioning. I think the ORGNAME is trying to freeze us into studying. I hope they know that they're just freezing me into complaining all the time. And another thing, is it impossible for people to not slam their doors? Really, it doesn't take that much effort to quietly close the door. I should randomly slam my door. I think every hour on the hour, I'm going to slam my door. No, that's not frequent enough. I'll slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point. Really though, dorm life is not bad at all. My dorm room is so cute and I really like my roommate. No waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting. I still don't like to call this place home. Home is where Mom and PROPNAME are. This is where I reside. It would take a lot for me to consider this place home. I need to do my Biology homework. I wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are? The funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives. I can't even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I'm pretty sure that life as a professional bum is out of the question. Don't think Mom would be proud of me then. Okay, looks like my time is running out and I should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence. Okay, how do I end this. I really don't know. This was actually kind of fun. Just another way for me to analyze my random, boring, and crazy thoughts. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME on VH0 now. Got to go. And we're out in 0,  0,    0,   0,   0. Bye! (It says that I can finish writing, but honestly I got a date with a fine young man named Biology)  
__label__label1      Well here i sit at college and Its kind of weird. IN the next room there is music playing which I like. It makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that I went to. It was in good ole LOCNAME, and I was Occumpanied by my cousin. Now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending ORGNAME ORGNAME. She now lives in LOCNAME, what a tough life. My room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. I always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. Actually it is quite organized. I have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as I have grown older I have realized that indeed I do enjoy some sense of organization. My roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that I have. Coming from LOCNAME, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from LOCNAME. A friend away from home you could say. My connection in the bussiness. . haha, I didnt always live there though, I came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. Im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but I do remember that it was right before I entered High school and it was still a major adjustment. I went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. My high school that is. Now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. That is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than I could have imagined on that friday night. Nothing could go right. I miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. You never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. I have not written much lately, and I know that I should have been writing every day. I once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. That and reading, but I know that I will have no shortage of reading this year. I have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. I enjoy reading. I guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. When your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. You think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. Somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. Inspire or say something meaningful. Its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. With so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. You can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. You have to find the median. The happy place you could say. Not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. You can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. You have to make it happen. As clich'e as it sounds, its true. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME and the Stones,   You can't always get what you want. .   You could say that they truly are wise old men. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. Amen brother. Spoken by a true poet. I have always liked comedy in my writing. Not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. I mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. If they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. It was a wasted tree. Often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. I by no means claim to be a great writer nor do I claim to make people laugh, I am simply claiming that I like to laugh as I read. I enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. If it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. It is a shame that I do not write as much as I used to. The Ideas are there, I just have not gotten them out yet. They will be there, it will just take time. I guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. My memory is not the greatest right now, at 00 years old. When I hit seventy or beyond, I can't wait until I have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. . 
__label__label1      I am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, LOCNAME. It is overwhelming right now solely because I don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. I enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. My goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. I am feeling a little homesick though, because I am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. I miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. I am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. Everyone knows eachother and I sometimes feel alienated. I am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. Which causes me to lose concentration at times. It is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. Especially at night when they come running in all drunk. I smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging Theta. My roommate and I just got through with PROPNAME and are excited about our new sorority. I know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. I am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. It is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. Im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. I realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that I will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. I love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. Our room is all tidy and neat. I know my mom would be happy. I really love this city of LOCNAME. It is so fun and such a party place. It also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. I'm not all into this every night party life. Don't get me wrong I love to party and all, but to a certain extent. I'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. You become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. One thing I want to do while at school here for the next 0 years is discover who I really am. When you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? I want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. I am contemplating on whether I want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. It seems like im always on the go here, too. There is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. As you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. I notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. My computer just froze for the longest time so for about 0 minutes I couldn't write. So i am going to start again, because for 0 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. It is making me very aggravated. So in case you know this I am still typing after the 00 min time period, because 0 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. Well, I am hoping that I will learn my away around LOCNAME soon because this city is very confusing. I just want to have a notion of where everything is. I hate not knowing my way around places. Well, I am going to end it now because I timed an extra 0 min on my clock and it is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     j                                                                                                                                                                                              m                        y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
__label__label0 I don't like being home alone as much as i thought i would like it. i want PROPNAME to come back already. i can't believe she also takes zoloft this is too weird. i kinnda want her to be normal because now i just think the both of us are too weird together. it was such a coincidence that we got paired up together as roomates. i was talking to chris and everytime i do i feel so much more homesick. i can't decide if like him or not. well i like him. but i don't know if i like him more than a friend. i probably like william more. yes i do. i wonder what he is doing right now. it is raining and i don't like that. i hate the rain. i feel scared that something bad will happen. this song is funny. i guess they don't like jermaine dupri. i had some really good french vanilla coffee but now my throat hurts because it was way too hot. i really miss charm and all the guys. i felt so sad because they went out without me. ok the comp just made a strange noise that i don't like. that really scared me i thought i had broken talia's computer. i would really be in trouble then. damn it feels like i've been writing for longer than 0 mins. but oh well. i wonder wat chris is doing right at this moment. i wish i could see him. he can always make me laugh. speaking of funny people, i really miss emy. he's the love of my life, without it being in any way romantic. i would do anything for him and i worry about him so much. i really hope he is doing ok because if he isn't i would drop everything hear in austin just to be with him. the people in my floor piss me off all the time because they are always yelling and i can't stand that they don't have the courtesy to be quiet at night. they really annoy me. i wonder if that comedy show is going to be on tonight. i really like that show. i wish i had more of that coffee. even though it burned my throat. i ate pizza today and it wasn't the best thing in the world. i'm going to remember that for next time. i eat way too much sometimes. i am so fat i don't need to eat more. how the hell did i get to weigh so much?  i just can't believe it. i hate walking around and seeing all those pretty girls. i spend most of the day being jealus of them all. i don't know how to make myself stop eating and to start working out. i mean i have a gym right downstairs but even that embarrasses me because i don't want people to see the fat girl working out. that's why people work out, to lose weight. but i just can't get out of that mindset. it is way too cold in my room. i'm going to get sick. i have to do so much homework. especially biology because i don't understand anything in that class and we might have a quiz next week. i won't do too good on that. chemistry is pretty good i think. i got a little confused last night with the homework but i'm hoping to work that out. biology 000 is not that bad. at least i don't feel like falling asleep right then and there like in bio 000, i really don't like my instructor. she's so damn boring and she tries to be funny but i doesn't work. i really hope i don't do too bad this semester. i hope to get at least b's in all my classes. a's are impossible in college i think. i'm really worried about my scholarship from d. d. hachar, i haven't gotten the half from ORGNAME that i'm supposed to get. i really should call the office or stop by. and i should also go and settle the matter with the mental health office too, i don't want maribel to keep bugging me about it. this is really not cool, i don't want to have to do that. but oh well. i guess if i have to. i should write an email to the finacial aid office asking them about my scholarship. or maybe i should try to contact the nursing school. maybe i don't even have that scholarship anymore. that would suck if i don't. i really need the money. i don't want my parents to worry about me or money. i can't wait until i have money of my own to help them out. i wonder if i'll ever become famous like i always dream about. i dream about so many things itz hard to keep track. i'm almost done. wow, that went by quickly. this wasn't so bad. i wonder if they're really going to read this thing. i doubt they have time. 
__label__label0      College? I wonder how it will be? I just started it. It seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but I wonder is it something I will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         This is my first time living away from home and the ones I love and care about it. I feel the necessity to show to my peers that I'm not scared and do not miss home. But in fact i miss my home and my sister who I fought with all times. I don't know why I feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. I can't understand that part of my mind. Is it because I want to fit in the croud? Is it because I want to show others that I'm strong?           On the other hand - I love what I have been experiencing for the past week. I have experienced things I have never before. I never had to do mylaundry myself and now I do that and I find that I like doing it. I have to go to eat myself. At home the plate was always on the dinner. I feel as if I was spoiled at home and that I was given too much. Here I realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. And that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  I have learnt to handle things on my own. At home, if i met someone I didnt like, it was as if  I ignored them but here I realized that it is difficult to ignore 00000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . So far I can say that college has taught me more than I thought it would.          College is not the only thing on my mind. I think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? How will I manage to survive financially? If I will make a good living in the future? I question myself why I think so much about the future and so little about the present. I give undue importance to the future and not to the present. My thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. Things done turn out the way i want them to. I end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          But thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. I question myself if I really do believe in God. My faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. Losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but I coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. But when I lost when my father, I really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person I was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. I decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. But when i lost her at the age of 00, I thought forget God. He doesnt exist. However looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in God. I wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        I used to always think about eating food. But since the past year that it had changed. But i'm back to the way i was. I wonder if I'm a emotional eater? When i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. However when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. I would love to visit a shrink to get to know if I'm a emotional eater. 
__label__label1     Its hard to start anywhere I guess I feel like I'm being analyzed   for what I'm writing, but I know that it doesnt mean anything, that   twenty minutes of writing can't really say everything about me. class   somewhat worries me, I know I've taken 0 some odd AP classes yet   i still don't feel like i'm prepared, i just have to stay focused, i hope   that doesnt bother taylor to much but he's just going to have to learn   that it takes me a while to study and that has to come first. Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems. The worst battles are those that come out of ignorance,   and people learn how to float the system of books and test, but it   would be harder to ignore real human interaction, there seems to be   so much misunderstanding in the world simply because people   don't interact and learn who's really out there, so much of humanitys   misery could be qualmed if only people spent time physically   interacting with humanity. Its easier to disregard a text than it is to   disregard a human. but i suppose not very many people see it that   way. I wonder if this is where im supposed to be or if there is some   greater plan out there for me, i wish i knew, but i guess thats life, the   suprise of the future, the unknow of the big picture, everyone goes   through it I suppose i just have to as well. I'm tired of pouring out my   thoughts to a page, i want to talk to people, people who think like   me, i think PROPNAME PROPNAME is the most amazing person ever, her   attitude toward people is superfluous with love. she just is the most   beautifully person inside and out, she is a role model for the way to   look and society and people, i hope to gain a lot of the knowledge   that she has. I'll just keep reading her books, i need to check out the   library and see what else they have, too bad i never have time to   read what i want to and what really enhances my life because im   stuck reading textbooks for hours. I hope i get to join the crew team it   will be really exciting if im actually around athletic people, maybe it   will get me off my butt, lord knows i need to. oh well, 00 minutes   done, gosh that flew by, it was a nice writing assignment, i wish we   could have more like that. This   open your door    thing next week is   going to fabulous im exciting about people stopping by and meeting   everyone on our floor. i swear that the strangest thing, its the second   time I've switched the words our and hour, and not in the same way   either, very odd. tonights going to fun watching the football game, i   hope taylor enjoys himself tonight, it makes me so mad when hes   upset about social surroundings, oh well he'll learn. i guess i have   to get ready soon to go watch the game, i seem to always be   running behind, i'll catch up soon enough, i hope my package from   apple computer comes soon, im excited about my new adaptor silly   really to get excited but what the hey, might as well enjoy life 
__label__label1      Well it is about 0:00 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. I keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. I guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. I almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying   hey you should be studying something!   ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. The joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a   B   or   C   on a test rather than an   A  . I like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. So because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. Right now my grades are very important to me. I feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. Where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. My success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. Understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. You must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. Right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. So in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in Business. My happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 00 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. It makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. Ha. . what a character. Well no not really just a determined man. I like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. When i moved here from LOCNAME i had an agenda and for the last 0 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. It gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. Blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . Feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. I see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. Man i need to get some sleep. I took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   T  . Many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 0/00. Wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. Which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. The doctors say that she does not feel a thing. I really would like to believe them. It seems unfair that she should live this long (00 years) only to be let to die a little every day. The doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. I miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. Bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? It seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. Trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. I have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. Maybe that is part of this writing experiment. Have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. So when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. The mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. I read somewheres that in a thousand years the English language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. So they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. Hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the Egyptians. . times up. . night. 
__label__label1      It's 00:00 and my roommates still aren't up. Do I like them?  Do I hate them?  It's goes back and forth. I'm sure they have their good qualities, but damnit - it's 00:00. I am now feeling the sensation of eye drops in my eye, and dripping down my cheek. I have pink eye - who gets pink eye except little kids?  I guess I do. Thinking, what am I thinking. I am hoping I do not gain weight at college!  Last night was fun, it's nice to meet new people even though some of them were scary!  I can't believe that guy got beat up!  I hope I don't fail out of college in my first semester. Rumor has it, at LOCNAME they give you the first full year - then it's tough luck. We'll see. Maybe my homesickness will vanish before it majorly appears if I  m home after a year. Home - I hate home. No I don't, I love it. But some of the people I had to escape. PROPNAME, I thought I loved him!  He loved me!  What the hell happened?  Why won't he try to talk to me?  I'm not a bad person - or am I?  PROPNAME, I tell you - I just don't have a plesant history with the men. I need to brush my teeth. The Raisin Bran was really nice though - I can still taste it. It doesn't taste as good when the morning breath is mixing with the flavor of such sweet cereal. I wonder what my brother is doing. What my friends are doing, what my parents are doing!  I hope everyone is OK. I hope my parents are doing well. I hope they're adjusting to having no kids at home. I really miss them, they're the best. I have to do well here for them. I wonder if they'd let me move back in with them. I could do housework or yardwork for room and board - sure, they'd like that. No work for them, just plesant little PROPNAME home again. No, I'll do fine. It's up to me to do what I need to do. I wonder who's going to read this. I wonder what they'll think of me. I hope I don't have psychopathic tendencies!  That would be great - there's that girl PROPNAME, PSYCHO!  Haha, I wonder if that's what people think of me now. ISn't it funny you can go through life and never know what another person is thinking?  I mean, sure, you can say you know - but the bottom line is you never really will. That's so crazy. Most of the time I don't even know what I'm thinking!  Wow, this world is really crazy. This assignment is making me philosophical. I kind of like it. Do I sound like a genius?  Oh, IMs are popping up. How nice it is to be able to speak to people over the internet. It's kind of sad though. I'd much rather talk on the phone - or would I?  I suppose it, like everything, has it's ups and downs. I wonder what PROPNAME is  doing now. If he's met a new girl. Or even if he's hooking up with my friends. Or should I say,   friends  . Craziness. You think you know a person. What am I talking about?  I knew him for four days. But he'd never had a history of being an ass. I wonder what'll happen when I go home. WIll anything?  Everything happens for a reason. I'll just keep believing that. I wonder what tests I'll get into for this class. I'm interested in the experiments. Hmmm. I am tired. I can't smell a damn thing. Or can I?  That smell of nothingness. Is that even something?  It has to be, otherwise it wouldn't be there. Yes, I am smelling nothingness. It's not too bad. It would be awesome if nothingness had a wonderful smell, like cherries, or fruit. But then I wouldn't appreciate the smell of those things otherwise, so I suppose nothingness is better. Wow, PROPNAME was smart. He had it all planned out. I wonder if he's watching me now. I hope I'm not disappointing him. Sometimes I think I'm a disappointment. But, I'm not so bad I guess. My roommates are still sleeping. Who are these people?  Am I a bitch?  I can't help it - they're nothing like me. NOt that that's bad, but we share nothing in common. I wonder if they hate me. That would be funny. Another story to tell the kids. Crazy PROPNAME and the roommates that hated her. I am so weird. I am so tired. I will go to the gym. I will lose weight so I will go home and be sexy and hot. No, I'm not doing it to go home, I'm doing it for me. I want to be confident. I wonder what it's like to be confident. My stomach is grumbling. Wow, along with smelling nothing, I am hearing nothing. Well, that's not true - aside from the clicking of the keyboard I am hearing something similiar to silence. Even though it's not silence - there are faint sounds of insects shirping and doing their things, but it's close to silence. Or is it?  I don't think I've ever heard, or experienced silence. You can't hear silence can you?  If a tree falls and no ones around to hear it, does it make a sound?  How the hell am I supposed to know?!  I would like to sit down and have a little chat with God one of these days. Maybe I should go to church more often. Well, maybe I should go to church period. But I've been before and it never answered my questions. It just made me wake up earlier. I used to be scared of Church. I think I was 00 years old and questioning my existence - is that healthy?  I know it made me different. Wow, I am an interesting person. I'm so suprised that I've typed to this extent. I hope all goes well and I get credit. I really like this psychology stuff. 000 people in a class - that's crazy. And I know no one. I will meet people. I can't imagine standing and talking in front of 000 people for an hour and a half. Jesus. I don't know if I could stand up for an hour and a half let alone talk that long. 00 seconds. That's all I have. Well, God Bless LOCNAME. God Speed. 
__label__label0 well it's 00 min. into my writing and somehow i erased everything that i had. sorry. anyhow where was i.  I wonder if i should stop hanging around with sisters this semester. That would be really hard I don't think i could do it. I need to be around them. I wonder who i like the most right now. Is it abby? PROPNAME? still caroline?  I wonder if abby would ever hang out with me like one on one. I'm pretty sure yobel would, but she's so young. It doesn't matter to me really but to other people it's such a big deal. I wish all that stuff i had written hadn't of disappeared. what did i do to make that happen?  now the reader's going to think i was goofing off while i should've been writing and made the whole disappearing thing up. i wonder if it'll let me go on for more that 00 minutes. why would it have a fishish button if you were supposed to write for the entire 00 minutes. do some people write shorter. I want to find out but i don't want to push the button cause i may not be able to go back. I wish i had't burned my tongue yesterday. I hate it when i burn my tongue. I wonder where yobel is. I'm starting to get if for her i'm afraid. And when i get it i get it bad. can't i just go one semester without liking somebody?  time's almost up. well i guess i'll contunue writing a little longer since my first part got erased. how did yobel's legs get so muscular. They're awesome. I like the way they make her walk. I wonder if i should've sat by her on the bus today. We could've talked for twice as long. I'm glad i waited for her afer i got off the bus. It probably hinted to her that i like her though. nobody else knows that. should i keep it that way. can i keep it that way?  i hope so. It was horrible last semester with caroline. everybody knew. I hate that. i got to keep this one in my head. in my heart. Maybe i can teach her volleyball and she could teach me soccer. she seemed pretty impressed when i told her about my volleyball class. I wonder if she likes me. Maybe she thinks i'm too old. I don't look old though. I bet peter hogan looks older than me, and he's just a year older than yobel. If anything happens that wouldn't be too much of a problem. I wonder hwere peter hongan is now. why did he disappenar after he got his breakfast?  well if i'm not going bowling i guess i can spend money on breakfast. I wonder who will be there in the cba . i wonder if yobel is there right now. i guess i swing by and see. I'm sure i'll see somebody there anyhow 
__label__label0      Well, let me see, i have a lot of stuff to do. got to write this, then i got to go to the soccer meeting, then i have to try and figure out stuff for the plane tomorrow. Im kind of hungry, not really but kind of. Man, i want some chicken strips. i want the light to be turned on. My friend here is playing a cool computer game having to do with terrorists and stuff, he just told me he was doing awesome on it. . Were waiting for PROPNAME, she should be here soon hopefully. I don't know whether i should go out or stay for the intrasmural soccer meeting . . hmm, im going to try and see if anything important is going to be said at this meeting. I also have to take a shower. . It's funny how college life is, its like real life, dependent, you have to be self-disciplined which is hard. College is actually a challenge, it is hard to stay focused on books when you have so many parties and activities to go to, and people to talk to. 00-0, thats pretty good. PROPNAME's getting good at that game. . . my friend's calling me . . ahh distracted. kind of cold, hmm wait, no its good actually. I don't know what to write for this. This is pretty hard. . 00 minutes passed already. . im going to dallas tomorrow, yay! happy. i love austin but i also love going back home. Eat meat and good food. Going to a ORGNAME game on sunday. . i wonder if they'll be any good this year, i don't think so. ORGNAME football now thats something else. Man, too bad i donmt have the sports package, damn. I feel like having Skittles but im too lazy to go get them downstairs. . :) yea im hungry definitely. Wish rachel would get here already. man, 0 min left to write cool. can't wait til im done with this assignment. . so that i can go already. Oh, so its stream of 'consciousness', i kept on saying 'stream of conscious' thinking that was the right thing to say. . man, dumb hahaha. Typing is actually fun. kind of tiring at the end though. . hmm 00 sec left! ok this is it, fun stuff now ha! yea 0, 0,0  
__label__label0      My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 0 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. 
__label__label1      I just got home from my boyfriends house. He is so wonderful. We have so much in common. I love him so much. He is a Christian and so am I. When we spend time together i feel like i am on top of the world just as happy as could be. That is how i am feeling right now that is why i am writing about him. I think about him all the time. When we are not together i wish we were. i can never be without him and not be missing him. He is just so funny, hes so cute, hes so wonderful. I wish he were here with me right now. He is caring and loving and we have a great time when we are together from when we are kissing to hugging to playing board games with his family. When i came home from his house i was going to try to send a card to my friend for his birthday, but when i was looking online for cards to send i was beginning to get frustrated that i could not find any that i liked so i started looking at other cards like pictures of cute babies that people had sent. I love to be around children and they seem to like me too. I hope to have some of my own one day. but that will be after college. I want to wait til I am married, that is very important to me. Even though sometimes i have to admit it is not easy. Me and my boyfriend have talked about getting married one day. I really wish he was here right now. but hes at the store with his mom shopping because she does not feel very well right now. I love his family so much. His parents are 0 of the most awesome christian people and the cutest couple you will ever meet. If me and my boyfreind do get married i want to be just like them. They have been married like 00 something years and are still completely in love with eachother like they had just started thier relationship togehter. YOu can see in in how they look at eachother how they talk to eachother just eerything about them. PROPNAMEs sisters are amazing too. They are truely a lot of fun.  They are 00 and almost 00 years old. So they are quite a bit older than he is. Whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that. I think they think we will get married some day too. I hope we do. When i first started dating him even within the first couple of weeks I could already sit in his house and picture bringing the kids over to the grandparents house. His parents would make awesome grandparents too. They are also really good with kids. His sisters would be really fun aunts too. His middle sister PROPNAME is getting married in december or january when her fiance gets back from LOCNAME with the VISA. Hes really cool too. I just got really happy because my boyfreind just sent me a message saying he was home but i had to say be right back so i could write more about him. He is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. Another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. It really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to God who is number 0 in our relationship. My Christianity is really important to me. I was raisedin a Christian home and brought up in church. I am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. They are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. Me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. We have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. She even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when I started dating David and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that   she had a good feeling about this one.  meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. And so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. I am glad that i still live at home while i am going to UT because I don't know where i would be without her. I am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever. The good thing about living at home besides free food an laundry is that my boyfriend also lives at home with his parents and he only lives like 0 minutes or less from me.

__label__label1 Well im listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME , what do you think he means by that line lucy loves thisd song she really loved it when i placed i love that part it is so pretty but now i wish hed just end the song wow thisd assignment is goofy i just really want to sleep sleep my head hurts i wondser if this is just me being crazy the medicine shouldn't work that fast should it, am i doing this right, i jusd misspelled right but thats kind of funny because thats what im supposed to do, write. I really wish I wasnt this sad, I left class early today just because i want to be bymyself, i hope they clap that much for me at LOCNAME, what to write next PROPNAME loved this song a lot too, this was our song, whatever she was crazy, that the name of the song, i love the song though , she didn't really love me or she would have shown it. i want a beer right now but all i can drink is water or else ill get really sick, should i be caring about typos I don't think i should be i can't help it, i want to correct them someone knocks PROPNAME wants to chill, but I tell i loved this part am i rightside up or upside down. Am i upside down. PROPNAME PROPNAME, go timmy, wow he's really good at guitar. ian really threw me off i don't know where i was thinking a PROPNAME she did love this song. We had good times with her and we got together on Sept 00 that day brought us together and i said that i worried soooooooo beautiful just another mistake we'll beat bback this pain and ill beat back this pain and ill be me ill be jsut me and it won't matter about friends or college or lax or fraternity i would give you back? what does that mean? Well i just don't know i looked at the clock , i think will weaver is coming back in so many Wills my brother PROPNAME and my roomate too many we should kiull a few. accoustic i want my guitar to sound like that. whats my favorite drink probably vodka with orange juice, crazy, whats crazy PROPNAME is crazy and he can make me smile but now the national anthem plays from somewhere and i can't help but think about the day and the laughter outside in the hall, i htink will is back in the hall with the neighbor PROPNAME and i wonder is this country completely fucked or is just some fucked individuals in chargfe or are we all just stuck in the fucked up circle since the day we were born and i just typed nad instead of and and i smiled again. But now im thinking about thinking and thinking about thinking about thinking, will got mad about me not getting the wristband and i really don't care about the wristband but i wish he wasnt mad, i wish that we would get along better, we need more friends, i think b ecause i love this song so much i sing it lower i hope i feel like this tonight when i see lucy, she can either make me feel incredible like the high life and then others she can make me feel awful just because i want her so bad, but she doesn't mean bad because if she did i would havec nothing to do with her, the typos annoy me so much because i fix some and other i dont. Im feeling better just typing but i felt like death this afternoon. Its kind of scary because the medicine has a warning about suicide attempts i really hope thats not me and it just the placebo that im feeling now,  i actually getting sick of typing now i want to lay down and play guitar and think about what im going to do but that would make me depressed again. I think i will have a beer though, then i will have some water. that will even out i hope, will came in he seems cranky still but i don't give a fuck he's being a dick about the whole thing i offered him a place to stay in LOCNAME and he was completely ungrateful, but whatever, i just looked at the time and thought i was done because i saw the 00 min at the top but really im 00 away im typing what i thought and not what im thinking will in the hall i wish he would just chill out hes so fuckin pissy right now still whatever i wish it was 0 then i would be with lucy i glad she dropped that class now i might get to see her, she doesnt much care for the 000 stuff, i wish that light would stop blinking because i can't reallyk answer right now but it just down there blinking blue then grey is it blinking grey or blinking blue i don't know which its so messed up to think of stuff like that, like when you look at your own name long enough it begins to look like a shape or something Srv so fuckin good the crowd seems to like him too john mayer liked him and played PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is so different but so good but i just want to play baseball right now. im done with this i think now im going to talk to nat now

__label__label1      I cannot wait to go and see PROPNAME this weekend. Nanny is coming into town; I love that woman. She is a great person, an amazing person. It has been awhile since I have seen her. I wouldn't mind not going to the ORGNAME game. It would be SO nice to have this place to myself without anyone else ere for a weekend. even if there ws nothing to do. I could catch up on  reading and homework or get ahead. But then again PROPNAME said that most people would die to go to the OU game and that I should accept the offers I receive. I rejected the first. The second one is someone who I just met last night. and I want to attend the game and this is the best way because tickets are so hard to get. But I have to stay in a hotel room with this guy. I guess I will just say I have a boyfriend. Speaking of. I like LOCNAME. He is very nice looking, very polite. He did everything right. I wonder if he likes me? I wonder if he will call today. only time will tell. I hate PROPNAME for what he did to me. No I hate what he did, I don't hate him. I don't hate anybody. PROPNAME and PROPNAME have become two of my best friends. I talk to each of them several times a day. The weird thing is, they have been friends for 0 years. And now, over some guy, PROPNAME hates PROPNAME. PROPNAME has done the same thing to me that PROPNAME has done to Emily. I do not really feel sorry for her. It feels weird that although they do not speak to each other, I speak to each of them many times each day and usually the other is not mentioned, and I dare not bring up the other, I do not want to stir things up or be in the middle of it. So I am going to see PROPNAME this weekend when I visit Emily. I know he will want me to stay the night with him. But so will Emily. I wonder if she would care. I don't want to do anything with him. It is just hard to put out old flames. We cannot start anything again. I just got a computer a few days ago and now it is not working! I am taking it home tonight to have someone work on it. PROPNAME is always in our dorm room. Last night everyone and their dog were in my dorm. I have 0 AM class Mon through thursday. I could not get to sleep until 0AM. Then I turned off the two larms I set and my neighbor called tomake sure I was up at around 0:00. Yikes. I hopped out of bed, brushed my teeth and ran out of my room. I want to see a movie. That is what I feel like doing today. right now. Maybe a nice sappy movie with lots of sweet romance-not corny though. Or a thriller or scary movie. but I only like to see that with a guy. Hmm. Or one with PROPNAME PROPNAME. Now PROPNAME is definitely not usually my type, but after seeing Fast and the Furious and XXX, he definitely does it for me. He has such a sexy voive and attitude. Usually I do not like guys that built. I need someone more my size. He is the exception. All 00 year old boys are assholes. I have not founf the exception to that rule. I will not even give one the time of day or a chance. I don't have time for that. But I think PROPNAME has already been through his stage. I think this one is worse than the terrible two's. I need to call PROPNAME. But I am afraid to tell her something I did with PROPNAME. I do not want her to pray for me or look down upon me. No she won't look down for me, but her heart will heart for me. But I am not really in the wrong direction. I pray. I know what is right and wrong. But no one is perfect. I also need to call my sister-I wonder how LOCNAME and PROPNAME are doing. Those kids are absolutely rotten. I hope they grow out of it. It is just that they are beautiful and PROPNAME is so cute that nobody ever can remain angry with her. I hope that they are beautiful in high school and i know they will be-not just because they are my nephew and neice, their mother is beautiful. But I hope that they are not the snobby kids. or the rude kids. I hope they are humble and compassionate. High school kids do too much damage to other high school kids. It's awful. I wish that highschoolers could lern to look at things on the grand scale. I wish they could think more term and not so much about the situation. Realize that it doesn't matter in callege. No one knows nything about you. It is a new start.  
__label__label0 Thins are so different. THere are so many people everywhere. I knew that 00000 people went to this school but i did not realize the implications of having to walk around on campus with every single on of them. I was way excited to move to LOCNAME, I mean. I came from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss my friends, I miss the parties, I miss 'drive-bys' and TJs and the movies. I miss Twister and Busdriver and Presidents and Assholes. I got in the hugest fight with my best friend in the entire world. It just seems to me like there are some things that just shouldnt be said. You say things in confidence and expect them to remain in confidence. I only told her because I felt obligated because shes my best friend. its the kind of thing you're supposed to tell a best friend. I never imagined in a thousand years that it would get to everybody and their dog in less than a day. She has never betrayed me like that before. I wonder why she did now. I want to leave this room, but everybody is out. in class or at some meeting or something. I've adjusted much better than I thought I would. Maybe because I was prepared to move on. I miss my friends, but all of us realize that the past was in the past. althought its going to be a helluva party come Homecoming. Thats another thing. I miss my dad, the funny man, the journalist who used words like helluva in his articles. I should miss my mom, I think, but I miss my dad more. quite a bit more. I guess because he never failed me. Aw and my dogs. PROPNAME is so adorable, hes probably lost without me. Man, I can just imagine how pathetic that sounds. 0th Street! A whole bunch of us are going to 0th street tomorrow night. I have no idea what to wear. PROPNAME all worried about what I wear. hey, he's in LOCNAME LOCNAME, theres no way he can tell me what to wear. not that i really let him before. hes just not here to watch over me and other guys anymore. Anyway. off to 0th street. I love 0th street. I could just stand there and look at people for hours. People crack me up. We took a picture with PROPNAME the transvestite the last time we were there. My dad loved it, he'd actually heard of PROPNAME, the mayoral candidate. I think I got lucky as far as roommates go. Man, my friend ( you know, the one who betrayed me) got the roommate from hell. They go to ORGNAME, and this girl is so rich. The only problem is that she knows it;  I have never seen a more overbearing, holier than thou attitude. I told her I went to ORGNAME and she goes ''Ugh, public schools  . I just about smacked her. I guess the only reason I didnt was because I didnt want to make things awkward for PROPNAME. even if she has gone and made things awkward for me. I think its funny how everyone at first sticks to their own gender. All the girls sit with girls and all the guys sit with guys. I love the girls I've met here, but i think its high time i meet some guys. Im sure PROPNAME would love that. Hes not my boyfriend, though. As my roommate PROPNAME puts it, he's my   significant other  , whatever that means. We really need to go grocery shopping, but both of our cars are in the middle of nowhere (aka. . the other side of hell. I00). It is such a hassle to get to our cars. I think we'd both just as soon starve. As soon as I can get PROPNAME up here, hes taking us shopping. At least he's good for something. I don't think I've ever been so tired in my life. I think its because my sleeping schedule is so irregular. I'll sleep 0 or 0 hours one night and 0 the next. And weekends. man, forget it. Im lucky if I get any sleep at all. Im trying to make the transition with people. You know, that transition between just sitting next to each other in class to hanging out outside of class. Its a little rougher than Id planned. Im just kind of shy, I guess. I have a problem just asking them to hang out. kind of weird. I sat by this incredibly weird guy today in class. He noticed the strangest things about people. He wanted to exchange numbers and such to get up a study group, but we both forgot by the end of class. I can't decide if thats a good thing or not. seems like he would get kind of annoying after a certain amount of time. Oh. . I need to get my printer hooked up. There are so many computer literate guy geniuses I live with that I could ask. cuz I think Im missing some part or something. That doesnt really make any sense because its a brand new printer in a brand new box. What are the chances of my box being the one missing a part? How depressing would that be? Thats just an extra hassle that I don't need. Everything around here is computerized anyway. one of these days Im going to have to print something. Might as well take advantage of these computer geniuses. Ok, watching the clock. . yep.     
__label__label0     Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 0th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 00 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 0 0/0 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 00-00 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. 
__label__label0 I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 0 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in LOCNAME and I've already been to the LOCNAME mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think LOCNAME has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a ORGNAME is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to LOCNAME I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at LOCNAME. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   
__label__label1      So today has completed a very odd and trying week. I have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and WOW!!! I seem to find myself asking, have I over done myself? I am taking 00 hours of scool and working 00-00 hours a week and on top of all this I got TWO kittens that require a lot of attention. This, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work I have to make sure I am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but I love them. My roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like I am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? I am not trying to say I don't take their words into consideration but I believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he/she learns. This is a test for me that I hope I don't fail at but all I keep telling myself is that I must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). I am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. She found out a month ago that she had 0rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. The doctor said she should be alright but I still worry. I really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. All I can conclude is that I have been set a full plate that I now must eat. Besides all the drama I just mentioned I have finnaly declared my major as Child Development/ Pre-Med with a minor in psychology. THis is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which I am very thankful for. I know it will be A LOT of work but I love working with children, but now whether I follow all the way through with Pre- Med is a different story but I know eventually I will get through it and go to Med-School. For right now I need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. Another thing I am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that I could have gotten two tickets the the OU game and I passed up the opportunity. There goes a couple hundred dollars I coould have gotten off ebay. Oh well, that's the way life goes. By the way, my boyfriend of three years, PROPNAME, Took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. We had 00 courses in 0 0/0 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(0 bottles of champaign ahd 00 glasses of assorted wine later). The cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $00 =). Anyhoot I enjoyed writting and I will see you next time, bye.   
__label__label1      I FEEL REALLY TIRED NOW. I JUST COMPLETED MY PRE TESTING NOW,. THE TIME IS SO LATE NOW, I WONDER IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK TODAY. THERE IS NOBODY IN THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY. I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A HEADACHE. I HAVE SO MANY STUDYING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. I HAVE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK TO DEAL WITH, MY CALCULUS 0 HOMEWORK TO WORK OUT, MY BIOCHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO. GEES THAT SOUDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT TO DO. TODAY HAS BEING HELL FOR ME. TO START OFF, I LOST MY CREDIT CARD. I WISH I WAS AT HOME RIGHT NOW. I COULD WEAR I SMELL SOETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I WONDER WHAT MY SISTERS ARE DOING NOW. I AM SURE THEY WANT ME HOME. BHUT I HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE STUDYING. I HAVE TO DO EXCELLENTLY WELL THIS SEMESTER, TO BRING UP MY GPA AVERAGE. SO FAR I THINK MY CALCULUS CLASS IS GOING ON FINE. My PHYSICS CLASS IS ALSO GOING ON FINE. I WONDER HOW MY LAB WOULD BE LIKE. I HOPE I DO VERY WELL IN THE CLASS. I JUST HAVE FAITH THAT THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I KNOW IT IS. I AM GOING TO TRY AND DO MY BEST. I NEED A GIRL IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER GET A GIRL, WHEN I AM JUST TO PICKY. WHY NOSA WHY?I JUST CAN HELP THE WAY I FEEL. I MEAN IT IS ME, I CAN'T HELP IT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL, NOT A SUPERFICIAL GIRL, NOT A FAKE GIRL, A REAL, BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY GIRL. SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, SOMEBODY THAT COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM. SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MORE THANANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SOMEONE THAT WOULD DIE FOR ME. SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GROW OLD WITH ME AND STILL LOVE ME THEN. IF I COULD JUST FIND THAT SPECIAL PERSON, I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN OF ALL. IS IT TOO MUSH TO ASK FOR. I MEAN I AM A GOOG LOOKING GUY AND QUITE A NICE GUY TOO. WHAT MORE COULD A WOMAN NEED. I AM SWEET. SWEET AS AN APPLE PIE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR ME. MY SOUL IS SEARCHING TO FIND YOU. I JUST HOPE HER SOUL IS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WELL BACK TO REALITY. STUDYING. I GOT TO GO STUDY. I FEEL HUNGRY AND SLEEPY. 
__label__label0      Hello. I'm not quite sure what to think about this. I love to write, but I write in such a way that I can always go back and correct it. it's almost like I find myself having to check everything I do a million times because I never like it the first time. So to sit here and write for 00 minutes, knowing that it has to be continuously. . that's almost too much. And another thing. I don't really like not having a topic. I find it's not kind organized, and I'm not sure where to take the topic. Maybe I'm afraid of what I'll say the first time around, which could be interpretted to me that I'm afraid of my true feelings, but I think when I type that, everyone will think I'm only saying that because this is psychology. That's not true. I supress everything. Everything. I don't think anyone knows the real me, because I've never really let anyone in. I would love to, however. if I ever felt like they truly wanted to be let in, but as it stands, none of it matters. Man, I am sounding like a real nut. This is not cool. I am crazy, I think. And now, my mind is thinking about the cowboys game I was watching before this. It was in the 0th and it was going nothing but downhill for 'em. I like the ORGNAME a lot, and I hope they win, but school is important, and besides, I couldn't watch them lose like that anymore. Boo to football. Boo to losing. It all sucks. And now, with that wonderful segway, I guess I could talk about other things. things not so trivial. Man, 00 minutes is a long time. I wonder if any of this will make sense, if it can even be read on a scale or whatever it will do when I click finish. Man, I wish I could click finish right now. No such luck. No such luck. No such thing. Isn't that the name of the song that PROPNAME PROPNAME sings?  He sucks because he's going out with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I like PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME a lot and I like typing her name because it's so long that it passes the time. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. . and that makes me out to be a freak too. . how many times can I type her name. isn't that a waste of time. isn't cheating?  Why am I talking this way?  You know, I want to get a poster of PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME for my bathroom. I've never really put up posters. But now that I have my own apartment bedroom, I think I should. It's a good expression of me, but I wonder what everyone who enters my bathroom will think. Will they think I'm this big horny toad who likes having her in my bathroom? Well, not having her, but you know. Speaking of which, I need a girlfriend!  My shower curtain is so clear, and the mirror is right across the bathroom. It's kind of weird washing my hair to look over and see myself. washing my hair. Imagine the possibilities. Now, if I had that poster of PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I could look out and stare at her. Only, it wouldn't really be her. I don't know what I'm talking about. I bet if I start talking about girls I actually know, when I click finish, I'll find out a lot of stuff. Which brings me to this girl I like. I don't understand how I can have so much with her. No, wait. I take that back. What I really don't understand is how a girl can have so much fun with me, and be so comfortable around me, and still not want to go out. I feel like the girl of the friendship. I want the serious relationship, and she doesn't want to be tied down. What is tied down?  Why look at something so negatively. I mean, if you're happy with someone, why should you obsess over what might tempt you in the future. Planning out your future is one thing, but planning to stray or be attracted to someone else is quite another. I've been told I'm too young to love right now anyway, and I should wait, but I don't think anything changes. I mean, I know myself too well. and I know that I would be so happy to be in a relationship that everything else would subside; it wouldn't matter. Happiness isn't easy to come by, and I would hold on to it like nothing I've ever held on to before. So, yeah, I just. I'm just so confused about everything. I've never been in a serious relationship, and I've been told that's why I want one so much. I don't know. It's kind of like. of course it's what I want. We want what we can't have. That makes me feel even worse, but old sayings like that are around for a reason. I just. wish I had something to offer that could win her over. Something, besides everything else I offer to her, to make her see that it's all worth it. That she shouldn't worry about the future, because I will take care of everything. Of course, thinking about it like that, I have to totally become unbiased: if she is not wanting to go out with me, because she doesn't want to be tied down, then she is planning on going out with several guys in the meantime. I guess you could say that means I'm saving myself a lot of heartache, but it also means that even though she's planning this multitude of guys over the next few years, she still won't choose me. I'm still just a friend. I know guys hate that. I used to tell my friends that were in the same situation that   being friends was great. You still have the girl as a friend. So what if you can't go out?  You can still hang out, and you can still talk.   Well, then I actually found myself in their shoes, and I understand. It's so much clearer. From the outside, it looks good. When you get there, not only does it feel gut-wrenching, it also feels like everyone on the outside is laughing at you, like they can't understand any of it. And I don't understand that, but it's like, you're screwed even though you know better. I knew better. I know I lose a friendship that is extremely important. and maybe it's a risk that I shouldn't take. I say that because I can't take it; otherwise, I would have already, and I would probably be somewhere crying right now. Not that I cry. Not that that's bad. I just. always find a way to hide my emotion, which may be part of my problem. I'm not crazy. I just. I'm a big fan of fate. I think what's meant to be is exactly that, so if this girl and I are meant to be then we will be. And if not, I'll just sit around and wonder why. 0 seconds. By the way, PROPNAME PROPNAME is a cool singer. Just sucks he's going out with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME!  The End. I went over. Wow that was fast. Bye. 
__label__label0      My mind is blank right now. I'm doing this late so i'm nervous that it won't count for credit. i went swimming today, but i wish i hadn't because then this would be on time. sometimes i get homesick, i called my mom today and she was talking about my cousin's wedding. she was surprised that i was willing to pay for my plane ticket there. i think i would regret it if  i didn't go. i've never been to boston before. i hear that it's very historical. I guess they have good clam chowder there, that's what people say. I like clam chowder, but i've only had the kind that comes in a can, so i guess i haven't had real clam chowder. i like a lot of foods from a can. people laugh at me because i still like spaghetti-o's. oh well. they laugh at a lot of things I eat. I really hope this counts for credit. It's only an hour late. I can't believe I forgot, I'm usually so good with homework. If it doesn't count, at least i can still try to get good grades on everything else and maybe i can still get an A. i have to try really hard, i guess even harder now that i realize i am forgetting things, but i want to go to graduate school to get my Ph. D. in psychology. so hopefully i'll start remembering to do all my homework. i've been pretty good with keeping up with the reading in all my classes, but it's a lot of reading. i knew college would be a lot more work than high school, but i never imagined all the reading. i'm actually enjoying this writing assignment, i haven't written in a journal or anything in a long time. it feels good to get things out. i used to write poetry too. that made me feel a lot better when i was sad. usually it had to do with guys. they always find a way to make me feel bad. it felt good to be able to turn something bad into something good. i should get back into writing poetry, maybe someday it'll actually be good. i only let a couple people read it and they said they were good, but you never know if they're just saying that or not. i like a couple of them but i usually eventually decide that they're not very good after a while. my two favorite ones are lost somewhere. that really upsets me. i wrote them on a plane. i know i didn't lose them on the plane but when i packed to move here, i still couldn't find them. i wrote them in a spiral but i have a lot of half used spirals. i hope nobody took it. i don't like it when people read my poems. only if i show them and even then it's hard. i don't know why, i  guess it's because they're so personal, it's like i'm completely open and vulnerable when people read my poems. they read my most personal thoughts when they read them. except for a few, some thoughts i just don't put on paper. some things that i'm really not proud of would really not be best on paper because then i'd have to look at them again, or someone else could read it. my parents go through my sister's stuff sometimes, so i assume that they go through mine too. i hope the don't find the pictures from the party at my house. i forgot to bring those and they would probably cut me off if they knew i had a party there. it was fun though. that was the best party. everyone said so, so i know it wasn't just me who had fun. people were dancing and everything and everyone was getting along, usually somebody gets in a fight at parties. boys are so stupid. wouldn't that be a funny last sentence? that seems to be a pretty good conclusion though. it always seems to come around to that. 
__label__label0 Well, I don't really know what I am suppose to be doing, so I'll just do the best that I can. I have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind right now. I feel nervous, yet excited to find what college life has yet to bring me. I feel that I need to manage my time more, because I am so scared that everything is going to catch up with me. All weekend I've said that I need to do something, but just can't seem to figure out What I should do. I talk to my mom everyday, and it makes me really sad. Everyday I think of my family and how much I miss them. We are so close and my nieces and nephews mean the world to me, and everytime I talk to them on the phone it makes me cry. I even felt like just leaving, but I know that I have to stay here in order to succeed. My boyfriend doesn't really help out much in making me feel better. He just doesn't understand how it feels to actually miss family. He gets so mad at me just because I call her and he says by me doing that it doesn't make things any better. It's just that she is so sad because I am not there and she's all alone. She thinks that I won't ever come home again, and I know that's not true. I just wish there was a way for me to let her know that. She thinks that just because I left I won't ever see her again. I know that I will never move back home after I graduate, but it will always be home, and I know I will visit her. I also feel so pressured, in soo many ways. I just worry that I won't make it here. I just want it to all end soon. I want to finish school as quickly as possible, because I feel that I need to begin my life. I mean not begin my life, but actually start my own. I need to get out and see the real world on my own perspective. My mom has held this shield over me my whole life, so being here has opened my eyes a whole lot. I've learned so much, but know that I have so much more to see. I really wish I could experience more things though. I mean having a boyfriend holds me back a lot. I haven't gotten to experience all the things that I should.   Sorry I don't know if this is going to work, but I realized I didn't put in my social or name. 000000000- PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label1      Right now i am in my dorm room recovering from classes and preparing for an evening filled mostly with studying. My ears are receiving the wonderful sounds of PROPNAME PROPNAME, Jackopierce & PROPNAME PROPNAME, and also PROPNAME PROPNAME ( a Camp Allen classic). I can not say that i am smelling anything particularly because my sinuses are acting up after a game of soccer last night. I guess there is just something about the grass down by the ORGNAME fountains that fires up my histamines.         I am feeling a little anxious and stressed right now. I woke up at 00:00 this morning just as my first class was starting. This class is small and very much attendance based, so i could not simply skip it. I had to rush out the door and i believe that this rush has caused me to feel as though in race all day. The stress comes from the inability to finish a project for that class as a result of my oversleeping. I know the professor was not proud and i am afraid my grade will suffer as a result. I want to keep my grades up so that i will be able to easily transfer to any school because right now i do not believe that i will be able to cut it for 0 years in architecture school. For now i am committed to finishing this semester and evaluating things from there.         My mind just wandered back to Psychology class today. Dr. PROPNAME really angered me when he suggested that one of the greatest christians of all time and that spirituality and religion are all frauds and conjured up by our temporal lobes. He said that PROPNAME saw a vision of Christ after he fell on the road to damascus because he probably hit or damaged his temporal lobe. Well PROPNAME saw a blinding light that caused him to fall and afterward he was blind, which would not be caused by damage to the temporal lobe. Furthermore, other people had received visions of what was to happen and to receive PROPNAME into their homes as a result of the events. There i've said my piece.         I just realized that the music i'm listening to makes me miss my friends. One is called   Please Come to LOCNAME   and it talks about trying get together with old friends as this person is moving on with their own life. It has the same effect on me. I want my friends to come visit me on campus, but for some reason it would feel like a step back for me to go visit them. The other song is one from the christian summer camp i worked at for the past three summers. it just takes me back there with all of my friends and the summer love. We still talk occasionally, but only over the internet and not on the phone. I really prefer talking face to face if at all possible and then the phone and lastly the internet. It just seems so impersonal to talk on the internet with instant messages. Plus you can not fully express yourself; sarcasm for example is hard to decipher when written.         Wow, i actually wrote for twenty minutes and enjoyed it. this was actually a little therapeutic to express myself like this. 
__label__label1    i really want to lose weight, i want rob to look at me and want me. i wonder if he does?  he says he does, but i wonder if he really does because when i want to be with him, he acts like hes got to do homework, or actually im not really that i don't know. he doesnt put me first i guess. id skip out on my homework to be with him. but i guess since hes a freshman, he doesnt know any better. however i am a junior, so he has to want me. this is a hard assignment because right now my mind is not wondering off of rob. i think about him quite often. hehe. . i wonder if he knows that. his hair. i love his hair. . his body, damn. junior boys do not have bodies like his. . whoa. . i have to take of my bracelets they are annoying me. i can't wait til im 00. i wish i could be laying out right now, but the pool is closed on mondays. i really want my hair to grow out. i have been growing it out for hmm. . . lets see. . years? no matter damnt. i have been trying to get it to get longer for so long, and it doesnt seem to be happening. its not like i cut it to my shoulders and then am like, okay, now im going to grow it out. its been this length for a while now. i need to relax. i have all this tensions in my arms and hands and its annoying me. i wonder if its cause im typing or if its just because im like that. i wish i had a dog here at school. i want a pet so bad, but not all the times. i wish i could have a pet when i want one, and then when i don't want to clean up the shit, it just disappears. i wonder if something else will happen soon with the terrorists. i wonder if the whole a-bomb thing is going to happen with sadam h. damnit, i guess im ready to die, but not really. i am just now getting into the swing of things of life. i am happy living alone, and i just want to do well in school. before all i cared about was my social life, but i suppose its obvious i don't care anymore about that because i have a thing for a freshman. i hate boys but i love them. i know i can get whomever i want for the most part, but everytime i let myself be all how i would like to be, i lose them. i wonder if i have done something wrong with the boy. i bet hes wondering if im crazy because im a junior. he always asks why im with him, or why i would even talk to him or hangout or whatever. but that was before. now its been a month and perhaps hes not interested anymore. oh why in the hell do i care?  there are so many guys out there. i am so boy crazy. i wonder if i am normal. maybe its because im a scorpio. i didnt believe in all that shinnanigans before, but i recently read something that said scorpios are more horny or more into relationships or the opposite sex or something. that is very true in my case. what you going to dooo. i go crazy on you. i go craaazzyy on youuu. . i love music. i wish i could write better poems so i could write songs. oh man now i have to pee. . i wonder what i did that turned him off. we used to be best friends. . i wonder if he thinks of me. probably, obviously not as much as i think about him otherwise he wouldnt have let things go to shit like he did. i hate MIS. i hate homework. i wish they could just plug into your brain something, like a computer, like a little chip, so that learning or anything would be effortless because the chip would offer all the knowledge we need on a certain subject. like if you wanted to be a doctor, you just get a surgeon chip installed, etc. i want to be an actress. it better happen. i wish my parents could be happy. they don't seem very happy. i love to laugh. i don't wnat to get old. self control, self control. i wonder what is going to happen to me. what constitutes a slut?  i know im not, i just kiss lots of boys, youre a slut if you sleep with all of them, and i don't do that. . . i hope i don't do that when im older. cause once you get started, its hard to stop. i wonder if shes doing coke?  id hate to be her. shes so insecure and so untrusting, i don't trust anyone, but she really doenst trust anyone. id hate to be bipolar. gosh, i feel so bad, but i wish i could shake her and be like, snap out of it!!!  quit it!  stop!  im getting hungry and i told myself i need to eat less, however, damnit, i would love to have some jalepano cheese rightnowww. . . yuummm. . i can't believe shes gettting married because shes pregnant. that sux. i would never do that. . well i can't say never because i have said id never do a lot of things that i do. i hate that. it makes me think i have no control overmyself whatsoever. i need to order some more zit medicine. 00, 00. . . i want to make a lot of money. 
__label__label1     This assignment is cool. It requires no outside tinking. I can just think about what I want to think about. Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to LOCNAME or something like that. But i like being back in LOCNAME. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in LOCNAME again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading PROPNAME PROPNAME or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to LOCNAME. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to PROPNAME last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to LOCNAME. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and i'm already in LOCNAME. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit LOCNAME's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope LOCNAME wins tonight and moves up in LOCNAME's rankings and ORGNAME state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope ORGNAME kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of LOCNAME in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. PROPNAME sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 00th. GO HORNS!!! 
__label__label1   right now I'm thinking about my poor roomates because one of them, PROPNAME, just found that her little sister woke up this morning to find a bullet hole in her window!  If her bed would've positioned different she would've been dead!  I'm also thinking about my other roomate, PROPNAME, she just found out that she didn't get the job that she wanted because she doesn't have time to go through training. I'm also kind of stressed because one of the reasons I came to this school is to do crew and now I'm nervous I'm not going to make the team, aghh. I also am stressed because I have a lot of homerwork to do right now such as reading for psychology and writing my english paper. It's also hard because I miss my family and wonder why I'm here, but then I think how I wouldn't be happier anywhere else. And then I'm wondering about who's going to be reading this and wondering if they think I'm a psycho and then I wonder, is anyone going to be reading this?  go figure. I'm also really excited to be here be because I hate the snow in LOCNAME (where I'm from) and am so excited not to  be cold here this winter. But I miss all my friends and hope they are happy where they are to. One of my best friends sisters said that in your first two weeks of college you change in ways more than you could ever fathom and you are such a different person the day you walk into your dorm and the day that you walk out. At college you have time to discover who you really are, and that is really cool you, or at least I, can discover who I am without the distractions of my family, my responsibilities, and my friends. In LOCNAME no one knows who I am so I can reinvent myself to be whatever way I like, I can take time to discover if I really like myself and if I don't I have four years to change myself into the person that I want to be, wow I really like that it sounds nice. I just hope that I meet all the people I can and I hope I can get some best friends, I also worry about money and the fact that I'm spending it and not making it. Sometimes I'm so stingy. I also worry about how my family is going to survive without me (I know that sounds selfish) but I do a lot of things such as being a peacemaker  between my sisters and cleaning up after my dog who isn't potty-trained and driving my sisters around and running errands for my parents, I'm sure they'll be fine I just in a way hope that they aren't so that they miss me. I hope that this writing piece doesn't seem self-centered because I'm just writing about myself. I just don't know what else to write about. I'm also listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME, I love her voice it is so awesome. oww my hands are sore I could never be a secretary.  My major is actually elementary ed with a minor in psychology. I'm really excited to be a teacher but sometimes I wonder how I can be so excited about it or if I'm setting feminism  back because I will be happy in such a traditional role. But hey whatever floats your boat right?  Sometimes I get so excited about the way I'm going to decorate my classroom and the curicullum I'm going to teach. I'm also very excited to take all the classes that are required for my major. They should all be very exciting and hopefully the professors will be enthusiastic because how could they not be they are training us to go into their profession. It's so exciting how college is the step before my real job my whole life I have been preparing for college and now I'm in college and preparing for my next step, my job.   
__label__label1    Okay i really do not know what to say frankly i have never done a writing assignment not knowing what the topic is or what ia m expected to write but all i know is that i have to write or type for the next twenty minutes which for me seems like it is fairly a small amount of time since i type really slow. Anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class, no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice. I love psych, i actually want to be an elementary counselor, i guess i choose this because my parents split up and i guess i want to help students or young kids to understand this whole mess. it really does not matter anymore although to be frank i wish things were the way the were before, not for me but for my younger sister she has suffered a lot from the desicion my parents made, well actually my mother, but who is to blame, I guess that is all in the past and i can't change that. well enough of that i am really glad that we can just type and type just letting our little heads just take us somewhere i reall appreciate this since i am not worried about how this will be graded i think i just have a little anxiety when it comes to papers, i guess i have to get into the idea that college is totally different form high school. i think my problem is that i know that everyone is expecting a lot from me since i am the first in the family to attend a big university, both in my dads family and in my immediate family. i am afraid of letting them down sometimes i really can't take it but i just know that everyone is behnd me i guess that motivates me and at the same time that kind of puts a bunch of pressure on my shoulders. i guess it is because my brother is or should be like a junior but i frankly think that he is just being a drain in the economy, i mean i probably saw him studying once in a whole semester and that was probably just cramming for his final exams. right now i really do not know whta ha plans on doing he just simply needs to get his act together not that i always do but at least i know that i won't hurt my parents the way he does. I guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin. She would just so die she would never think that i lied to her telling her that i would be living alone. i really feel guilty do not get me wrong but what can i do if she would have opened herself a little towards me then i would have probably told her, who am i trying to kid i guess that is just my excuse i have asked my mom several times already if she would let me get married and she said no, well she said wait at least two yeras i really do not knowhy i need to wait two years, she says that has nothing to do with my boyfriend which is true they get along real good i really do not know if it is that he speaks spanish or if it is the fact that he is real nice, oh did i mention that he gets paid really good. I do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad, i hope she understands a little. i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on. when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad, and i really do not want him to find out yet, you see my dad is depressed, the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier, and he says i am like his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already. i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do  not agree with the way i am living it. as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me, i hate when people say don't get married because then you won't go back to school i will prove all them wrong i will teach them, i know that you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it 
__label__label0 Wow I'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that I'm listening to some ORGNAME ORGNAME very loud as well as the LOCNAME LOCNAME / LOCNAME game in the background but what the hell why not. I was thinking about what the hell I was going to write about earlier and I guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness. Ha. Well anyway I probably should not stop writing. It's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body (especially your hands) because sometimes I will think of something and begin typing it and then I will forget what in the hell I was thinking about until it's too late. The same thing even happens in conversations, and that sucks a big fat hairy one when I'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing I was watching last night and then I will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth. Hmm it's very tempting to get lost in watching that clock in the upper portion of the screen. I keep seeing it tick away the seconds and it makes me want to look at it. I find all of this internet stuff veryu fascinating, especially since I am fairly proficient in it. Wow, this feels almost like an inner monologue because deep down in the back of my consciousness I know that I will be the only one reading it, so I get almost this pointless feeling to myself as to why in the world I am even putting forth any effort into doing such an assignment. Hmm that was the third time I have corrected my spelling. I wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment. Typing is such a weird thing. I do it so much that I feel fairly proficient, but I was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers. How does one get through life in any situation where he/she only types with two fingers. I just thought about what an ass I was last night. I was supposed to go to see PROPNAME PROPNAME with a fairly attractive, but fairly annoying and fairly commonly high girl a few floors up, but I felt really sick yesterday and the rain made me extremely lazy, so I told her in no uncertain terms that we probably wouldn't go to the concert even though that's all we had talked about the week before. I'm such a jackass / loser when it comes to relations with the ladies. I don't know what in the hell that last thing was, but oh well. Wow I wonder what a handful of other people I know here and at ORGNAME are doing at this exact second?  Hmm eight minutes and thirty seconds. The death knell tolls in the background. As does   Every Hungry Woman   off of the Allman Bros. ' first and self titles release. Wow, I will type anything to keep the flow going. The only other time I can think of stream of consciousness in my real world experience is a brief relation in   The Sixth Sense   when that little PROPNAME PROPNAME kid writes down every and any bad word imaginable and that terribly boring and lifeless novel I had to read in 0th grade called The Reivers. I can't think of the author right now, just because if I sat and thought I'd stop typing and that would defeat the whole purpose of this excercise. Hmm President PROPNAME is on TV right now. How sad it is that people criticize him constantly. What a load of hypocritical, cynical assholes. Wow, now I really feel like that little shit in the Sixth Sense as I constantly am using bad language. What a sad world I live in vocabularily (if that is even a word) if all I can do is cuss in a paper. I guess that's not all that I'm doing, but it is a lot of what I'm doing. Wow, that was a complete waste of a sentence. As was that one. And that one. Wow I could go on for hours like this. I don't think I have misspelled very many words so far. Wow, I deserve a cookie. What a sad statement. This paper is riddled with psychological buzz words and phrases. What a head-case am I. Ok, PROPNAME, enough. Speaking of Yoda, PROPNAME and Silent PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME was one funny, yet dissapointing movie. I don't know why I chose that one out of PROPNAME PROPNAME's entire repituare (that is most definately not spelled correctly), seeing as Mallrats, Chasing PROPNAME, and Clerks were fairly brilliant, and Dogma was exceptionally interesting although quite blasphemous, but I guess that's why I was so let down by J&SB Strike Back. It's funny how your mind jumps from one idea to another. I was just thinking about when I could go back home and see the folks. For some reason, I only get homesick and depressed when I am severly screwed up, which is possible, I guess, because I can see more clearly, I don't know. And by screwed up I don't mean on heroin or crack which some may need to believe. I'd never do that hard shit (I think the bad language is necessary there, eh?) Eh, what the hell am I, Canadian. Wait, no, canadian. I don't think they deserve a capital C. Well, they get a lot of flack for no reason. So I guess I can say Canadian. There, was that so hard. Yes. More inner monologue. Uggggh. 0. 0 minutes left. This is an exceptionally long feeling. I just got finished (before I started into this thing) reformatting and reinstalling Windows XP on my suitemate's laptop. I enjoy doing crap like that. Ever since I've been here it seems like there aren't very many computer proficient people like back in LOCNAME. Oh well. Time's almmost up. Yep, time she is a up. We'll delve into this more deeply next week (By the way, that was Something About PROPNAME. ). 
__label__label0 Wow, the person next door has their music up too loud, but now they turned it down. I can't wait until the party tonight. I'm not normally excited about parties, my foot hurts, I moved it. Well, I'm at 00 sec. Hmm. there comes the music again. I don't like that kind of music otherwise it wouldn't bother me. What does PROPNAME's computer say?  She was playing solitaire. My wrist itched and I scratched it. Is that how you spell scratched?  It doesn't look right. It's funny how simple words often don't seem like they're spelled right. Words like of. I could think of where the o key was, there I did it again. Two minutes and 00 sec. The green light on my router box is flashing. I guess, it's supposed to, though I would think a solid light would mean it was working right. I want to know who actually reads this kind of thing, or if it is read. It might be interesting, I suppose. I bet people write some pretty crazy stuff. I almost wrote shit there, but then realized that might be inappropriate, which is funny since I just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers. Particularly if they're crazy. I make my self laugh inside sometimes. Oh goodness, I'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper. I had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness. 0 minutes and 00 sec. Wow, this is going by pretty quickly. The scroll bar just started. My headphones are sitting next to my computer. I'd like to be listening to some music right now, but of course, not my neighbor's music. Maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME or Counting Crows, or Dave Matthews Band or I could get my new PROPNAME PROPNAME cd from my car. I really like every song on that cd. My dad called today. We haven't talked since I've been back here in LOCNAME. I remember last year we talked about every other night for a while. I guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart. I'm very close to my dad. Wow, I'm writing as if I'm talking to someone now, which I'm not. I should stop that. Hmmm. deep breath in and out. LOCNAME. I wish he was on-line, I'd really like him to come to the party tonight. It should be fun. PROPNAME will be there though, and he did say he might go to LOCNAME with me tomorrow. That's nice of him, but I guess, maybe he owes me because I did take him home at 0 in the morning last night (this morning). Wow, someone could find out all the crazy shit, there I said it, about someone's life by reading these writings. Writing, I haven't written in my journals in a long time. I have been writing some in the on-line diary though. so yeah. PROPNAME doesn't read it though. This is hard to not edit my thoughts. Every now and then, I think about something and then skip to something else, then realize I should be writing everything that comes into my head down. So, I am making a conscious effort not to edit, I had to look at the title of the page again to see how to spell that. I'm typically I good speller. Maybe it's the pressure of this writing assignment. 00min and 00 sec. Man, this semester, all my professors have really great websites for their classes. I'm so impressed. I wish I was good at creating web pages. Then I'd make one for myself, moved my feet situation again, and again, I'd let everyone know about my webpage and situating myself, I'd, scratched my eyebrow, I'd update my webpage every day. Scratch my ear. I don't know why I'm itching all the sudden, couldn't find the c key. Well, looked at ORGNAME's computer again. She has so many more people on her buddy list then I do. I have people on my buddy list that I don't even talk to when they're on-line. well, a number of the people on her buddy list on people from the PROPNAME PROPNAME message boards, I wanted to call them bulletin boards, but that's not what they're called. Anyway, scratching. tapping my foot. seeing that word tapping doesn't look like it's spelled correctly. Oh well. I guess this really isn't for a grade, so it doesn't matter if I spell things correctly and do our minds spell . correctly. I don't know. I'd like to be a part of the ta's studies with the tape recorder catching small glimpses into my conversations throughout the day (though I don't have fabulous conversations) or the study about people's relationships and why people stay together and why they don't. I mean, someone should do a study on PROPNAME and I,  I wouldn't necessarily call us dysfunctional, but I surely could be wrong in staying around for him for so long because yeah, he could treat me better, or pay me, scratching, more attention, scratching. I'm getting really uncomfortable, my neck and left arm is starting to cramp up, I haven't had to type this much in a long time. I guess, because I haven't had to write any kind of paper in quite some time. Well only less than 0 minutes left. This has been fun. I'm really uncomfortable. I'd like to read some other people's writings from our class. I am curious what you can tell about a person from something like this. Is is even accurate, because couldn't someone just create some elaborate/or un-elaborate story to put down here, or poetry or something. Hopefully, it doesn't sound like that's what I'm doing because I'm not. Now, I sound paranoid, oh goodness. well, nearly done. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0         
__label__label0 wow this page is not really what I was expecting. besides that ticking timer thing in the top is distracting me because I see it ticking. damn I tried to scroll down thinking I could move it out of my view to avoid distraction but it won't scroll. typing is annoying me. I can do it fairly well and fast without looking but I keep screwing up random letters and making typos and I'm tired of using backspace. well then. I just picked on my face and now it kinda hurts on my chin. I just looked and the timer and it already says 0 minutes. wow this is going faster than I thought. I actually thought I wouldn't mind this assignment too much because it seems kinda fun to just type whatever a persons thoughts are. plus its not a typical assignment. I love when assignments have time limits. my right arm hurts. its a bad setup for typing at my desk. all my computer and everything is diagonal so it can fit but its bad to type this way for long periods of time. I just had so much trouble typing the I" in periods for some reason. it was annoying me. wow 0 minutes. I keep having to adjust in my seat. not so comfortable and my legs are not feeling right. there's no good place to put them. and my underwear are riding into my ass. its really fucking annoying. ok I fixed it. well I thought so. ok I think that's better now. I just got a blank and for a second I was actually thinking about nothing. or it seemed to be nothing. is that even possible?  I don't think it is. I think probably someone is always thinking about something. maybe they just don't know what it is consciously or something. there's people screaming in the hallway. someone wants to get into a room or something. man this is kinda frustrating because I keep feeling like I'm trying to actually say things worthwhile and then when I start talking about what I'm thinking about I think about other things in the middle of a word or something and it throws me off and just generally confuses me. well I still have about 00 minutes of useless babbling to do. my boyfriend is one of the things that keeps randomly popping into my head and when I'm about to type it, my ass hurts or there's people screaming in the hallway or something. so then I'm thinking about that. I like to think about my boyfriend. sometimes I actually do it on purpose. and then other times I'm trying to pay attention in class or something and it becomes a distraction. anyway I don't really know where I'm going with this. my roommate let me read hers (she just did this a minute ago) and mine sounds a lot like hers - its kinda freaky. I think there's holes in this stream of consciousness theory (that looks funny I don't think its spelled right. I didn't think something else up there looked right either but I don't remember what it was. )  the holes!  I can't type as fast as I think and therefore I can't really keep up with what I'm actually thinking about. but its kinda clever anyway. there should be a way to actually hear peoples thoughts while they're thinking them or something like that. like ummm  what women want. but actually I don't really want anyone to be able to hear my thoughts just for the sake of science. because that's assuming someone could hear them whenever they wanted to and that's just creepy. I'm sitting weird and its hurting my right leg. and now my left arm hurts. I adjusted earlier to try and solve the diagonal thing (aha!  that's what was spelled wrong earlier. heheh. )  um someones knocking on our door. its weird. my roommate said come in and they went away. I don't know what's going on actually. rebeccas bitching because "quiet time starts at ten. "  that's true though. maybe they had the wrong room or something. this is a hard assignment for me because I'm anal and I don't want to leave things unfinished and I keep doing that. I wanted to finish what I was saying earlier. ooo 00:00. the time draws near. this is kinda strangely fun actually I might do it sometime. probably not 
__label__label0 What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 0% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish PROPNAME would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 00% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 0:00 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 0:00. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the LOCNAME. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 00% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw PROPNAME PROPNAME in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 00% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 0 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (0:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. 
__label__label0 I'm bored, da da da da seinfeld is funny I wish I could watch seinfeld all day david reminds me of seinfeld because david is one of the funniest people I know. it's cool he has steph. they're so good to each other, then again, I rarely hang out with both of them together. sweet seinfelds starting. hmmmm, I don't remember this episode, which is weird because I how long is this thing going to last. damn, I'm not far at all so do I just hit the finish button at the end or will it automatically end blah I guess I'll just hit the finish button when it comes blank blank bottles paper sauce ooooo ronin warriors I love the ronin warriors too bad they didn't have the whole set at the store o damn someone just messaged me I should've put an away message on but I never do. should I check it? but then I this won't be a stream of consciousness did I spell that right? o well I spell a lot of things wrong blah idealist eh, I'm an idealist too like seinfeld I wish I could be the next seinfeld I like making people laugh and he also gets paid for it I wish I could get paid for that so I won't have to compromise my beliefs and get a job 0 minutes, 0/0 fo the way through damn and a page of this thing, this thing is going to be long if I keep typing like this yarghh my hair is in my eye and it's itching me I wish I could just shave my head, but I don't like how it looks shaved like in 0th grade then people used to rub my head and it really pissed me off and I really don't want that I wish I could be like john lydon always reinventing himself, the only thing I have that comes close was my spikey hair in like 0th grade and the drab way of dressing too bad I get pissed off at people who dress like me god damn it my hair I want it to sop 0 minutes well shit I'm not even half done this is taking forever I just heard footsteps I wonder if that was roxy roxy so fine damn nose itching making me stop damn eye I need a hat but I really don't like hats the make my hair all flat and crap hard beds like hard beds but I like my tempurpedic one the best it rules and it's so comfortable I bet that was neal I hope he isn't messaging me about dinner just lost what I was thinking but roxy is nice too bad I'm too much of an ass to talk to her I would probably say something stupid and mean if she ever talking to me bad backs she elaine hurt her back I've seen the episode I was right but I think this was an early one blank blank blank jerri blank man she is weird I can't think of her name but she weird like that weird hitler doll she made that just kinda pissed me off damn belsen was a gas is a good song the sex pistols rule I wish I knew what that song was saying but I can't really understand everything rotten was saying  good pen that writes upside down 00 minutes ugh almost done 0 more minutes I wonder if my hands will hurt after this they're already tired ugh had to crack it even though it didn't crack so I guess I just stretched it man stretch marks are weird I wonder if I'll get them for some reason even though I won't get crazy pregnant stretch marks but I wonder if I can gain a crap load of weight then lose it to gain stretch marks my roommates making noise I wonder what he is doing I could turn my head but that requires work I don't like work I don't like school school sucks too much work I want to live in a shack in the woods like the Unabomber he had a cool place to live then again I don't have a million in liquid assets like he did so I wouldn't really be able to survive like he did damn he was smart too bad he went killing people otherwise he wouldn't been awesome hehe awesome reminds me of the ninja turtles that show ruled I used to want to be like leo leo was the man then they made the new one and he acts like he has a rod shoved up his ass damn why did they make him such a stiff uhh stiffler that a funny name like a boner man growing pains had that guy named boner on it I wonder if they realized what they did damn jerry's eyes are crazy o god watching it too much sweet almost done only 0 minutes I can sing a three minute song and be done why don't I try I've seen you in the mirror when the story began and I fell in love with you I love your mortal sin your brains are locked away damn it your brains are locked away yarghh why can't I remember I've seen you in the mirror when the story began and I fell in love with you I love your mortal sin your brains are lock away but I love your company I'll only ever leave you if you got no money I got no emotion for anybody else you better understand I'm in love with my self my self, my beautiful self no feeling a no feelings a no feeling for anybody else  there ain't no moonlight after mig damn wrong verse but only a minute left guess I can't type as fast as I can sing but I bet if they changed the keyboard that guy and cs was talking about I could type a lot faster stella what was that from why can't I remember I don't watch movies d 
__label__label1 I wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting?  I am getting a little hungry. PROPNAME's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. I think I should turn if off in a second. It smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. I miss my cousin PROPNAME so much being three hours away is too far. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. He probably has football practice. I hope we win the football game this weekend. That reminds me, last weekend was so crazy I don't think I am ever going to drive someone else's car again. Gee that was an adventure though. I think I should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. Why does my phone light keep turning off and on? I really need to get a new one already. I hope my friend likes the birthday present I bought him. Everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! That new cd that I bought is great I actually feel like listening to it right now. Oh great I have calculus homework. That stuff is so confusing. It was just yesterday when I was talking to PROPNAME and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at Tech. He said, I wonder what I got myself into. " And I began wondering that myself. Okay what was that cow noise that I just heard from my sisters computer? That thing is always making the weirdest sounds. My sister is so smart; I wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. But what do I know I'm just the middle child. My brother and sister are always saying I have "middle child syndrome," but what is that anyway. I wonder if my dad is out of work already. He always has a busy work load. Man I never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. I mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. Wow my dad is really smart too. And what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. I wish Tabby would come and visit us. I think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. I am really attached to her. I mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now I barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing at ORGNAME. I bet she is having a ball. That is her dream college and I can't wait to hear the stories at Christmas. I wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. Mmm I can almost smell it all the way over here. I am still hungry maybe I should go downstairs to get something to eat. 
__label__label1 Right now it is 00:00. I am sitting by myself in the dorm at ORGNAME ORGNAME. It is raining very hard outside. Earlier I went to Target and bought a Brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so I got home and then had to drive all the way back. I am from LOCNAME, LOCNAME and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. I love UT however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when I go out at night. I went through rush at the beginning of ORGNAME and pledged Theta. I am having so much fun and I love all of the girls in my sorority. My friends and I have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. When I walk in the room I don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. Also since living in LOCNAME I have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. I have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. I have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example Hula Hut, Shady Grove, Dirty's and much more. As I walk down the drag I notice that there is a large variety of people in LOCNAME. Yesterday I had my first encounter with the infamous PROPNAME who wears a tutu on sixth street. Apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. Also today when I went to PROPNAME bagels I looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. ORGNAME in LOCNAME is much different than my small private high school in LOCNAME. I never knew how sheltered we all were and I am so glad that I have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real" world. Right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. It is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. I live with 000 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. Although there are many distractions at ORGNAME ORGNAME, I am so glad this is where I live. I have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. Everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 00,000 plus people. Sometimes it is, like when I walked into my psychology class and say 000 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. But then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. I have already found a group of people I "hang out" with everyday and I almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. I am so excited for the LOCNAME game this weekend. Football is my favorite sport and I really hope the ORGNAME can beat ORGNAME this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. On Tuesday I joined a group call TAG, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, because I am trying to transfer in to the ORGNAME College. I am a little nervous about that because I heard it was very difficult. I am currently in the ORGNAME ORGNAME school as an English major. My classes seem to be going very well. I think after this paper I am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the Sex and the City DVD with my friends because they are all avid watchers while I have never seen a single episode. I never really get hooked on a TV series. I always just watch the show when it comes out on video. 
__label__label0 I really don't know what to type. I wonder what this keyboard is made of. I really hate it when I type and I have to keep on pressing the backspace. The air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it's really cold. My neck hurts. What the heck is that on the ceiling. was it there before? I remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck. Is that how you would spell spit-wads? There's so many words that I'm not quite sure how to spell. I remember I used to hate spelling tests in elementary. Wow, I couldn't believe that I sat next to someone today in my Calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class! I hadn't seen him in forever. I must say it really freaked me out. It was hot today. The walk to the business school killed me. On the one hand I love that I live in Kinsolving. Great food. Nice people. Close to the drag. Plus a whole lot of my classes are near Kinsolving. When did PROPNAME leave? It must have been around 00. I wonder when she is getting back. I'm excited to go home tomorrow. even if it is just for a few hours. I left so much stuff there! I mean, I would have my mom just send it to me, but if I give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room, there's no telling how long she would search, and definitely no telling what she would find. That's not to say that there's anything significant that would get me into any trouble. but I know that there's old notes from junior high. crazy pictures from those crazy party nights. and who knows what all else. Man, that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason. I definitely hate timed tests. Such as the SAT's. For starters I hate the fact that it's a standardized test. Secondly, I hate that it's timed. And above all else I HATE the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores. Now I know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants. However, some people are just not good test takers. ME! In school I can study, understand, and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes. But going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous. See, look at me. When I start talking about tests and intelligence scores I try to make coherent sentences; in other words I try to make myself seem intelligent. Enough of that. What else am I thinking about. I can't believe that I am actually in college. It sounds so cliché, but I can remember just yesterday when I was in elementary school. how my biggest concern was who I was going to play with after school. or what time recess was. It was great being a kid. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the freedom that I have now, but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility. I have my mom on my mind and I think that's what made me type that sentence. I just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what I was thinking at that moment. I would think of something and then type it. Now my hands seems to just be flowing, my fingers just seem to be hitting keys. That's weird to me for some reason. Well I only have a couple of minutes left. To me, 00 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts, I figured I wouldn't be able to do it. But here I am. This chair is so uncomfortable. It's so hard and so wooden. At least it's not a big, soft chair because I would never get anything done. I would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read. Reading. Something that is my downfall. I do love to read, but making sure that I have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story. Ouch. Something just bit me and I'm a little curious to know what it was. Probably an ant. ,isn't that gross! We have ants in our dorm room! 
__label__label1 I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 00 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like LOCNAME or LOCNAME. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of LOCNAME. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in LOCNAME come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at LOCNAME will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like LOCNAME lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb PROPNAME always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, PROPNAME is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of PROPNAME at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame LOCNAME. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 000 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. PROPNAME has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how LOCNAME lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 000 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing ORGNAME and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if PROPNAME is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 00 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike. 
__label__label1 SO before I started writing this, I was eating some PROPNAME's cereal. This cereal is so good. It tastes like chocolate and peanut butter and the best part about it is that it is a cereal and that means it's not that fattening. That's always good. But since I ate that, I'm kind of thirsty. Basically, right now all I want is some water. And that's kind of not letting me think about anything else. I'm also thinking about last night. I'm not sure if this guy likes me or not but he keeps leaving subtle hints about it but he flirts with a lot of girls so I'm not sure what to think about it. And I'm still not quite over someone else so I don't know what to do. But it's kind of something that gives you acceptance into a crowd of people. Especially snotty people like indians tend to be initially. which sucks. I wanted to come to LOCNAME to have some indian friends but this whole process of struggling to fit in is really hard. And like we learned in class, this is definitely a down time for me. I really miss my family. I wonder what they're doing in california right now. I'm sure dad is at work but mom must be so lonely without her daughters and her friends and her work. I hope she isn't sad and is finding something to do with her time. My mom is the most wonderful person in the world. She sacrifices everything for us. I mean, my parents sent me to UT despite all our financial hardships. That is so nice of them to do that and slightly selfish on my part. But I think I will be happy here once everything becomes a lil routine and I meet all the people I'm going to meet. At first, it seemed like I'd never meet anyone and I was really depressed about that too. I'm still really hungry. And I definitely need some lunch. I really don't want to go to Calculus today. I'm kind of tired of not feeling like the smart person anymore like I was in high school. This is definitely a rude awakening. Which is not fun. I'm definitely a worrier like the girl said who read my hand yesterday. I worry about everything. I worry about not doing good in college which means not a good job which means all in all. disappointing my parents. That's the saddest thing for me because all I want to do is make them happy. Also, I have to do good so I can stay here. And I can already see that I will NOT want to transfer to another school after this year. especially after I join KPhiG. Those girls are so innocent it's insane. It makes me feel almost like I know too much or something and I don't like that. I guess that's why you should save yourself for the right person so you don't have to feel that way in an extreme way. which thankfully I haven't done. But now I know ankur did. I can't believe he did. I guess I really don't know him like he says I don't. I wonder what he really thinks though? I mean. I think he used to like me but I guess he just sees me in a friend light now. Maybe he never even did like me and he just liked to talk to me when we were younger. But how do you lie that to much to a girl in e-mails and everything? I guess its possible if you can stay wtih a mentally incapacitated girl for over a year. He is just such a nice guy and I guess it was one of those childhood or actually teeny bopper fantasies of being with your first serious crush forever. Or even it might have had to do with the fact that ankur was the first indian guy I had been wtih and like that is a HUGE deal because there were no indians in south carolina AND I really want to marry an indian too. Either I'm marrying an indian or I don't get married at all because no other race can understand us. I mean yesterday at our sisterhood party. there were talking about how much hair indian girls have on their body. That is so awesome. no one but an indian girl can understand the strife of that. IT was something that dominated my thoughts for YEARS when I was growing up. And I didn't have any indian friends to share it with and now I can finally relate to girls. I think that is the primary reason I want to join kphig and plus it adds to the acceptance factor and you have immediate friends which is awesome. That's definitely work done for you. Sometimes I wonder if dilen's happy. He sometimes seems a lil down but I guess he is happy hanging out with white people cause he doesn't fit in well with indian people. It still makes me upset though to think that he has to face comments of him being gay. I just don't see it and he is not gay so people need to just calm down and realize not everyone who likes shopping and is weird around girls is gay. 
__label__label0 My computer is spiffy. I decided to name it PROPNAME, which means bitterness" apparently, but I was naming it after a character in the Star Wars books who is really cool. My computer gets in "fights" with a friend's computer. We type to each other over ORGNAME instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other. She named her computer Screwtape after a demonic character PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME developed. It's hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up, I'm on to a new thought. I'm also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because I hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes. However, I probably won't be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because I am typing so fast. One of my friends is IMing me, but I can't respond because I have to do this for an entire 00 minutes. I'm only at 0 minutes 00 seconds right now. I guess I can keep him waiting. He is one of the best friends you could ever have. However, I'm having a little trouble right now because he and I are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and I know she still adores him completely. Besides, I think they're much better for each other than he and I could be. He and I are both too proud and arrogant. She is proud, but she doesn't think she knows everything. She is pretty zany. I met her back in the 0th grade and we've been friends ever since. Our friendship has had its ups and downs, but it has never halted. I just couldn't hook up with her ex-boyfriend because that would be tacky, at least for the next couple years. I know she had be really upset and I could never forget the way they were together. Fortunately, I think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me. Speaking of romantic interests, there's a boy who lives next door to me who's pretty attractive. However, I think a lot of girls are attracted to him, so I would have a lot of competition, and I don't like competition. He seems like a really nice guy, though I'm thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot. One of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party, and apparently he came. I was locked away in my room, attempting to study because I have a quiz and a test tomorrow (actually later today, since it is now after midnight). I wish I could find a guy who wasn't so emotionally messed up or low in the self-esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away. Speaking of which, PROPNAME hasn't e-mailed me back. He and I got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation, though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going. So anyways, right now he is avoiding me. I wish he would talk to me, because he is one of the few people I trust to be honest, moral, and to steer me from harm. And I need to talk to a guy like that right now. I seem to attract guys who aren't particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people. The irony is, they like me, they tell me, because I'm so moral, pure, and sweet. Someone's knocking at the door. It took only 00 seconds to answer it. My roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab. She is really cool, probably one of the best possible roommates I could have. She is quite eclectic. She likes to knit, particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy. If I have enough energy, I fidget during lectures. I used to play with a hacky sack in high school. Some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it. It was cool, because my teachers trusted me. I even was friends with a few. I went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago. I'm going to miss them. Speaking of which, I need to e-mail Mr. PROPNAME, my former Bible/Philosophy/Greek teacher. 
__label__label1 today is a bad day. my boyfriend and I of 0 years just broke up because he is     at another university and is rushing right now. I have always been the center of his     world and now he acts like he doesn't even want to talk to when except for when it     is convenient for him. His roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me     and when I first heard that I got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the     restroom. PROPNAME, has been the ony guy that I have ever loved and I thought I would     marry him. we spend holidays together and I am already a part of his family and     he is part of mine. To think of him being with someone else just kills me and I am     so torn up right now that I cannot concentrate on anything but him. I had to end it     because I cannot continue to be hurt when all I have done is devote my whole life     to him. he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that     if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had     together. My thoughts are horrible right now and I NEVER thought that I could feel     so hurt and ashamed. My biggest fear is that he won't even care because he will     just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other     girls. PROPNAME has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he     was always worried about me forgetting about him. he was always the one that     couldn't stand not to see me for one day, and he was so in love with me tat     sometimes I got annoyed by it. Now the tables have completely turned because I     feel like I am incapable of functioning without him. for the past 0 years, everything     has been about him and so now I just don't know what to do with my time. Where do     I even start without him there to say I love you at night , or without him there when I     am having a bad day? This is the worse feeling I have ever felt and I just wish he     knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day! He will     probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just     party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks. I helped him move into     his new apartment and was not invited to come since, but all of our friends have     gone over there and seen him, so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that     position? I have not been real happy lately as it is because I just transferred to ORGNAME and     I hate it so far. I don't see anybody I know during the day and I feel so lonely     without jared, and now it will be permanent. This is the worse time for this to happen     and it makes me feel sick when I think about how it probably won't change. We     have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now     there is nothing perfect about us and all I feel is pain. he is going to the school that     I did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while I     have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what I get for it! I kept telling     myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be     much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about     him every day. I am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help     me during down times like this, but they have never seen me like the way I am     today. I have seen other people hurt this bad and I just thought to myself that it     must suck to be like that and now here I am in their shoes. he is the guy that has     always put a smile on my face, made me feel loved and made me a better person. I go to sleep at night thinking of him and I wake up in the morning thinking of him. We have had problems before and after a few days he couldn't stand fighting with     me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad. I keep     telling myself that if we don't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost     and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me, but I have such a bad     feeling that this time is different and he will just move on. I don't want to move on     but I have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people     because when I think about it too much, it tears my heart up. this is the guy that I     have planned my wedding with and after just 0 weeks of being away he has     already given me up. We have all the same friends and I will not be able to hear     about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until I start t feel     better. I have no energy and It scars me because I don't even want ot do my     homework of study because my mind is in such a  different place right now. He has     put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he     cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting     people. It just kills me to think that I am here and he is there without me because I     have always been included in everything he does. Now all of a sudden I am shut     out and I hope he realizes that he can't live without me. It is so hard for me to think     of him with somebody else because I know everything about him and what he likes     and does not and I don't ever want another girl to be that close to him. I love jared so     much and I wish he wouldn't have ever left or that I would have stayed there     because things could be different right now, but he enjoys making me jealous     when he talks about all the things he is getting to do. I know that I must just live     day to day knowing that things will get better but right now I can't see myself getting     over this for a long long time. I feel worthless today, am I am a very good person     so what did I do to deserve this? I am just hoping and praying that things can be     patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is     like without each other. I just don't want him to throw everything away, because he     is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I talked to him this morning and all     I could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody     would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as I do. I am only     wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if I will ever be on his mind     because I usually know what he is doing all the time. I am supposed to be the one     who goes to these parties with him and I am supposed to be with him when he     meets other poeple so they know that I am his girl and now all these girls that have     been in love with him while we have been together are going to love that we have     broken up. I am going on and on about how upset I am its just very hard because I     had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being     without him. And as  for school, I hope it gets better it will just take some     adjustments. I hope jared still loves me as much as he always has! 
__label__label0 beck lost cause. juan didn't call me back. I wish he would call me. it's driving me mad not knowing why he took off without saying a word. leaving me hanging and wondering what the hell was happening and why he left me in my car thinking up of the thousands of reasons why he did such a thing. I saw a red car with someone sitting inside of it. I don't know who it was but I can only think that it is his girlfriend, which may explain why he crouched down next to my truck when he got out. like he was hiding. then unexpectedly run back to the station towards the back where the fire truck was. beagles I should call marco up. I need to give cristina a visit at cypress bend. I'll be receiving some mail from angie soon and I'll be unpleasantly surprised because I think I already know what it might be but I don't want to see it. really tired and sleepy. grace and I talked about scary movies last night because we couldn't fall asleep. I want a radiohead tshirt. nirvana. japanese art prints. art sculpture class. sore fingers. two paper cuts on my hands. I wish the dvd player on my computer worked. sean messed up my computer :( goose time goes by pretty slow yet fast. I miss my angelfish and its tankmates. church. too many asians here. I don't like it. juan didn't reply to the voicemail I left him at 0 last night. he is mad because I took off too. I needed to drive back to austin. but I'm mad too because he did the same. I only reciprocated his actions. cold allergies and this smoothie tastes pretty good strawberries. still like the peach smoothie. I was really upset and exhausted after math today. I was shaking up the white cranberry/peach juice bottle to break the frozen juice that was inside of it. I miss joyce. I wonder how she is doing in school. she must have a lot of friends. psychology class is great. never get bored. occupy time. be resourceful. help mom and dad be less stressed out. mom is sick. she wants me to go home every weekend. juan claims he wants to see me. but we're not together". I don't know what's going on with him and his current girlfriend or fiance or whatever the hell she is to him but from how he is being with me. it makes me wonder. rebecca. I had a dream with him introducing me to his girlfriend elizabeth. except her name was roxanne in my dream. she was voluptuous and desirable. it made me sad. he always makes me sad. I'm reminded of that time I went to best buy with my sister and while passing by the movie theater parking lot. I spotted his car. the metallic sky blue eclipse. I was going to get a cream/white one. o well. and so I drove in front to see if it could be his car. it was his. I am so stupid to have stayed outside at the theater waiting for his movie to end just so I could see who he went to the movies with. joyce was playing arcade. when I saw him come out. he was the first one to come out. he was with a girl. he had his arm around her and I turned away just before he looked towards me. he passed right by me and walked away with his arm around her. and I stood by the window watching them leave. I got outside too and I just got so sad. I wasn't depressed. I was simply really truly sad. she was kind of chubby though. probably because she is pregnant. if all of that nonsense was true. abortion. legal age. drinking strawberry daquiri. applebee's johnny carino's PROPNAME. marble slab. I wish I could talk to PROPNAME right now. talking to him briefly yesterday on my drive to austin actually kind of cheered me up after I had left the fire station in pain. my heart has been broken yet I still hang on to someone who only wants my body. I miss being held by him. I miss being hugged by a guy. jason and sean are so weird. grace is weird too yet she always brings in weird people and claims that they're weird. silly girl.

__label__label1 Well, I do not really know what I am thinking right know. Actually I think that I am a really slow typer and that I really need to read for all my classes, but I am just too tired to do that right now. My desk lamp is really bright and it hurts my eyes unless it is facing down. I am really excited about tonight because I am going to the Chi-O pledge retreat. I hope that it is fun because I do not really know any of the people in my pledge class and I want to get to know them all. I like all the decorations in my room that the actives put up for me. The red and yellow balloons are starting to look bad so I think I need to take them down now. I think that I will save them so that I can make a scrapbook later with all of the Chi-O things that I have acquired. I am really hungry right now. what do I want to eat?  I am tired of eating Mexican all the time which is really weird because I love Tex-Mex. Oh well, . I really think this is a weird assignment. I keep getting on weird subjects. I think that I need to get my nails done really bad, but I just do not know when I will find the time to do it. I should probably check on my laundry. I wonder what we will do tonight at the Chi-O house?  I am not looking forward to putting on a swimsuit. I need to find some dance classes to take so that I am doing something active and not just sitting on my butt all the time. I am really thirsty. I can't wait to go buy all the Tops pictures I took this weekend. I miss my sister and I think that I might go home on the weekend of the 00th. my ex-boyfriend's birthday is today!  I wish that I could see him. well. maybe I can finish the roll of film that I have so that I can get it developed before PROPNAME's B-day on wednesday I think. I hope that PROPNAME does not get to HH soon. oh well, my back is starting to hurt from sitting in this chair. I hope that my to heals well. I can not sit still . I really like the Chi-O things written all over my mirrors in red and yellow. my stomach is so hungry. I seem to have a bigger appetite now that I am in college. that is probably not a good thing. I really hope that I do not gain the freshman 00. um. I need to call my mom or just send her an e-mail with all my book costs on it so that she can call dad. it is about 0:00 and I have to be at the Chi-o house at 0:00. should I look cute?  I bet that some people will get dressed up, but I just really do not care. when is PROPNAME going to get back so we can go get food. I really like the posters that we finally received to day, which took forever to get here. They add character to the dorm room. I wonder who I am going to live with next year?  I hope that PROPNAME does not feel left out when she finds out that I am going to live with PROPNAME and PROPNAME next year and who knows who else. I mean she could always room with us I guess, but I think that she would not have as much fun because she never wants to go out with us she just stays home and studys, which is fine, but it just seems like she would do better somewhere else. I do not really care. I guess that can be left up to her. 
__label__label1 It all of a sudden becomes hard to think when you are instructed to. haha. I am so overwhelmed with everything I have to do this weekend. I have so much reading to catch up on in all my classes and I am going to have to do it this weekend or I will never get caught up. I hate biology, I'm so lost, maybe I should drop it before it's too late. But that would be kind of dumb. I don't know how I'm going to pass the first test. I wonder if anyone else is as lost as I am. At least I'll be done with this pretty soon and I will have one less thing to think about. Maybe I can get LOCNAME to drive on the way home for PROPNAME's birthday. I really don't feel like driving all the way back but I guess I have no choice. Wow, I really need to get her something. maybe a she would like a shirt from the co-op. My phone is ringing but it is across the room and I guess since I am being timed it wouldn't be smart to answer it. I wonder who it is. hope it's not too important. I guess I'll just call the number back when I am done with this. I'm really hungry, maybe when I finish this I'll go eat at the cafeteria. Hopefully they will have something good because Jester City Limits is too expensive and not that great either. I doubt they will though, a peanut butter sandwich doesn't sound that bad. My room is so quiet right now, I wish PROPNAME would get back so we could go eat. I hate the annoying sound of fans which is the only sound I hear, but our room is too hot without it. I doubt they will ever fix the air conditioner. I really need to order some concert tickets online before it is too late. Taking Back Sunday and Saves the Day, Panic, and so many more I wish I could get but I'm poor. I guess I'll only go to two nights of Panic too. I wish I was in a band, then I wouldn't have to be in biology. Yay!  PROPNAME's back and the T. V. is on. I would rather be listening to music but I figured I should do this in silence because if I was listening to music I would just sing in my head the whole time. I can't stand dumb commercials or long ones. PROPNAME just reminded me I have to fill out that application. one more thing out of a million. I really need to get on top of things. Too bad I'm not more creative or that application would be easier. Hmmm only a few more minutes to think. I'm tired too bad I have too much to do or I would take a nap. A shower would be nice as well. I also need to go check my mail. I guess I'll do that when we got eat or something. 0,0,0,0,0. finish!   
__label__label0 Well, Sitting here doing this assignment at 00:00 a. m. and my lazy butt just woke up. I can't believe that I wake up so late nowadays. I remember my freshman year where I slept a few hours a night and got by fine. I'm feeling a little bad about myself for not working out this morning like I wanted too. If I could just get up when I wanted to then there would be not problem. But no, I have to stay in bed until the last possible second before class. On Wed. I have my first class at noon, and I was late. How pathetic is that?  How can I not get up before the sun has reached its peak position over the city?  Typing this is making my forearm hurt a little. I first noticed that when I was shooting a basketball yesterday. I think I might have pulled something lifting weights the other day and at least worked something that I don't usually work out so it hurts a little. Is strange, I am supposed to be sitting here thinking of stuff and my mind blanks out, but when I am supposed to be concentrating, my mind decided that then is the appropriate time to start racing with ideas and contemplations not associated at all with what I am doing. I actually like this assignment, its kind of nice to just sight down and write down what I am thinking about. I tried to start a journal once but to no avail. I am not a person of habit. I cannot just dedicate myself to something at a certain time everyday or week whenever unless it is something that I have to do, such as class, or a job if I ever find one. I felt really disappointed that I could not find a job this summer. Why was I having such a hard time?  I have problems with things like that, I hate doing the first part of something, such as actually finding the job or deciding on a career. That's one of the reasons I am taking this class as a Junior, because I don't know what else to take. I can't decide what I want to do for the rest of my life. I would be so much easier if I had someone say you are going to be a business man or a teacher, take these classes, and don't suck it up like you have been doing for the first two years of your college career". And I would be like "OK, fine, I can do that" and then I would do it, but probably not to the full extent of my ability. I have a hard time doing things to hardcore for an extended amount of time. I guess everyone is like that but even things I like to do, after time I start slacking, such as car audio fabrication. I like to build things out of fiberglass and my last project really sucked it up. I guess it was a learning experience but after a few days of working on it I got dismayed because it didn't look as good as I had hoped it would and finally said "the hell with it" and just finished it. Now I am ready to chunk it and start anew. But I like building things, so that my be the reason too. 
__label__label1 its raining outside and it has been for quite a while, I can't believe I stayed out late when I had to get up at 0 in the mourn for army rotc that was stupid bc I sleep through it like an idiot and I sleep through my 0 oclock class for govt. man I can't believe I did that but what am I going to do about it now why do I do this all the time I ve been really good at doing shit lately, because I have to for a rotc but dammit why did I sleep through today, well I'm probably going to have to pay for it tomorrow I'm just disappointed in myself and I let my squard leaders down and that is who I went out with last night which does not make it any easier man I got to piss hold on, well I got to go work out today sometime to make up for missing this morning damn that really pissis me off, I wish I could just go back in time to 0 am, and get my lazy ass out of bed, we got a game tomorrow against ORGNAME I hope we kick thre ass, then I'm going over to an arotc ranger party to watch the fight between del la joya and mosler I think, I can't wait but now that I missed the pt this mourn I don't really want to be there with all of my leaders bc they now I missed this mourn man I would pay a 000 bucks to go back in time, I really wanted to see what I was going to score on the pt test, I mean I know I wasn't go to score very good, bc they smoked our asses the days before but still I wanted to do it. oh I so don't want to study today but I know that I'm going to have to, I have not done any readings for psy and govt and I really need to, yeah I'm going to go run and work out then, ill do some reading and shitoh man the 00 minutes is almost up, I shouldn't complain to much about it, its a lot easier than some of the other hw my classes give me 
__label__label1 well as I was clicking on the button that allows you to begin, I noticed that I forgot the last digit of my social security number, aka, ut eid. well for whoever care, it is 0. my I'd number is 000000000. there now I can get credit for this assignment. anyway, I don't know what to write about. I'm sure that after a while your stream of consciousness" I totally spelled that wrong, will take over. I bet everyone writes this at the beginning of their assignment just because they don't know what else to write about and aren't bored enough to be honest yet. so I am really mad about my laptop. last night is just turned white and shut down. I tried turning it on this morning and it wouldn't so I took it to the its  or something like that. it is the place where they are supposed to fix your computer. well they didn't. nope they just gave ma 0 0oo number to call which took me 00 minutes and I still didn't talk to a real person. I always type didn't instead of didn't. that is annoying. so I took the battery out of my computer and it works now but I still need a new battery which better be under warranty because I just got the thing in may. so I go to check my e mail and what do you know, I have another freaking virus on my computer. I am about to scream. seriously, I am using my roommates computer right now. it is the second one since I got here in june and it is pissing me off. I mean  I am not even one of those internet surfing kids, I just use it for research and e mail and papers and stuff so I don't even know how I got the dang thing. so now I have decided to type with the correct hand position so my typing is considerably slower and my spelling considerably poorer. ya screw this. I wish I would have paid attention in keyboarding class. man, I am only half way done. so this is my roommate's computer. she is sleeping right now. don't get me wrong, I love the girl to death but she is freaking emotional. it was her and her boyfriends 0 year anniversary today. I don't think he is good for her. my arm is starting to hurt. I know why it is because here in jester you have no freaking desk space and the fridge is shoved into your back. in kinsolving it was heaven. I miss it there a lot better community. my professor was talking about freshman insecurity or whatever today. he was right. I don't consider myself to be an insecure person but college will do it to ya, especially when you don't know anyone. I bet there are people like me who can just sit here and type crap, never letting on to what they are really thinking about. I obviously already have a little, but to tell you the truth, I am really thinking about how bad I am at typing. I don't know why I think I have to type fast for this. it isn't like you are counting my words. actually, it is just making it harder for me to continue my bullshit, excuse the French. why do people say that?  I think my dog back home is depressed. I know she misses me, I'm the only one she liked. she is always at my neighbor's house because they let her in and feed her. the sad thing is, I think my neighbor is trying to replace her husband with my odg. they just got divorced, one of the super religious couples you would never expect to. she is such a softie anyway. ya I def think that she is using my dog for company. I don't know why though because she already has two dogs of her own. ok well I have this meeting to go to tonight. it is for the lassos, no wait, the lonestars. I can't forget to call my friend lindsay or is it lindsey so we can meet to walk there. ya I am about to nope, I just did sneeze. God bless me. I think everyone should believe in God. he is great  even if there is no proof, that is where faith comes in right?  right. 
__label__label0 Right now, I'm a little confused. I'm not sure how one goes about tracking their feelings, or even focuses on them long enough while typing. I'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this. While I'm a little frustrated with the assignment, I think I would much prefer to be the one typing than whoever the poor soul is that has to read 000 some odd of these things for whatever purpose. OK. My arm itches. Now I feel stupid for typing that. I'm a little tired. It's almost 0 at night and I've been at school all day. 00 and a half minutes. I'm sitting in the UGL. I like their computers because they are much faster than mine at home. I only have dial up. Also, I like the library computer lab because I like to listen to all the clicking of the keys on the keyboards by the other people in the room. Now I'm a little self conscious that I may be hitting the keys too loud. I'm typing much quieter now. 00 and a half more minutes. I'm in a chair that rotates and rocks. I like chairs like that because I can move around. I can't sit still too long. I'm a fast mover. Even in class I'm constantly rocking, or fidgeting, or drumming with my fingers. I'm getting tense. I'm anxious for the 00 minutes to be up. 00 and a half minutes. I'm running out of things to say. This is very much like a one sided conversation. OK. I'm stumped. I'm sitting here racking my brain, but in doing so I think I'm violating the purpose of this assignment as being random. 00 more minutes to go. My arm itches again. Ha ha. I have my cell phone next to the keyboard. My girlfriend got it for me, but I hate it. It gets horrible range, and the ring is weak. It rings like an old feminine man. I'm ashamed to carry it around. My girlfriend insists, though, so I do. It's the path of least resistance. I'm better at arguing than she is, but she can argue longer, and in the end, it's her endurance that wins out. I'm swinging in my chair. I seriously hope no one has to read this. I hope this is some study about how long 00-00 year old males typically type in 00 minutes or something. My sincere condolences to whomever has the misfortune of pouring over each one of these with the intent to interpret some psychological insights. 0 more minutes. I'm perking up a little bit. I can see the proverbial finish line. I'm swinging in my chair again, but my arm stopped itching. Yeah!  0 minutes. OK. Now, I'll admit. I'm stalling. I'm holding out for 0 minutes. This is like watching water boil. What I'm feeling?  I've never been so anxious all day as I am right now. 0 minute. I'm stumped. 00 seconds. Bye! 
__label__label1 Ok. I really don't know what I am supposed to be doing. I am just thinking. Hmmm. What am I thinking about. my stomach is growling. oh look its my jeremy camp cd I have not listened to that in a while. I wonder if carrie and I will drive to the concert in abilene on thurs. I don't want to make her go if she does not want to. hmmm. thirsty now. why is this water bottle green. that color is not so great to look at. interesting. thank goodness its friday. I miss home. college is not as easy as I thought it would be. its too quiet in this room. I can't stand it being so quiet. I want to get up and have someone to talk to but no one is here. What is up with my stomach. Its jumping around in knots. Goodness gracious. Mmm. M&ms look good in that cup over there. Ok. Five minutes have passed. it was not so bad. I have so much to do today. I have to get my cell phone fixed with some more minutes. I wonder if they will make me sign another contract. My mom might be right about that. I need to make a list. Right after I am done with this that is what I will do. Wonder when PROPNAME's class ends. I bet she is sleeping. Art history can't be that fun. My mouth is watering because of all of the hunger. What am I to do. Its all about willpower. The football game is too early tomorrow. I need to figure out if I need to move my car out to the garage. Why don't the stupid people keep me informed. Its crazy, I pay 000 for a parking space but you have to move it on game days. Craziness. Its cold in here. I need a jacket. O, the blanket will work. Wonder what texture this thing is made out of. I will turn off the fan. That will help. hmm. It is hard to consciously think about your thoughts. Who would have thought. I wonder how long that helium balloon is going to stay up. It has been four days. My foot itches. I miss PROPNAME. I wonder if he will call today. Hopefully he got my letter. I wonder what he is doing. ok I need to stop thinking about him. I can't look at these pictures on my board. They just make me sad and reminded of home. I hope PROPNAME is doing alright. I wondered why little PROPNAME imed me. I bet he is asking me a question about a girl. Hehe. He is such a cute little boy. Hopefully he is doing alright too. Ok now I am bored. Why is that highlighter on the floor. Is it mine or PROPNAME's. Must be mine. Fell out of my bag. I need to read today. Maybe take a nap first. Have to go to the store and get a new earring because my ear hurts. Its no good. Why does it have a big lump on it. I think it must be infected. Wow. That was a slow minute. Need to talk to mom about some money and paying PROPNAME back. I need to find that paper that says the stuff. so much to do. Those are some pretty trees outside. Austin does have better weather than LOCNAME. Hope it does not rain more today. well time is up. bye. 
__label__label1 As I look at this blank space, what am I going to write about?  There is no topic really, so I guess its up to me. I'm thinking about how I need to cancel my doctors appointment because the bug bites that have been on my leg for over two weeks are finally starting to go away. I have never been to the doctor at the ORGNAME. That also reminds me that I need to go give a list of my professors so that I can get extended time. This whole timed writing thing is fairly new to me. I have had extended time for a long time, so its never really been an issue for me. But I do like this writing assignment, its nice not to have any rules and to just follow my stream of consciousness. I mean we wrote stream of consciousness papers in high school, but never like this for an assignment. It amazes me how far technology has come. What did students do before the internet? I mean, look at what I'm doing right now, this is crazy. How did people function and know things without internet and email. I have basically grown up in a world that has always had computers. granted when I was really young not everyone had computers, but for as long as I have been of age to where the internet would benefit me, it has always been there. That also applies to cell phones. I simply do not understand how people would find one another and get a hold of each other without them. I am so dependent on mine. Oh no, I just looked down at my to do list and realized I really need to call my owl pal for this week, I have never really met her, and they told me she was special needs. " from what I have heard she is not really the sorority type, and well, neither am I in some ways, but I really hope I connect with her because I think she feels like an outsider. the pledge trainers said she would go sit off by herself and I am really sad for her because I know what its like to not really know anyone and be forced, almost, by family to be in a sorority. but I hope I can show her how neat it actually is. I hope that talking about music will be a bridge between us. but god, I hate the fact of having to do something. Being obliged to do something really annoys me and it makes me not want to do it at all. I think I have gotten worse about that over the years. Over the years, hah, I'm only 00. but then again, I look at kids in high school now and think they look so young, its crazy, its like once I left for college, I can no longer be categorized as another kid. Its kind of sad really, and ill miss those days of always living at home with my parents to take care of me and annoy me, but then again, there's always holidays and summer vacation. I really hope that I enjoy this class and that it is not just so tedious to do the work. Actually, when I was reading the book the other day, some of it actually interested me, and I'm so thankful for that, it is so difficult for me to pay attention to things if I'm not interested. I don't know if its like that with everyone, or particularly because I'm adhd, but if something doesn't engage me, even the slightest bit, it is tedious to force myself to focus on it. I really hope that I find something to do with my life that I love, because that would really help, hah, I'm sure everyone says that, but I really do hope that that happens. I'm not exactly the hardest worker, but I feel like I'm going to be alright somehow. Its not like I can just sit on my ass with a trust fund or anything, because I know my parents aren't going to pay for me after college, but I know that I'll be ok. I sometimes worry that I won't be able to give my kids the same opportunities that my parents gave me, and that might be hard, but I don't really want to have kids unless I am mature and financially stable. Bringing it back to summer vacation. this summer I lived at home and didn't really work, but that's besides the point. I just wanted to talk about how I went home and totally noticed how privileged my friends and I are. I don't think that some of them really get it because their parents sheltered them a great deal more than mine did, but I mean, my friends from high school are some rich, spoiled brats, and I knew that before, but it really fazed me this summer. Its sad to me that my friends don't really know what its like to not have money, and I shouldn't be talking, I spend so much money and it doesn't really matter, I'm going to really need to learn how to budget money when its my own. Or learn how to not buy useless shit that just makes the place all cluttered. I hope we get more assignments like this one because its nice to get stuff out on the table, and I have a feeling no one is really reading this, because that would be a pain in the ass to read all this text that 000 students wrote. I need to call a couple of my friends at other schools, but its such a pain in the ass, bc schedules are never the same and we always miss each other and its hard to keep up with people and impossible to know every detail, but for some of my friends that stuff doesn't really matter and I know we will always be friends when we are together, and for that I am very grateful. with one minute left, what I'm I going to talk about, I wonder if it stops letting me type, or if I have to exit myself, that's crazy how its up there ticking away the seconds. turns out this wasn't so bad, and I'm glad I got it done now, as opposed to tomorrow when I have no class. well, talk to you soon, times up. tootles          
__label__label1 I'm here in the computer lab doing this assignment and wondering how in the world are they going to get any information out of what I write. I think there is so much out there that we can't understand and this is one of them. last night I had a weird dream well no it wasn't last night it was the night before I was in a school but I don't recall which on and then someone shot me! yet no one cared. I was all alone and then my family shows up and they seem interested for a while and then they forget about the situation and wonder around without taking me in to and emergency room. I thought it was weird but then again I later on had another dream I don't remember what it was right now but I know that I had to do with lack of attention. I figure these dreams are happening because I'm far away from home and I don't receive the same attention, its just a matter of adapting to different environments. its weird how I'm here in the lab and everyone is in there own little world for instance the girl next to me  seem s to be having problems with the computer yet she never asks for help, why? and then there's a girl in front all into her study or research I don't know what she is doing and she looks so interested. I really don't know what else to write I mean those things came to the top of my mind once I started writing but now I don't know. I really hope arturo writes to me this coming week I mean he is in the army and I'm really scared for him specially since his last letter where he told me they were going to send him to iraq. that sucks because I got attached to him. specially at prom the night was so perfect everything was going great until it was time to leave to our houses. I mean why can't I find a guy who's like him I mean he is great he is sensitive, sweet, crazy, funny I don't know I could go on but why can't I find someone? he would be perfect but he is too slim we look like a 00 when were next to each other not that I'm fat but I'm fatter than he is. if he could only gain lets say maybe 00 pounds he would be dream guy material. ericka is changing a lot I don't know what her problem is I think it all turns out to be that she has no goal in life. she knows she wants to be a doctor because that's what everyone tells her but she doesn't really now what it is she want to do with the rest of her life. she is a lost child, all she cares for is FUN I mean its important to have fun but everyday? that's just not right. what does she want to have a boyfriend for only for sex? she is always talking about some other guy and this and that and what does she expects from this guy . she changed so much we use to be close friends but now since she is in mexico and has been there for the last year and will be there for the rest of her education I don't even know if I can still call her a friend. it really bothers me how I can get so excited for her when things are going good yet she doesn't care if I'm sad, mad , happy if I need to be hear . its all about her and just having fun talking to people when they're happy and be talking dirty and things of that matter? why!? I don't know if she is always been like that just that I hadn't noticed or she is just changed. her friends over there have great influence on her and I personally dislike them I don't think they will ever do anything with there life's because they're simply not able to work for their money they're so use to asking their dad for money. they don't appreciate the value of hard work or the having a do go to school because eventually that will put food on the table for your children. they are just plain stupid thinking their father will always be around to give them what they want. and now  ericka has become just like them and I hate that. this writing helps out . I've always thought this but not a soul new about it and now God knows who is reading this and wondering what the hell is she complaining about. or oh well . I don't know I just had to say it . and now I'm waiting for the 00 minutes to be over using up the rests of the seconds that . oh well they're over. 
__label__label0 Last week I took a Chinese Clep test. It started out very well, I understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. As you know, the Cantonese language is written in two different formats. One way, the tradition way, was the one I learned since I was a little kid. The other format was a newer, I believe it originated in LOCNAME LOCNAME or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking". Anyways, I opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. So I spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. Then, I decided to just skip through to the end. That is when I figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. "Damn it!" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. But of course, that was last week, and I already have my results back from the test. I believe I did relatively well. Relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. Today, Monday, is the first day I have been to my RLM Biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. I must say, I am completely exhausted. Biology discussion was quite an episode. We had an TA that had a really really bad accent. Much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. Some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. Then we took a quiz, which I found to be a bit difficult because I didn't understand teh oral review. I had to buy books today. Spent a whopping 000 dollars just on two stupid books that I probably won't be needing much. I could have found many many other uses for that 000, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. Geez, look at my grammar in this essay, I think my english teacher would have a heart attack. Psych class was pretty interesting today. Dr. PROPNAME brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. I was completely fascinated by the experiment. Too bad I can't say the same for my Philosophy class. Its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. And so I obeyed. I notice that when I'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. But of course, I wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. You can definitely tell at what point in the lecture I crashed. The funniest part is, I lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. I think since I have been here at LOCNAME for the fall, I have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. I have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. I worry about other stupid things that I feel the need not to bring up at this moment. However, I have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. I have been recreating too much. This weekend though, we went to LOCNAME LOCNAME to see a friend that came up to visit us from ORGNAME. LOCNAME LOCNAME was nothing like I had imagined. I absolutely loved it. Everything except the coldass water. Then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. It felt like summer again. Of course, I had enrolled in the UT Summer program. A little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. I miss summer. 
__label__label0 As I look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 00:00AM on September 00. I am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago. They still should strike a painful memory in every Americans life. I remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment. I also feel a little stress with all ORGNAME the homework that college brings along with it. LOCNAME is so much different than my hometown of LOCNAME, and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it. However, I have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far. I cannot wait to say that I am a graduate of the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. That will mean so much to me and my family, since it will be an amazing accomplishment. I just remembered that my laundry basket is full, and I need to do that sometime before Friday since I may be leaving town for a Pat Green concert. Hopefully, the laundry room at the end of my floor, 0th in Jester West, will not be full. Surely I can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that I did not complete. I sure hope I can adjust to college as well as I have set my goals. My roommates are out of the room right now, and I am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here. They are both from LOCNAME also, and I have been friends with them for about 0 years. My parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much I appreciate them paying for me to come down here. I know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence, but me and them know it is for the best. I am convinced that the Business program at ORGNAME will set me up for a very successful life. My hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously, and my eyes are starting to close. I feel like falling asleep, but I know how much work I still have left to do. For some reason, I get most of my work done around or after midnight. It helps that I don't have a class until 00 on MWF and 00 on ORGNAME. I am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church. It is important to me to find a church in LOCNAME and not forget the ways from which I was raised. Many people believe LOCNAME is so liberal that every student comes out weird, but I believe there is something for everyone in Austin. I have already met so many people just like me, and it is awesome. By far I can tell that college will be the best time of my life. The only thing I wish I could change is the dorm food. I am  getting so tired of chicken every meal. I do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken. Well the saying goes, everything tastes like chicken anyways. Maybe next year I can get an apartment with some of the new people that I meet and possibly the guys from LOCNAME too. I am trying to figure out why my email is not working. It keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying. Oh well, two more days to the weekend. LOCNAME comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game. I saw some of the football players today. Wow, they are so huge. They are like a different breed of people. I want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big. I know it is some sort of phenomenon or something. I figured out that in 0 minutes I have to find something new to do so I am already brainstorming. I wish every paper was this easy. English papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind. It could go on forever. I never have to stop and think. Dell: what an amazing company. How does someone without a college education make so much money?  I hope my college education will lead me to success like that. Well, time is up. 
__label__label0 Why can I not think of anything to type the moment when I click the start link? This is so weird, I just hungry everytime after I am done showering. Why is that? Is it because while I am showering my body also takes the food away from my stomach? I wonder why my feet are so smelly even though I have already taken a shower. My roommate seems to be busy all the time and never seem to have any time to chill or hang out with me and some other people. I think that guy in the SPE meeting today was pretty cute. Hopefully I will be able to meet him sometime. Wow, it is getting pretty late right now and I am getting a little bit sleepy. I took the Pretesting for the psychology required experiment testing and it was really long! It was so detailed that I was about to give up and continue it some other time and go to sleep instead. Man, I really don't know what to do about Calculus. I seem to be struggling in all of my math classes and if I still don't get help by next Monday, I will be screwed. I feel kind of floaty? Is that the word to describe it? My feet are really cold right now, I wonder why. My hands are a little cold too. Hmm. I think it's because that the temperature in this room is getting lower and lower. I really want the temperature to go up a little more if not it's going to be freezing in here like my other friends' dorms at LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man. I still have 0 more classes tomorrow but good thing that I don't have any classes on Friday! Yay! I think I am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be hard for me to find something that will match with it. If not, I can ask my sister if she wants to buy it from me or not. Hopefully she would want it so then I wouldn't have to make a trip back to the mall to return it. I am feeling really tired and sleepy right now. I wish I can go to sleep but I have to get some work done before it will be too late. Hopefully I will be able to go back to LOCNAME sometime this or next weekend. I really want to see my cute little brother! I miss him a lot! Ouch, my right arm is aching now. I think it's because I have been using the computer too much and typing a lot. I think I really do need a break from the computer. Where is he? I really want to talk to him but it seems like he is either always away or I talk to him and he never replies. That is really annoying. My contacts feel a kind of weird. I think I should take them out and put on my glasses instead. Hmm. I really do wonder why my roommate has to leave that music on forever. Is it because it soothes her from all of the pain and stress through out the day? That's probably the reason why. I really do wonder why she wants to be a vegetarian. I think it's quite interesting even though I really don't think I can live without eating any meat in my life. Meat is just too good. I wonder why one of my friends today acted kind of strange. I think she probably felt bad for me for not being able to make it in time to eat dinner with me or it's probably because that she wants to find out something that has to do with either me or this other friend of mine. I think that it really annoys me a lot when she acts in this immature way and causes me to not be able to trust her even more. A few of my friends on AIM are messaging me and I am trying to reply to them even though I am concentrating on typing this up. She was asking me about whether I will be going to the next football game or not. Should I go? But I think that the tickets is going to be rather expensive but going to one wouldn't be that bad since I have never gone to one before. Man. it's only been a few days of my first classes in college and I am gradually starting to hate it. Why do college math professors just scribble random things on the board? I mean can they at least have a little bit more organization? It makes me so confused on understanding the material and I can't even figure out how to solve the homework problems. I wish I can change my calc professor but I think that is going to be impossible. Ouch, both of my arms hurt now, I think I should be getting off the computer really soon. An individual sports package? What is that? For 00 dollars? I really don't know if I should get it because I don't really want to spend all of my money on football tickets. All right, I think my time is almost up and I am so happy I can go to sleep now!  
__label__label1 My window is just above my bed. I can't see the stars but the lights of the city substitute nicely. I wish my bed were higher so I could lay in it and look out the window over the city. This is the one place that I feel on top of the world even though lately my world has been crumbling down. I see the cars going by, some steadily others as though they were racing. and the last remind me of my drum major in high school who used to yell at us for lollygagging. " I imagine they are going to exciting places. Places where they don't worry if their boyfriend is cheating on them or why they can't seem to motivate themselves to do the assigned readings for class. I pretend for them. I make them my social group. I have named the girl who sits on the wall outside dobie PROPNAME. I think its a nice name. She is always out there to smoke cigarettes, I imagine because her roommate is the type that is anal and can't stand to have the rules bent much less broken. PROPNAME hates that. That is why she wears shorts 0 sizes to small that make her legs dimple while she is perched atop the wall. I am lonely. When I look out my window I feel like everyone else is too. We are a disjointed people connected by this city, these lights and sounds that are the stuff of civilization. I'm sure someone else is in that blue building with the step-like structure. sitting somewhere looking out, feeling the same as me. I like it when it rains, when the sky is heavy and dark and sad. I wish it would rain here. I have never seen that from my window. I think that I might like to live in a tall building like this later on in life, but I would have to live there alone. Its hard to bask in my emotions while my roommate debates who loves who more with her feminine boyfriend before they discuss what they're going to do for their umpteenth month anniversary. My suitemate fits me better. I feel how she acts, but I can't express myself that way for too many reasons. one very big one being my excessively religious parents. They would flip. No one understands my thoughts. I care so much more about the whys than the what is, but I act the opposite. I wish I could do nothing but read all day. I'd go in the living room in the pappazan or however you spell it chair by the window in there-but it would have to be higher too--to see out the window. That is what connects me, keeps me here, keeps me from floating away. So I would sit there and I would read. I would go all sorts of places and be all sorts of people but my window would be my anchor as I sailed through these many parallel universes. I think my favorite would be in a PROPNAME PROPNAME novel. they're so warm. There's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think. I wish I didn't think. I try to keep myself so busy that I don't, but my mind won't be constrained. Its only controlled by the window, my looking glass sanctuary. Its solitude without loneliness. I feel the most lonely with lots of people. on the south mall at noon, walking to class. So many people with such well put together lives, purposeful strides and slender hips. I watch them. I am behind a tree. I wear long skirts to cover what I wish wasn't there, with my thick dark hair pulled back, tugging on my wrinkled shirt that won't ever stay into place. I am magic though, I have powers. I can be invisible. No one ever knows that I'm there. No one ever knows I'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights. I don't know about anything anymore. I wish someone would just tell me what I'm supposed to do. that there was some fated order of things. That would be easy to accept, that is why we have religion. It gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is. but for some of us that won't suffice. No doctrine will halt the whys of my mind, I will always wonder about it if not the things it claims. I'm confused and lonely and at my window. It doesn't make sense. But tomorrow I'll get up and I'll go to class. I'll say hi to all my friends and smile. The weird thing is I'll even enjoy it and be distracted so that I only focus on the what is. I'll watch TV and do homework, and probably even go to a club with the cute guy I can't ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin. (yes there are so many problems). But then I'll go to bed. I'll lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain, and I'll think about all the whys of my life and how I'll probably never figure them out, just how to distract myself from them. 
__label__label0 Well here I am doing my first assignment for college. I really like it so far. I had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place. My life is like that though everything seems to just work. I don't know if I am the only person that feels like this (I doubt it) but I feel like I will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but I don't have a clue what it is that I will be doing. My dad seems to get pissed whenever I tell him that I don't know what I want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing. I think that it is because they don't fund my bill. My dorm room is freezing I am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such. My girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at (she had surgery) I hope she is ok. We have been going out for awhile now and I think I love her. I know that I am 00 and don't know what love is but it just feels so right. She is in her last year of college at ORGNAME now so I will only get to see her once a month or so. Everyone says to break-up but it is only one year then she (hopefully) will come to ORGNAME. I don't understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan. I mean maybe if I was one of those people that just love to be in love I would but it isn't that I miss the physical part (though I do) I miss her someone else won't replace that I want her not a body. Now to bore you out of your minds, I am very interested in nutrition/bodybuilding. I played football for 0 years and weighed in at a fat laden 000 lbs. my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football. well I quit due to many factors and guess what it isn't ok to just be fat. I have worked my butt off literally. I now am 000 lbs and have gained strength. I estimate myself at 00% body fat but I want to do better and I know that I can. I spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets. I think it may be dominating my life. But it isn't a hobby it is a lifestyle. But really who else eats every 0 hours? And for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus I have these cursed dine-in dollars but I can only eat about 0 things here everything is terrible for you! I am not exaggerating ok maybe I can eat 0 things but come on! Why do we not have fat-free cottage cheese? lean beef? real grilled chicken not the baby pieces I am paying for now. Why is it always free pizza at 00 at night complex carb+late night=fat why no free tuna, or free vegetables? why is PROPNAME closed from 0-00:00?! So what if I am not in the friggin weight class I know how to lift better than they do let me in! I worked in a weight room for 0 years you think I can't be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work-in etc? come on want to fight the freshmen 00? get better food! we were ranked last in dorm food LAST LOCNAME should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight. this is outrageous. OK Now that I have ranted and let that out I want to know if there is anything I can do about it. NO there isn't how many students would eat fat-free cottage cheese? or tuna straight from the can? not enough to get the food people to bring it in. Oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy! something just buzzed in my room. my hands are numb spend the a/c $ on some real food!        
__label__label1 As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 00 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK0) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at PROPNAME. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough. I have sympathy for them. I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK0 gives me a headache. I probably will never wear CK0 again. I hope all my friends and family are doing well. I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye. 
__label__label1 right now, I am in a really good mood, I don't really know why because this morning I was so dead, and I thought I would feel like that all day, but I woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but I was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. I don't know how people do it every night!  I am so worn out every day!  I just need to take a few days off to sleep. I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  I have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and I really need to go running, so I hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder I think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. I really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else I would have never woken up. and I really miss my dog. I think I have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god I'm taking psychology. haha I literally miss her more than my parents!  I hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. I always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. I would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! I was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder I was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like I wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and I think that's awesome. sometimes I wish I could be more like that. I am a fairly independent person, but I know I follow the trend a lot too. I hope I do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! I miss dance so much!  I can't believe I quit - I am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when I quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully I can start back up. I seriously think I've gained the freshman 000!  for some reason when I get stressed out I start to eat. a lot. I need to get control!  I think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. I love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. I think I'm kind of in between. I love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!?  he used to be so funny and nice. I wonder what my sister is doing right now. I miss her about the same as I miss my pooch. she is so sweet. I hope she is okay. I worry about her all the time, I just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. I am the complete opposite!  I spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. I know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :(  I really need to stretch. I think running will be good for me today. I need to burn off some steam for sure. I wonder how molly is doing. I haven't talked to her in awhile. I feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and I was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when I call, so I hope she is at least having fun. I bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't I find a guy?  they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which I am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't I get my first choice!  I really want to know what I did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and I am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did I spill my guts that night about it to nathan. I am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run! 
__label__label1 I've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people, using them as test subjects, objectifying human beings, I really feel that it degrades their very being. I don't understand another human's need to study and examine what makes another human tick. I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity, but sadly I am not. I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs, in causes, in religion. They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they're involved in is important, means something, when in reality 000% of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them. None of it will rally matter once these people are gone, and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down, they've all had that thought in their life before. Yet they still go on, slaving their lives away, building the modern day pharaoh's modern day pyramids. Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth. God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations. Which raises another good topic, religion, now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups, just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way. Religion as we know it was made to control the masses, sort of a justification for law, and also something that keeps people inline above law, like a conscience. But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake. We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction. It's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters, as if one is even different that the others, they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy, keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives. In tribal societies religion doesn't have to be forced on the new generation, rather they welcome it with open arms, just as they aren't forced to work in their lives, rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society. People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me, it's clear that people can live, sustain life, off very little, and will slave their lives away rather than die. However I can't comprehend how our society got to this point, where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass. We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones, computers, tv's, cars, when it's a fact that none of these things even existed 00 years ago. People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 0 million years, people just like you and me, people just as smart, and just as naive. It's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around, the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians, but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live, that we have so enlighten found. People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we couldn't live without for nearly 0 million years. But those are all things that no one wants you to know, except maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME. Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it isn't already too late. The doomsday clock is set to 00 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future. If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on. But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life. Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice. So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world. Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all. We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions. But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission. It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here. Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous. People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline. Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore. Anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out, there is no hope for the future we are writing now, at least none that includes us. For a species that holds it self in such hich regard, the top of the food chain, the center of the universe, in our own special classification, we sure act stupidly. If we were to open our eyes we'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions, with drugged up kids, both pharasudically, and illegally, allowing oppression, deforestation, slavery, pollution, and the lot to continue everyday, infact they make sure it grows, because you can't stop progress. They are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save" by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission, so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over. I'm here to tell you that no such place exists, god is just santa clause for adults. Where was god when the twin towers were hit, where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man, where was god when the germans were killing the jews, where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they don't even notice when they're doing it to their own children. I for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land. Everyday we scorch the earth with new roads, we rip the earth apart for new buildings, we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system. No one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here, before civilization no one had to work, in fact tribal people have no concept of work, they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living, doing whatever it is that they want to. We have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable, lazy, pointless, a waste, yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless, just as wasteful. Only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born, because the way we live is so heinous, so vile, so wrong that our children can't handle it, and for the most part neither can we. We could change everything in one generation, if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself, but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right, that this is the way things must be and that there's nothing we can do about it. "People cannot risk being overwhelmed by the anxiety which might accompany a full cognitive and affective grasp of the present world situation and its implications for the future" - PROPNAME     PROPNAME 
__label__label1 what am I supposed to write about?  I can't type right. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow. I need to wash my clothes and do all my homework. Those Rugby Little Sisters are strange girls and they have weird parties. Where's PROPNAME? My roommate is talking to me. She says I need to keep some of my thoughts to myself. I guess maybe that's true. I don't want to do homework. I just want to go to the football game this weekend and not have to worry about grades. I hope that freaky guy isn't going to be at the party on Saturday. He might try something on me again. I like this song, it makes me think of going to LOCNAME. I don't like my Biology 000 professor, she doesn't teach very well and I don't know how I'm supposed to pass her damn class if she keeps jumping around the book and not lecturing about what she needs to lecture about. She is too disorganized. I really need to wash my clothes and I need to workout tomorrow. My foot hurts, though. I really don't feel like running 00 miles tomorrow. That sucks. I wonder what PROPNAME's doing. Probably drinking. I can't wait to go home next month. It's funny, I'm not homesick, but I'm excited to go home. I want to go to LOCNAME. I kind of want to go to LOCNAME. I want to go everywhere. Wow, it's thundering a lot. I hope it doesn't rain on Saturday. I don't really feel like going to the rugby game tomorrow. I really need to study SOMETIME this weekend. sometime other than sunday. I'm so sleepy. I'm sleeping in tomorrow since I don't have class. I'm thirsty. I need to go buy more Diet Dr. Pepper. There just aren't enough hours in a day. I'm mad at PROPNAME. He still hasn't called me and he didn't even say goodbye to me. I thought he was more of a friend than that. Apparently not. Yuck. I need to wash my face and brush my teeth. I feel icky. That girl is STILL on the phone. And she probably wonders why she feels so homesick. Well, maybe if she had get off the phone she would actually have a life here. Being on the phone isn't going to help her at all. She is kind of bitchy too. She is just not friendly at all. Whatever. I hope Aryan's doing okay. Maybe I should call him. It's too late at home, though. Never mind. I have no idea what I want. I just can't let all my exes go. Maybe it's because I'm too immature or something. That's why I needed to get out of LOCNAME, so I could decide what I want with life. Here comes PROPNAME. Okay. I'm sick of the bathrooms here. I want my own bathroom. I hate it. The water here kind of smells funky too. I guess I'm used to more chlorinated water. I need to call PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I hope they get married. PROPNAME's wedding is on Saturday. Wow. She is only 00. I can't imagine being married in two years. That's way too soon. My hair color is awful. I want to go back to that salon and get that bastard to fix it. I mean, I spent a lot of money on crap. I should have told him right off that I hate it. I should be more confrontational. I have that issue. I need to fill up my water filter. I really want something to drink. Good. Only like five more minutes of this. My right shoulder has been hurting lately. It feels as if my vein or artery or whatever is going to burst. I need to get my meningitis vaccination. There's so much to do and I just don't have time to do it. That tickled. Oh! Virgo! That's me. What am I going to do next week for my birthday?  Who is PROPNAME?  Uh oh. 
__label__label0 I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing," but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is going well. I got paid $00 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to "diet" for the next week, though they stress that it's not "diet[ing]," but more "finding a homeostasis" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a ORGNAME box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to ORGNAME for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because ORGNAME is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 0th of may, they don't get out till the 00th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked PROPNAME, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate PROPNAME and I might go visit them up in LOCNAME during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the PROPNAME PROPNAME soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at ORGNAME with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie "The Good Girl" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have. 
__label__label1 I thought I was supposed to set a timer. So I set one, and now I don't think I need it. its actually getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to use correct grammar? I'm not using it at all. I'm typing like I do when I talk to my friends online. I like this song on delilah. I love delilah. why don't others? She seems to always make me in a better mood. Or is it because I like depressing music. I love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. Actually, I think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. I think I cry a lot, but I'm not always depressed. I use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. Do I really like him though? Or am I just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner?  He treats me so well. Was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight?  oh well, I'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. But it bothers me when people don't like me. I miss my best friend lauren. That song today really brought back memories. I love college! I'm pretty much caught up on my work and when I finish this, I'll be even closer to being caught up. There is A LOT of reading u have to do in college. Wow. I hope I don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. I'm just so use to typing like this!  that's not good. I don't like this song right now I wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well I have bout 00 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. In fact, I think it's kind of interesting. What time is adam going to call? I wander if he is almost done with all his homework. I love my parents. I'm glad I talked to them tonight. I feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. I love all the people that are here. Many people thought I wouldn't like all the people, but I actually do!  I'm a big people person I guess. I don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in?  I probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. Oh well. At least I read a chapter of psychology today. I have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. I thought he was going to tell us when to read! I found out he didn't, and now I'm trying to catch up. I can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am I going to wear? I have no idea. maybe I can borrow something from sarah. Do I dress up or not really?  I wander if oscar is going to come or if PROPNAME is. How much is it to get in?  Well I have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. I'm so glad I got seventy dollars back today. what am I going to do with it?  I guess save it until I really need it. I think we need a lil more food in our room. I just don't feel like going to the store. PROPNAME had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us!  Ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. This is awesome! I can type without looking at the keyboard! I've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. I wander how I am going to be creative with my lonestar application. I really really want to make the organization. If I don't I'll be so sad. oh my gosh! I love this song. sure I'll think about you now and then. haha. I was singing. we can do that right? Because I was really singing it in my head. oh man. now I'm starting to feel stupid. Oh well. I wander what other people wrote about. hmm. I wander if I'm doing this right?  ok I'm tired of sitting up straight. I'm so full. I think I need to stop eating so much! But I really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when I say I don't like being so skinny? Skinny people always get teased. I want to weigh at least 000, and since I have come to college I weigh 0 pounds more. 000. ok my time is almost up. YAYYYY now all I have left to do is read and finish my application. Oh man. I have to get my shot tomorrow! 
__label__label1 Damn, I'm really hungry. My girlfriend was really hungry too, so she came over to make some Spaghetti. I guess it's already almost 0pm, so dinner wouldn't be a bad thing. In fact, it would be a good thing. It's pretty hot outside today. I have a horrible crick in my neck. Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled. When I look to the left, it all seems to go away. Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms. I should start studying more often. I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today. not like I was terribly worried about it though. I had my first quiz at LOCNAME today as well. I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business. I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them. If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz. It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified ORGNAME and ORGNAME network administrator. My roommate PROPNAME has been really sketchy lately. I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships. DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good. It's making my mouth start to water really bad. I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention. I also have a double PROPNAME's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat. I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 000 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these. My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music. Oop--now it's picking up again. I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor. Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch. The code to their ranch was 0000, because that's the year they purchased it. The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name. This sucks that the time is going by so slowly. At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 00 seconds. The spaghetti is ready. Damnit, I'm hungry but I have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one. I wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color. Maybe because it looks similar to gold -- and gold is a precious commodity. My stomach feels like it's burning right now. Those aromas are filling my nose. WOOOOO HOOOOO! My girlfriend, PROPNAME, just brought me a plate full of Spaghetti and Meatballs.  to have a bite  As much as I really want to sit here and keep typing, I think I'm going to grab a drink to pair with my spaghetti. Dr Pepper is pretty awesome. I can type and watch TV at the same time. I never thought being able to type without looking would be that good of a thing Now I get to use it while trying to complete my psychology assignment. Yeeeaaaah! The assignment is over. 
__label__label1 this writing assignment is very interesting. it is strange how it is somewhat difficult to simply write whatever I am thinking. sometimes it is hard to tell. I really need to catch up on some of my homework. I also need to find a job. high school was so much different than college is. that isn't necessarily a bad thing. just different. I like living in LOCNAME. there is much more to do than there is in a town of under 000 people. I am hungry. where should I eat lunch today. my parents are coming down this weekend. I think I'll leave. to many people in a little apartment. I don't really think I could handle it. I got a cat. well a kitten actually. to keep my company. it whines a lot. and likes to crawl up my leg. I haven't really talked to that many people from back home since I have been here. but that doesn't really bother me. I need new people. meeting people here is harder than I thought it would be. I figured since this is a huge campus that it would be easy and just kind of happen. but it turns out I think I might actually have to make an effort to meet new people. I really need to find a job. hopefully on-campus. that would be great. I am looking forward to psychology class today. it is interesting. I want to learn how people think. because I wish I knew a lot of the time. but I don't really think that is something you can learn. because everyone's mind works differently, so how can you learn how people think if it not the same with any one person?  how can you know the emotions and thoughts of the people around you?  I have a hard time knowing the thoughts and emotions of my closest friends. and even myself at times. the mind is so complex. I have thought about majoring in psychology. I just wish I had some clue as to what I want to do with my life. it's like I am here, in college, finally, and I have no idea what to do with it. I guess I will figure it out. I just get tired of waiting for that sudden thought to just pop into my head and me know that is what I want to do for the rest of my life. that's a long time. I want to do something I enjoy. somewhere where I will be happy. but I guess that is what everybody wants. but why do some people find that, and not others. what makes the lucky ones different. I guess if everyone did what the wanted then there would be nobody to do the dirty work. but it just seems unfair that some have it so could. and some can never find that place where they feel content. does that place really exist? I think so. I don't think I have quite found it though. I think I will though. maybe I'll be one of those lucky ones. I miss PROPNAME. is this going to work?  do I want it to?  I do but there are so many things to experience here. will it change me? he thinks so. but I don't know. maybe it will. maybe it should. but where does that leave us? is there an us?  I have no idea how to handle that situation. my parents are going crazy. they miss me so much. I miss them, but am relieved to not be in there household anymore. I needed some freedom. I need to learn to live on my own. I really don't want a job though. it will be hard to balance work and school and homework. but I need to money. I guess I have to eat and pay rent. I am really getting hungry. I am not really that tired considering I got up at 0 this morning. surprising. I haven't even taken a nap. I don't think I will. I rode the shuttle from my apartment this morning. I usually drive. but I can't afford to pay $0 everyday. it wasn't that bad. but I didn't really know where it was going to take me. but I made it to class on time. and didn't have to walk that far. I just hope I am able to catch it this afternoon. I think I know where it will pick me up. but I don't know what time it runs really. and how late it runs. but I should be done here around 0. cause I have a class from 0:00 till 0. I really need to go to the gym. I think I am going to talk some dance classes. that sounds like fun. and I bet it will help me meet more people. I need to talk to PROPNAME. let him know I care and that I think about him a lot. I know he worries. I worry to. I need to quit stressing about everything so much. I worry myself to much. I guess that is human nature though. who knows what human nature really is. maybe that is just an excuse for the way we act. I know I use it as an excuse at times. that's kind of sad. but I guess everyone probably does. wow my times almost up. that didn't seem like 00 minutes. when you just start letting your thoughts go I guess time goes by pretty quickly. I think I might take a nap. but I have more homework that needs to be done. dang there is so much reading. I get tired  
__label__label0 I just failed my chemistry quiz. I feel . depressed?  I could have gotten the correct answer it was just that I was answering the question incorrectly. At first I thought it was the LOCNAME's fault, maybe she done the test wrong. But as I was turning in the quiz I finally realized that I had been solving for the wrong question. Hey there's a squirrel with a piece of pizza that is bigger than him !! Ha-ha, cute. Anyways, I was turning in the quiz when I realized this. Oh well it was too late anyways. I wonder if that's how it feels when you die and go to heaven and actually realize you were praying for the wrong person or to no one at all. Just a waste of time. There's a lot of people around here, thank you the group of people that came up with wireless internet. There's really nothing much going around in my mind right now, except for the whole feeling guilty/depressed for failing that chem quiz. I went to the HPO to pick up the application for the JAMP program they want at least a 0. 00 gpa and 0. 0 gpa in the science areas in order to be admitted into it. I already failed my chem quiz , what to do. I have a test next week in chemistry, hopefully I will learn from my previous mistakes in my quiz and I will get an A . PROPNAME, squirrels they are so funny and cute, they are everywhere around this campus, that's what I love about it here, the whole not so dirty as LOCNAME thing going on . Its so clean , well around here it is still haven't seen the rest of LOCNAME. I bet squirrels back at home wouldn't even come up this close as the ones in here do,  What is love. I have been thinking about that , I want to believe my practical side and think that it is nothing but a bunch of hormones hitting your pleasure area in the brain. Or that love is just conformity, you find someone stay with them because you never want to be alone again. Or is love really something else, do we stay alive for it?  Is it really forever even after you die?  Maybe that's just something we want to believe in because we are also afraid of being alone even after we die. Do we really need love to be happy?  I mean love as in an "only one" your significant other, do we really need that kind of love to be happy in life , or is it really just another experience we go through?  What is love to women?  Are they just trying to find another paternal figure in their life in order to replace the one they had when they were young?  I mean think about it, if a girl had a bad experience with her dad, she'd view all men the same. So lets say she lost her respect for him, we'll she then lose respect for all men? Will she be able to be in a healthy relationship?  All these questions, and I can't type fast. I'm a slow typer. But yeah, why are we here anyways. Is life nothing but insignificant events that happen in no random order and were really just nothing at all. I mean I'm sure if all of humanity died, the earth would still spin, maybe the earth will be better with out all of us. Sometimes we think we are the center of the universe. But really we are nothing at all, just a speck in the abyss of the dark universe. Ew, there was some stuff on my hands where did it come from. Maybe a bird pooped on me, you can't trust those birds. I rubbed it all over my forehead, maybe I should check what it is, wait I have to finish this thing. I'm thinking about majoring in some other field now, like psychology, but I love my current HAHAHAHA there is a squirrel in the trash can !! HOW CUTE. So psychology sounds interesting buy I also looooooooove biology. Maybe there's a biopsychology major out there, I mean biology and psychology do go in hand right? 
__label__label0 It smells really good in my apartment. My roommate's girlfriend is making chicken and I'm cooking out. I love Monday night football. Its on tonight. it is Thursday night but this is the opening game but abc is covering the game. watching football is putting me in a good mood. I am in the process of cooking out on the grill. I'm really tired right now but I have a test tomorrow. last night I had like three hockey games. on real game and then the school team, we had practice. we got a new dog and it sometimes keeps me up at night. he is a jack russel terrier and his name is miller. the washing machine is going and it is really loud. just like the dishwasher. the patriots are winning now they just kicked a field goal. my girlfriend is doing her homework over in the dining room. I wonder what she is working on. the dishwasher stopped and now it is quiet in here. john madden annoys me. I'm not really watching the game because I'm doing this but I hear him commenting on the game. all he does is state the obvious. I don't need to hear him tell me what I just saw. I can believe he gets paid. I hope I get a good job like that were I get paid very well and the job can be fun. it just got really hot in my apartment really fast. I need to turn down the thermostat. I don't want to study tonight. I just want to chill. I am worrying occasionally because I changed my major and I am now trying to get into upper division. my new major is sport management. it used to be economics. a beer would great right now. I just saw a ORGNAME light commercial. that's good advertising. well I'm halfway done with this thing. there is not much to say I just keep thinking of the same things. I hope LOCNAME football wins this weekend. LOCNAME beat us last year but I think we will beat them this year. I need to go put the meat on the grill because I am hungry. I have to do this for 0 more minutes then I can do that. I'm cooking this really good sausage that my girlfriend bought in Elgin, LOCNAME. I'm so hungry. its making it worse because of my roommates food that they are making is smelling really good. hopefully the patriots will win this game. they are winning this game. they won last year in the conference championship. I'm ready for the hockey season to start. I wish I could go play hockey tonight. I wonder what my dog is doing. my roommate is yelling at him so I'm sure he is doing something mischievous because he is always doing stuff like that. be quiet john madden. this is a long twenty minutes. I'm still hungry. I'm ready for the weekend. it will be fun. dang the patriots are punting. I need a new car. mine is a 0 door PROPNAME that is a 00 so it is eleven year old. I can't wait till next Wednesday for the incubus concert. they are my favorite band and they are coming to Austin to play. it will be sweet. I'm going with all my friends. I should call my mom and let her know what is going on with me I wonder what she is doing 
__label__label0 I really miss PROPNAME. she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how I don't have my cell phone here with me. my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail Saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until Monday and I wont get it until Thursday before I leave to go to LOCNAME. I'm drawing a blank. how am I supposed to write for twenty minutes when I'm struggling to think of something to write after only two. I guess I shouldn't think so hard, should I. is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway. I'm really enjoying this psychology class. I thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it PROPNAME is actually a really energetic professor. I like that. it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us. kind of reminds me of Brink, my science teacher in high school. he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us. I do not know one person in ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME or one person who came through CHS and had PROPNAME that didn't like him or his approach to teaching. I miss him. I miss high school. college life is really overwhelming at times. Right now I'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy. I partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone. Oh nikki couldn't handle that big school. She got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there. Look at little miss I'm smarter than you back in LOCNAME. I guess it was lonely up there on her high horse. I have to be a success and that is why I have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester. it is so important that I become somebody. I can't stress that enough. I refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves. its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so. My family is a bunch of nobodies and I hate to say that. Well in an educational sense of the term. None of them went off to school in order to better themselves. but then again I can't really blame them for that. I mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance. I'm here on financial aid as it is. its not easy walking in my shoes. some people think I have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges I had to overcome to get here. it was not an easy road to tow. I been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of God. Speaking of God I miss PROPNAME and ORGNAME and Tristan. I only wish that I had more time with them before they left. especially PROPNAME. He was and still is my baby. I love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me. they could have left but why him. I remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when I first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no. that was my little boy. I love him and miss him like  you would never understand or maybe you would because I'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine I loved him like he was. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm writing about the things I am thinking of. I just got my hair cut and now I'm drinking a coke float. which I probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 00 is a big thing these days. my boyfriend just called and I like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes I just wonder like if I'm doing the right thing. actually I wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived. now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 00 years - that's a long time. I'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents. today I went and bought some clothes, which I probably should not have because I have a lot already. this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this. today we had a parade in my home town. yeah I'm home again. and it was cool. PROPNAME is a senior. I wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie. today is the football game, I wonder if LOCNAME will win. ORGNAME lost really bad last night - LOCNAME their not as good as they think they are. mom is sleeping and she snores a lot. dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting. coolcherrychick has just signed on. cool. lol wow my hair is really short. man I can type faster than I thought I could, I guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! I can't believe I found pants long enough for me at ORGNAME, that like never happens because I have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal. now coolcherrychick has just signed off. why do I like coke so much? I mean I don't drink it that often because I don't allow myself to, but I do enjoy it a lot - I guess the caffeine. I have problems spelling. this coke float is super good. thank god he stopped. ha-ha I just wrote stuffed before I erased it, anyway with the window. my hair is really cute, at least I think so. for once I'm not cold, its amazing. rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least I will have a coach forcing me to work out and I can identify with a team. I wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, I mean I can use big words, but I really don't think in big words. my cognate. however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that. I hope rhea's oh regina's home, I hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, I don't think she really tried very hard but I mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible. regina and laurie just got home and as I'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something I don't know and I feel bad but I have to do this assignment. oh well I hope they didn't think I was being rude. this is kind of hard because I think so much faster than I type. mija just ran with laurie. she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but I guess I do to when I don't take a bath for awhile. I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it. PROPNAME called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 00 something but looks a lot younger. like 00 or 00 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general. I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer. I like that song and I can't believe a 00 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself. PROPNAME is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it. I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it. I mean I can jump high, but I can't hit hard. wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, I am glad I am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow I really have problems typing. today I changed in the car, that was really not fun I should have planned it better. oh well I guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking. usa wow I'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices. shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time. it would be so nice to be rich. I need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol. breathing is a good thing. laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun. my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.    
__label__label0 Hey what's up? I just got home from school and hopefully I can finish doing this before my sister gets home and takes over the computer. Today was cool I got my hair cut finally and the girl that did it was really sweet. I wish my hair was thicker though. I'm trying to type as fast as I can in twenty minutes so I'm wondering how much I'll really end up typing. I can't wait to go to college station this weekend. I hope mom doesn't find out that I ran into that pole in the garage. I think I'm just going to tell her that a car must have hit it. I have the story all planned out and everything. I'd much rather drive PROPNAME's car to college station this weekend. I can't wait to see PROPNAME again. He's so awesome. I had so much fun at LOCNAME's last night, Minus the Bear rocked. Sometimes I feel out of place at that place though because it seems like everyone is trying to hard to look like they don't want to go crazy when the band is playing. I'm so happy they played my favorite song, too. I was surprised how many LOCNAME people were there too. I think PROPNAME is so cute too! I haven't seen PROPNAME in a while that was surprising. I wonder if she still thinks I'm a bitch for all that crap in high school. I'm starting to realize that LOCNAME isn't as fun as I thought it'd be. It's a crazy place to live, but after being in College Station all I think about is how fun it'd be to live there. There's so many teenagers and so much to do at night. The cat's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water. I think I hurt it when he flew off the table. I'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here. I can't remember the last time I ate at the same time PROPNAME did. Hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off. Which doesn't really matter anyways since there's no place to park without having to pay five dollars. I don't like going to Eco class very much. I feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and I have no idea what he's talking about. I haven't even been reading as much as I thought I would in school. Maybe I should start too because it'll probably start to get hard and then I really won't know what anyone's talking about. I always wonder if PROPNAME is getting tired of me. I know he always thinks about getting with another girl, but I'd really like to see what he does and how he is when he's all drunk at some party. That's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and PROPNAME fit in with them pretty good I think. I know I should have joined that one group but I think I just wanted to know someone in it before I did. I don't think I could ever afford to pay that much money anyways. I can't even hold on to a hundred in a week. I need to stop buying so many clothes but there's too many cute things I want. I can't wait to get regular cable, these channels suck. I think me and Austin will last a long time, we don't fight at all, so maybe being far away can be a good thing. I bet a lot of people think I'm stupid for staying with him 
__label__label1 I'm glad I'm doing this assignment right now, I can't wait until Friday so I can get hammered That's the guy that was eying me like I was going to steal something it's kind of hot outside I wonder if I should change before we go to PROPNAMEnigins tonight. Did I spell PROPNAME's right?  I hope I did the second time. Young Buck is a good lyricist. It's too bad he doesn't get that much shine. I feel like I'm going to get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from all this typing. General, I salute. ORGNAME ORGNAME is good too. Damn, It's already seven o'clock and I'm just barely getting started on homework!  This running nose sucks. I picked a hell of a time to do this. I don't know why I get sick so often. I'd be great if I had health insurance. Why is that fool looking at me like that. What does he think I'm going to do?  He just doesn't know. Damn my muscles are so sore and I'm so tired. I got a good workout today. I like to reflect on my day towards the end, It's just what I do. Shit what the fuck do I do now?  I lost track, but now I'm back on track like a train. The Little Engine that Could is what you COULD call me. LOL that was so lame!  Why is Ben laughing?  I don't why I'm writing the dumbest shit. I'm pretty smart. I must be, I got into UT. Hook 'Them Horns!  Get off the phone!  Stop talking. What's up?  What's up?  What's Up?  PROPNAME!   They don't know me up in here. Who do you love?  I love myself. I got sunshine on a cloudy day, when It's cold outside, I got the month of May. Too bad it's on September. Just two more weeks and I turn 00. That's going to be crunch, yaw know. Hell yeah!  My nose is stopping to run. There are a lot of hot girls in my Psych class. Shit, there better be, there's fucking 000 plus people in that class. Why do people look at me funny. I think it's the way I dress. Just thuggin it up. Oh hold up dog, you better let me in. Fuck that let's get in started come on, let's begin. I don't even know what to say next. I smoke everyday because I stay stressed. And stay dressed, fly fresh to death, head to toe until the day I rest. Just give me some air forces and fitted hat to match matter of fact give me two of those with a white new era, now who dares to. Even approach me. I'm known in the ORGNAME, but in H-Town it's locally, express myself vocally cause I fight with words I ain't the one wild in out stay tight on curbs swerve right in burb, high like them birds. I'm feeling kind of lucky, you could call me PROPNAME, you call me anything. PROPNAME I don't ball with jokes so you could me anything, just don't call me broke. Most hated M to the is-h phenomenal get up and get straight in your abdominal I'm warning you, stop your blood clot, and keep your mouth shut, stop talking shit you don't know what I'm about OK now I'm back, used to be little, but now I'm stacked like change on the dresser and spot the fakes, the streets is like a jungle you got to watch these snakes, cause they'll come up and bite yaw, act like they like yaw, pour gasoline on yaw then ignite yaw, start the fire, just like PROPNAME, my pockets fill with money just like Banks and dating girls who model, just like Banks 
__label__label0      I went to church tonight. It makes me feel very calm and relaxed. It puts the world into such a different perspective. Everything seems so simple. It makes me want to be a much better person. The television is on. I think it's on ORGNAME. I'm not watching it though. That's annoying song on that commercial. I don't want to go back to school on Tuesday. I have a lot of work to do including reading for this class. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town. I hate commercials. I don't like eating college food. I really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat. My roommate went home for the weekend. It's weird being here alone. I have been going to sleep late this weekend. I turned off the TV. I went to the football game last night. It was fun. There was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol. It makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in. It's very quiet. I want to join clubs here. I really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center. I want to make a difference that way. I'm really hungry so I am eating burnt popcorn. I will prob. make some more after I finish this. I don't know what the point of this is. I think it's a cool assignment, but I wonder what it is going to show about the way I think. I want my boyfriend to call. I miss him a lot. I saw my friends today. I bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them. They are really cute. My boyfriend is from LOCNAME. It just occurred to me that I'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z. I'm a horrible speller. The tower was so pretty last night. I think it is my favorite part of campus. I look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it. I love it. I like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower. They're just really cool. I think I hear one of my suite mates. She went to visit her boyfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wish my boyfriend was closer. It's hard having him so far away. I know everything will work out though because I love him so very much. Wow. I can't wait till Friday. It was really cool visiting him in LOCNAME. My dad's birthday is coming up on the 00th. That is also PROPNAME and I's 0 month anniversary. Wow. that's a long time. I want to marry him. That may sound weird. too soon or whatever. But it's true. I never thought I would find someone so amazing. He told me that he wants to marry me someday. I wish that I could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again. I went to this meeting on studying abroad on Friday. It was pretty boring. It was interesting how many countries you can go to. I want to do that one day. That would be fun to experience another culture. I mean I've been to LOCNAME before but only for a couple of weeks. Not long enough to learn about it in-depth. I have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends. It's kind of sad. Especially this weekend. I'm surprised how many people left. I love the picture of my baby next to my printer. He's so adorable. He makes me feel so special. I'm thirsty. Why isn't my boyfriend calling me? I love the sound of his voice. I forgot that I wanted to call my mom today. I wanted to tell her about the game and find out about PROPNAME. I hope she is alright. The priest at church prayed for the people in LOCNAME. I'm happy that PROPNAME goes to church now. My friend once told me that she didn't believe in God. I hope she does now. I almost started crying in church because I was so happy. I like when my boyfriend goes to church with me. He's such a better person now that he's going out with me. It's amazing how much he's changed. He stopped drinking. Not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend. He wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot. I want to talk to my friend ben. He's at ORGNAME. Wow. 00 minutes is a long time. I can't believe I'm still writing. It's getting pretty boring. I don't know what else to think about. I miss my nephews they are so cute. I don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion. That's so incredibly sad. I hope I can help put an end to abortions one day. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I really don't like analynn. Goodness she is very mean and fat. I'm glad that I never have to see her. 
__label__label1      I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal. You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about. I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out. 
__label__label1 WELL, I FINALLY GOT TO MY WRITING FOR PSY. I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TODAY OFF. MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 0:00 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 000.      MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME. THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR. MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW. I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW PROPNAME IS LOCKED IN JAIL. EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T. PROPNAME IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE. THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND PROPNAME IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 000 YEARS AGO. SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC. SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ORGNAME. IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 0 MINUTES. 00 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY. I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY. I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME. I MISS IT. THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE. LIKE ORGNAME, ORGNAME SPORT, ORGNAME ORGNAME AND BLACK MARKET, ORGNAME. I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS. I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 00 IN THE AFTERNOON.       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER. HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO. I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT. I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME. I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY. I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE. I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON. WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY. IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND. 
__label__label1 Autumn will be here soon. I wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city. Down. Down the elivator once again, floor 00, now floor 0. I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath. That single inhale was a day, was a life. Old postcards line my smile. I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess. Heart or head, it doesn't matter. but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching. My little fan is growling at me. It's probably upset that I always leave it on. Let me turn it off really quick. Ok. Done. I heard a door shut. The people in my dorm are an infestation. I cannot STAND them. I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same. Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look. Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. I LOOK at the people. They make me laugh! We are so strange. I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls. People who try to look sexy. People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. People look at me too. What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. My heart races when they do that. It's kind of a love. I love them for that one milisecond. I understand them for one lapse of time. But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me. That's my job. I absolutely hate being in here. Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books. entertainment is all I need on media terms. We should kill our TV's though. As one of my favorite bands says "I wish the world was flat like the old days". I have to say: Amen. We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking. 
__label__label0 Let's see. I'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. This is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. Not that she's not a cool person or anything, I just can concentrate better when I'm alone and when it is quiet. But that is almost impossibe here in Jester. There are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. Like right now!  Oh well, it is something I must get used to. Or I can do what I did last night. Wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. I stayed there until 0:00 a. M. I guess I can do my work better at night. My fingers are freezing!  This room is so cold!  I haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. I'm cold even when I go to bed at night with my blanket. I have to constantly keep a sweater on and I cannot wear shorts like I used to back at home. Aw, home!  I think I am starting to miss being at home. I called the house the other day and my 00-year old brother told me he misses me. This, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. I do go back home on Thursday night, but only so that I can get to the LOCNAME airport Friday morning for my flight to LOCNAME. I am competing in a sports tournament for my church. I am playing flag football and running track. Another cool thing about this weekend get away is that I get to see the guy I've been dating for less than a month. Well, I've known him for about 0 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. It's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 00. I went to a dance with him after that, but only because I didn't want to be mean. He is exactly a year and 00 days younger than me. That was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, I really don't care anymore. He is the sweetest and funniest guy I have ever met. I actually just got out of a 0 year and 0 month relationship a month ago. Me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. A week after we broke things off, this new guy I'm dating told me he had feelings for me. I was so confused and didn't know what to do because I had just got out of a relationship and I was going to be moving to LOCNAME in a few weeks. But I'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. Because of that, I decided that I'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. We decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. My ex found out and was extremely jealous. It just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. But oh well, that's life I guess. I am really glad I continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. I spent every day with him until the day I left. I have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. He is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. I mean I did just get out of a serious relationship and I don't think I'm quite ready for another one. That's the only problem I'm having right now. The fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. But the distance might become an issue. It was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so I do feel a tad bit guilty that I'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. But my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. But yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ORGNAME. But I am definitely loving it here in LOCNAME. I enjoy all of my professors and classes. Having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. In addition I am taking this psychology class, which I dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. Other than that I have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. I just finished the reading for that class right before I started this assignment. Ah, my hands are still so cold. What do I do?!  My ears are feeling very cold too. Must I wear gloves in the summer in my DORM ROOM?!  Or my bad, it is the fall now. Same thing. Today is the day for my mile run. Ever since I moved to LOCNAME, I have been running a mile every other day at the Gregory Gym. I absolutely love that place!  And it is so convenient because it is right next to Jester. Freshman 00 can kiss my booty because I am staying in shape!  I find that I've been working out more here than I was doing at home in the summer. I really love this lifestyle I have at LOCNAME. The whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but I do not feel like I am abusing it. I did party a lot this weekend, but I didn't drink or anything. People keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. I don't want people to view me as a party girl because I'm not out of control or anything. Oh well. I see that this writing is almost up. That wasn't too bad! 
__label__label0 At 000 I should be done writing this paper!!! I am so excited that I get to go home and see my man today. So my body really hurts right now but I feel great because I have worked out every day for like the past week and now I think I am addicted to working out. it gives me such a rush and whoa!!!!! someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me. I hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating. We have designated quiet hours in the dorm AND THERE THEY GO AGAIN!!! no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala I really feel like dancing I think it would be cool it is funny how my typing can't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all I can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it is that I have to do it for 00 minutes which I originally thought would be a short period of time but I look at the clock right now and it says 000 which means it is time to smoke. Lol that is if I smoked weed which I don't I actually find that to be so stupid. why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life. Sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have. psychology is such an interesting major. I just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems, surprisingly, like it will be a lot of fun! I am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that I can cut it I just hope I maintain my GPA and can be like what now! I love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once I finish it is the best feeling kind of like the "high" I get when I exercise I need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale I am excited to be going home to see my b/f but I really don't want to see my family that is probably the one thing I don't miss all that arguing I can't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me is my relationship with my man. he is older I know and I do love him or at list I think I love him and I would never want to hurt him , but I am scared about settling down after college for so many years I saw college as being the perfect time to party and meet boys, but now it isn't like that I LOVE TO FLIRT but I have someone that cares about me and that I care about but I just don't know to I want to settle down with someone that doesn't even have a high school diploma. I'm scared he's going to end up using me or something stupid like that. I know that is mean but so far he doesn't keep his promises to me and he lies and I pay for EVERYTHING but it doesn't matter he  will pay me $000 I think I have spent over $0000 on our relationship. Going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks. Oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 00 minutes of my life I am starting to get typer's cramp. Is that possible? well staring at this screen sure isn't helpful at all!! I am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first I have to wait to finish this paper THEN I got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile. I wonder what I'm going to wear I want to wear my brown shoes but do I have anything natural colored to go along with it I have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm I really should look would white go ummm I need to paint my toenails!!! I can so do that when I get back from eating actually I think naw I do them when I get back look only 0 and a half more minutes I think my roommate is back nope someone else I wonder where she is because her class got out at 0 but normally she comes back early. I really hope I make the crew team I think that would be so cool. I want to make a team And feel special just something else to tell myself that I can do it everyone keeps saying because I am tall but it will be a whole new experience because I know nothing about the sport man I need to brush my teeth what can wear damn I got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that to the list so many things to do this weekend I think I'm going to take summer courses yay! almost finished 0. 0. 0 
__label__label0 Today has been so uneventful. I just accidentally pushed the finish button on this thing and I hadn't typed a thing. My roommate has her volume all the way up on her computer and is IMing people and it is quite annoying. *Bahhhring!* Ugh. I just watched this movie that I completely did not understand. I'm not sure exactly what was going on the whole time. Something about this guy who was really screwed up and then he killed his mom. But she wanted him to. Weird. I'm so tired right now, but I have an early 0 o'clock class. I have towels in the drier. I can't forget to take them out. They're pink and have my name monogramed on them in bright green. Cute. I think, anyways. I can't stop thinking about PROPNAME. I hate being in a long distance relationship. I really do. I saw him just yesterday, and he is coming to visit again on Saturday, but it is still too much time in between. I just miss him so much. He means everything to me. HeORGNAME my best friend. He's my boyfriend. He's everything. I feel like I don't talk to my mom as much as I should, but I really don't feel compelled. And when I do talk to her, she always thinks I am upset about something, but I'm not. I just don't have a lot to say. She is usually busy anyways. Any forty-one-year-old with a kid in college and a one and a half year old, and a live-in, senile grandmother generally has a lot on her plate. And my step-dad, not like he counts for anything. I can't stand the man. And she wonders why I was always miserable when I lived with her. He's such a jerk. But I don't have to live with him now. College life is so much different, but I think I will like it, aside from being away from PROPNAME. I like being on my own and not having to worry about what every one else thinks all the time. Especially my step-dad. I do miss PROPNAME though. Seeing him this weekend was so amazing. I had only been away from him for a week, but it seemed like an eternity longer, I guess because we had taken this huge leap in our lives, moving away and all. I still can't believe it. My life at home was always so monotomous. Get dressed, school, newspaper, home, dinner, PROPNAME, home, computer, sleep. Day in, day out. Now all I do is homework, but still, it's a change (haha, like I ever did homework in high school!) I just realized that I can finally type without looking at the keys. I hadn't known that before. Of course, now that I notice this, I keep messing up, but I guess that's because I am concentrating too hard. I'm trying to teach my mom to type not in all capital letters all the time. That's so annoying. Of course, now she types in all lower case, but still that's a step up from reading EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Caps hurt my eyes and run together. Wow, this really is a random paper. I went to ORGNAME this weekend. I could never go to that school. They have chapel every morning at 0. Wow, that's early. And they have community bathrooms. And, their dorms are small. I like my dorm at PROPNAME. It's nice and spacious, for a dorm anyhow. A whole lot better than Jester. I would hate to live in that cramped little space. Gross. And their bathrooms are gross because ditzy little girls are always getting too drunk and puking everywhere. Oh, the life a sorority hopeful. How I envy puking all over the place in front of everyone. My suitemate puked this weekend because she got too drunk. I've never been drunk, don't plan on being that way. It just doesn't appeal to me. In the cafeteria they had corn nuggets. PROPNAME and I were talking about those just the other day. They used to have them at ORGNAME's ORGNAME and we both loved them, but now they don't anymore. But they have them in the cafeteria! That's about the only decent thing they have. Unless you're into greasy casserole or soggy bagels. I for one am not. I am so sleepy, and I think I might go to bed early tonight. But I need to remember my towels in the dryer. I bet they'll turn the next person's laundry pink, but hopefully not. I've washed them before. I need to call PROPNAME after I get done with this. I told him I'd call when PROPNAME left. PROPNAME's gone. I bet he is busy though. His classes began today. Oh, man. I miss him and talk about him way too much. Is that bad? I really think we can make it though. I mean, if the world is like it should, he and I will be together. We just will. Every time I look down at the beautiful ring on my finger, (on my RIGHT hand), I just know it'll be okay. But I do miss him. I transferred into Comm school today. PROPNAME says I am a Commie now, just like her. I guess this is something to be happy about. This is what I've wanted for a long time. Oh, my time is almost up. Wow, twenty minutes goes fast when you don't talk about anything but yourself. Shameless self-infatuation. 
__label__label0 ahh everyting I typeed got erased dammit I have to do this again. htat is not fair I am angry now, with 00 seconds left somehow everything I typed about got erased. that is very frustrating for me I typed about so many random things. let me try this again. First of all I talked about how I am leaving for LOCNAME in the mornging. I have a flight at 0 oclock which means I have to leave my house at 000 in the mornign so I can get there half an hour before my boarding of my flight. my dad is going to take me to the airport so I odnt have to leave my car there. I have not seen my car in two weeks and I love my car. I bought the car with my own money and I paid for it for one whole year. now my dad pays for it and is thaankful that I atleast got about 00000 dollars out of the way of the payments. I bought my car on august 00 0000 and to celebrate my two year anniversary I ended up having to get my wisdom teeth pulled. it was actuall fun for me. I loved the laughing gas, it made me so goofy I amde so many jokes with my partetns and with my docotors. I also couldnot stop laughing. also I did not feel any pain but still took pain killers to make sure that the pain didn't kick in. lets see what else can I talk about. hmm. I am waiting for my shoes to get mailed in to my house. I ordered some nike shox which I got to customize the color and also got to write my nAME ON IT. oops I had caps lock on. that is wiered, I am still mad that my whole assignment got erased right before it was twenteyy miutes. oh well htere is always things runnging around in my mind. if I am ever bored I turn to sports. I love sports. I love ut sports and all of dallas' temas. I will support them 000 percent everrytime. most of the time my TV is on I watch espn, it is an awesome channel, okay it has benn twenty minutes of typing for me so I am goign to go pack for my trip. hopefully I can get an A in this class. and I love this assignment 
__label__label0 This is a very interesting homework assignment. I wish the rest of my assignments were this interesting. I am a home right now. I can home for the weekend. It has been two weeks since I left for college and I came home. I know it is not recommended to do this but I did. I don't think it will affect me. The only thing is that I don't want to see my mom cry again. That is the worst part. I love typing, it is so much easier than writing by hand. I have not spoken to my two best friends. One of them I am kind of upset at because she is so infatuated with a guy that she blew her two best friends off. That really hurt my feelings. Wow, only two minutes have gone by. I wonder if I am going to have enough things to write about for twenty minutes. Doing the assignment for this class reminds of the class and the cute guys in the class. I have so much homework and I started to work on it at noon, but it is chemistry and it was difficult. I got very frustrated. I also had a lot of distractions. For example, I brought home two weeks worth of laundry and I have been doing all the loads since I woke up and had breakfast. That was about ten this morning. I wonder what is happening down in LOCNAME. It feels weird not to be there, and when I am there, it feels weird not to be there. I wonder what is happening at the Castilian. What is laundry boy doing?  Is he doing his laundry again. It feels so good to be close to my mom and getting her cooking. She is the best cook in the world. My sister's birthday is tomorrow and I am glad I got her her present early. My mom and dad came home with her presents today and she is really excited. My mom gave her her present and it was what she wanted. She was given the chance to get dad's present early too, but she decided to wait. The big game is about to start and I am contemplating about watching it. I really wish I would get around to doing my homework. I have been really bad at managing my time lately. I checked my loan status and everything has been approved. Thank God. Yes I will be in debt forever, but right now the important thing is to get an education at the place of my choice. I have to pay off debts that are roaming around. If I have money left over, I want to buy myself a lap top computer. It is so different how everything at LOCNAME is so technologically advanced. Is that how it is on other campuses. The big game is tonight. I wonder if I will ever get around to going to a football game. I think maybe for the experience. I sister was disgusted by something on TV. I can hear the dryer. It has been going almost all day. I had a lot of clothes to wash. How am I going to make time to do laundry. I think since I was instructed by mom to wait until I came home, that is why it piled up. I think I will do it weekly in LOCNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing right now?  What is she thinking about the issue?  Does she know what is going on?  I really want to talk to her, but I will not look for her. I think it is her responsibility to see what made us feel bad. I think I have justifiable reasons to be mad at her. Wow, the time is almost up. I thought I was going to be dragging this on and on. I was just thinking of the ride home yesterday. I almost made a driving mistake that could have cost me. There were so many cars. Since I have not been driving in LOCNAME, it was weird. I tried leaving LOCNAME right as the schools had let out and there was a big traffic jam on I-00. I was crazy. I was just inching along. It took me about an hour to make it out of LOCNAME. My dad is such a goof ball. He was telling me how things are just not the same without me here at home. Everyone is really emotional. My text books were so expensive. I am still blown away by the prices. Then yesterday I had to buy a stupid calculator. I had a quiz and could not use a graphing one. 
__label__label1      Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far. Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade. Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe. I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends. At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town. Good old LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there. My roommate is also from LOCNAME LOCNAME the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on. Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well. Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt. Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there. But well back to my life in college. I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it. Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper. Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP. This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend PROPNAME showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at ORGNAME's. Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and PROPNAME didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 0 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in. So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town. I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit. When I was there it was fun the first couple of 00 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates. But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose. My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving. Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give. The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast. And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer. 
__label__label1 I got home from LOCNAME today from hunting and it wasn't that great. The dove weren't flying when I was there maybe its because I'm bad luck. Sometimes I think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before I got there then when I got there I didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else. Super smells really good right now I think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs. Sounds really good because I'm so hungry I haven't eaten all day. Speaking of not eating all day I just realized how fun my weekend was. That's why I haven't really eaten that much. Food sounds so good. Friday night I went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in. Even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in. I'm pissed. From now on when I have a party I'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls. Some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool. Anyway, then I went to the LOCNAME game on Saturday and we stomped all over LOCNAME LOCNAME. I kind of felt bad but not really. Its weird to be at a ORGNAME game and say "this is my school. "  I'm so used to being in high school and going to high school games I'm not used to seeing 00000 people at a game for my school. I wish school didn't involve class. I love the college atmosphere but not the class part. Maybe my psychology professor will give me an A. That would be great of him. He's a cool guy though I like his class. All my other professors are boring but he knows how to have fun while he lectures. I'm glad I got out of my calculus class and in a different one because professor radin is not cool at all. he needs to learn how to be not so uptight. My new calculus professor is cool though he's more laid back and knows how to teach things and give examples. Gosh I'm hungry I wish dinner were ready already. ORGNAME ORGNAME is really good late at night I just realized that. I'm glad it's open 00 hrs because where would I go eat at 0 a. M?  Speaking of ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME was fun I just wish we went to ORGNAME and danced a little. LOCNAME LOCNAME was cool but not as cool as burnet I want to hurry up and go hunting again. maybe this weekend I'll go back and shoot some more birds. Girls make me so mad. Why does a certain somebody have to be stupid all the time?  She bitches too much at me for little things. I should just not talk to her anymore. I don't know why I can't just not talk to her. All girls are the same to me, they all bitch about stupid things and get mad at you for saying hi to other girls that are your friends but they go off and say hi to their guy friends and expect us not to get mad at them. It's dumb. PROPNAME is dumb too. She should have ditched her boyfriend to hang out with her quote best friend PROPNAME on her birthday. She is stupid for choosing someone she just barely met over her best friend. PROPNAME doesn't deserve to cry I should yell at PROPNAME for that. PROPNAME is a cool girl she cares about me and doesn't want anything to happen to me I should hang out with her more. Stony Point football will always suck. They lose too much. New coaches are cool though I wish he was there when I was there. I need to do chemistry homework. He needs to stop mumbling and getting off topic to. My TA pisses me off so much I think I'm smarter than her. All the answers I had were right and the ones she gave me were wrong I can't believe that. 00 on the first hw is crap. there goes my confidence. She's a good looking girl though I'll give her that much but she can't help for crap. hopefully by this weekend I'll have my work done so I can hunt. I really can't stop thinking about hunting. I want to shoot me a deer I've never shot one before. Season opens soon I think so dove will have to do for now.

__label__label0 well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about. I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down. it probably will. like, I knew this would happen. I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it. my back itches. I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach. I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it. I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying "no", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was. my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class. I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately. I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time. my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me. when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything. now she is always getting mad at me for everything. she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says "where the fuck are you going". I never get mad at her for things she does to me though. I have infinite almost patience with her. she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 0 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says "fuck PROPNAME, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit". I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much. we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to. I have economics to do. 
__label__label1 Wow, hell week at the chi phi really put me back. I have homework out the ass. Damn I type really slow. I wish I could type faster. This song I'm listening to wasn't so bad. The next song I don't recognize, oh yea I do , hell yaw this song is great. time sure does go by. Wow this song really fits me maybe I should just roll with it. no more stalling just go and roll with it. May I should just do it. Fine the next time I see PROPNAME I just let her know how I feel. This writing assignment is really making me hate all of those people who type fast. Maybe I should have taken a typing class in high school. Damn this song brings back way to many memories. It always make me stop and think about the girl that I like at that time. Now I'm thinking about PROPNAME, she is just so nice. It just kind of grew and since we started out as friends it's hard to just transition into a relationship. Hopefully the feelings are not all one sided. Well I have plenty of time I see her almost every day. But if I wait too long she will become a permanent friend and I would have lost my chance. She is also my Spanish tutor so then my Spanish will be tied to my relationship. She has so much patience for me though. She can be my sugar momma. Damn I really can't stop thinking about here. I wonder why here phone wasn't working today, I kind of glad though. I need more time to think things out and its not always to do things in the spur of the moment. The tickets I got for the game suck. I can actually spit on the rice fans from my spot. Oh well, I got an extra ticket for PROPNAME, I'm actually glad I could only get one extra ticket. Now here friend can't come with us. I'm felling really anti-social lately. I'm not really hyper or energetic either. And have been sick with a soar throat and stuffy nose. I just want a few days to catch up. This assignment is almost over . I bet almost everyone else has more written then me. Oh well. Hey now. I have too many posters It looks like a kids room in here. I just wish I could concerto 
__label__label1 Oh damn!  Wednesday was awesome! please give me some water. My  friends are funny and so is this movie the brain is really cool with all its disorders  and shit for the love my friends are so sarcastic but I love it and I do it too damn I  need to stop smoking I'm like a chimney they joke about killing themselves which  is really funny because  i0 no they're joking I'm normally a good writer damn sorry. the  critic is awesome and my professor is so fucking funny I lived in midland too for  awhile cool I'm a psychology major I need gum can I have some.

I don't mind  bush or PROPNAME. they're both right. but I don't see why shit I forgot oh people in LOCNAME  are so liberal to the point of offense. maybe I'm blind (not literally) sigh puke? no  pee oh. I love the graduate and PROPNAME PROPNAME is my favorite movie ever but I  actually saw it when it first came out I like I like I like I like maybe its a hotel sorry  took a brake oh I think I can actually relate a lot to the movie because my family is  just like that children with problems with drugs (psychiatric or other) in a wealthy  family with the money craved superficial mom and many marriages on either side  and divorce with children all over the place and step dad lawyer asshole. did good  in school mental problems family support of prescription drugs grandmother and  
__label__label1 So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it fPROPNAME over like 0 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 0 minutes. However, I've noticed that PROPNAME's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 0 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see PROPNAME again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to ORGNAME in the spring. Or actually, I hope PROPNAME can come to LOCNAME for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the PROPNAME family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like PROPNAME. And even PROPNAME and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for PROPNAME and the whole family. God, PROPNAME and PROPNAME really do care about me and PROPNAME like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about PROPNAME cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like "do you want a drink?" Wow, I was like thinking "what is this?" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole "Louvre" idea. I always say I hate LOCNAME and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to LOCNAME in the summer. But I mean if PROPNAME wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, PROPNAME has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to PROPNAME. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to PROPNAME or PROPNAME talking to them. No, but PROPNAME's really cool. But so is PROPNAME's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and PROPNAME need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. PROPNAME is one of PROPNAME's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe
