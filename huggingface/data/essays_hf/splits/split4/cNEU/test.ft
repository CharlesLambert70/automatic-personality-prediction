__label__label0 Well I'm finally getting around doing the writing assignment, I'm feeling  relieved. I thought that for some reason I would not have the time to do  it, actually not get around to doing this assignment. I don't know the  reason behind that worry. hmmm. what do I write?  well I'm getting  tired already and I'm thinking will I be able to stay awake for thirty  minutes to type all this??? I hope so. well I'm thinking about my classes  and panic is setting in. I'm worried. I'm falling behind with reading  material in my courses and not . my mind has moved to something else. THE ORGNAME. I realized that I had to take it this spring so I’m getting  really nervous about it. I'm getting nervous now thinking about it. well  my eyes feel really tired. I want to sleep. I still feel nervous and anxiety towards this semester/the mcat/medical  schools/exams. I usually don't feel this nervous but since this year  counts so much with medical schools I feel that top performance is . what's a good word?  ummm. My mind is drawing a blank. essential?   well good enough. I feel I must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well I don't really agree with that statement. I just feel I need to  do good. I need to be satisfied. Hopefully get a 0. 0 this semester. what else?  I'm thinking what else I should write about? It's quiet in here. the fan is turned on. BUT its a LOCNAME. or bay  something. let me  see if I remember?? NOPE I sure don't. Well I didn't exercise today,  which explain why I'm soo tired. I love running it gives me so much energy and makes me feel great. I love working out, but nowadays I don’t have much  time b/c I live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time  that I just run at home sometimes, if I find a running buddy. the  nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, I like that  word its sounds so cute  when English people say it with their English accents. I'm worried. again. actually I'm thinking about my teacher recommendations  which is getting me worried. so I'm worrying myself now. too much of this  is not too good. I knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, I'm  wondering if it was psychological?  well,, probably there was some  psychological reason. woow,, I'm so happy I'm taking this course. its soo cool. I'm really tired. and bored now. yet I feel indifferent. as I was saying I think psychology is soo interesting. it seems really cool. The lectures are awesome. I'm happy. until the  first round of tests. curiosity and anxiety well not really I'm kind of curious . I'm thinking about my friend. old roomie. she’s in the corps at a&m and I'm  worried about her. I wish she would quit because they are so ridiculous. their little rules are ridiculous. when people have to pee in their sinks  because its easier to do than go to the bathroom that's when you have to  worry. I'm still worried. she's a good person. but that the path she  chose for herself. I’m hoping this will make me feel better. its working  I feel better now. but I'm still worried not so much upset,,, I wonder  how long I've been typ0ing?  I hope long enough let me take a peek at my  watch. YUP!!! yes! its been 00 minutes I'm not sure if I did this right. I sure hope so. I'm getting sleep and I still have a ton of work to do. I think I'll sleep my brain needs to replenish the exhausted brain cells. well I guess I'll end this now and go to bed. One thing I noticed is that  I was kinda indifferent not too emotional all through this because of my  fatigue. well . good night. and sweet dreams. and as my old roommate  would say. " don't let the bed bugs bite". I hope she pulls through. 
__label__label0 this is by far one of the most interesting assignments I have ever had to do  not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time I have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. I am very hungry right now and I could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. I am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, I guess they need this many to accommodate 00. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. I am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons ORGNAME has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. I am actually thinking of being a psy major. I think I may double major with a BA in music and another liberal arts degree . I sure am glad I switched out of my performance major. I just didn’t want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path I was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 00 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because I bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. I wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. I don’t want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least I know what to expect. I am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. I think the radio show went well last night  I hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we don’t look so incompetent. I don't think I spelled that right. just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten. probably why they don’t hire people right out of fourth grade. my roommate’s hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple. I told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity. that word is soooo overused and really annoying. sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card. we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing. this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 00 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this, I apologize for the sloppy spelling, bad grammar and weak syntax. I guess that's what being a TA is all about, huh? 
__label__label1 Right now I am thinking about my girlfriend and what she is doing. Why is this guy behind me being so loud in the study center. I almost forgot how to spell "center. "  This guy is trying to be as loud as possible. What is going on tonight?  I sure do have a lot of homework. Why doesn't this guy get a megaphone so he can be even louder?  Shut up Please!  I hate this kid. Why is this girl laying on the couch doing her homework?  I had fun last night. I wonder what my roommate did. This guy is really pissing me off. What the hell is his problem?  I swear to everything that is holy if he does not shut up I will make the next four years of his life a living nightmare. What is my friend PROPNAME doing right now?  This is boring. Not hard though. This seems so stupid of a time. It's only been five minutes I still have fifteen more to go. What classes do I have tomorrow?  SHUTUP ASSHOLE!!!  I have Calculus and English. One hour classes not too bad. I am tired. I am going to take a nap later. I am getting tired of writing. Getting sleepy. What is this guy next to me doing?  This guy that walked in is a real dork. I wonder what he did last night. Only ten minutes to go. This jerk is moaning out loud now. What is he thinking?  I am going to kill him. This guy's headphones are way too loud. I am hungry. Why?  I just ate. I am getting tired of waiting. This is boring. Only eight more minutes that I have to listen to this inconsiderate bastard. That guy wants that girl. I am through now. I am going to my room to sleep. 
__label__label1 Okay here it goes. I am freezing in this computer lab doing this project that no one will ever read but, hey, I don't want to be negative. Let's start with something else. I want to start over already. I do that every time. Just like when I am about to serve a volleyball, I always get stuck for some reason and have to start over. it is like I don't trust what I am about to do. All I can really think of right now is how the professor, I don't even know his name, was talking about thinking about my Dog. Oh yea, PROPNAME. I am not really thinking anything at all now. this really makes this assignment difficult. I know that I’m not spelling any of these words right. My hands are so tired, I’m sure why. This reminds me of when I was a little girl, and I would lay in bed at night and try to see if I could think nothing. But I would always seem to be thinking two thoughts at a time. I would be thinking I'm thinking nothing, I'm thinking nothing" and at the same time, I would be singing a song in my head or something. I don't see how this project can work really. It seems like I have so many thoughts per second, that by the time I write down one thought, so many are missed that you don't get and accurate stream of consciousness. Some bell just went off. I thought it might a fire alarm but it's not. I don't think it would matter if it was, no one seemed to care. I always think about thoughts people have while they are one stage. And dreams. my friend PROPNAME, her mom owns this weird new age shop where they have a lot of drean stuff. There is this woman that will tell you your future. Just like when I was working in LOCNAME LOCNAME, PROPNAME, my boss, went to a psychic and I always think about this woman who's eyes are green like she is possessed or something. I thought john was really dumb to go to those things. He also did cocaine, man he was really messed up. I wish I would not have stayed at that job as long as I did. I wonder why there are some people like PROPNAME, then there are some people that have a head on their shoulders. I guess I'm going to being learning about that in psychology. I hope my little brother makes it into this school next year,  Mom and Dad say that his grades aren’t good enough. That sort of breaks  my heart. I wonder how in the world I can really write down my thoughts when half the time, I don't even know what I’m thinking. It seems like the thoughts overlap some times. I can't wait till the results of the audition go up today. This assignment is funny, I bet a bunch of people come in here and write on this thing like it's a diary or something then someone out there reads it and tired man I'm tired 0 o’clock this morning I am just pushing buttons helping some guy out there make an experiment I am not even looking at the screen haven't been this whole time really I like pressing the space bar this makes me so self conscience because I am having the stupidest thoughts my eyelids are closing I don't want to go to lunch with that girl today she is so young my head id getting heavy this is funny like a dramatic comedy I guess I think in theatre terms a lot, huh I also think about my dad right now when I was growing up I can't remember when I started this thing but I think in a few minutes I will be done red headband cold on my arms nothing to do until noon sound of the computer next to me typing of the keys  this chair hurts my back every time I push it up it falls down I brought an extra pad today oh, if that guy reads this I hope he don't get grossed out by that part. I love finding out about god. that sky was so beautiful sun big whole when I get sleepy, no one can understand me. big guy to my left sound again cut thoughts I just erased something I wrote down I ruined the experiment sounds off flipping pages that's it twenty 
__label__label0 I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an "A" we should try to learn something for a change in LOCNAME instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 0:00? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 00 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad. She probably wouldn't want me though because I'm black. Who gives a fuck. In the goat ass. Colin's here he's hungry. BEEr dance naked bitches oops I can't stand ugly women unless they are with good-looking ones. Kiss me PROPNAME. What if your nipples were on your forehead? Piss on me I'm a dickfor.

__label__label1 I’m in my apartment with my new desk, everything is finally getting organized. I feel like this year will be a good one, I am not the same person that I used to be. I feel so much more secure. sure there were times when I would see people gathered in a huge group and think to myself that I wanted to join and be a part of it but when it comes right down to it, I am the kind of person who likes to have a couple of really close friends and then a lot of friends who I can say hi to and visit with on occasion. I really believe that that is okay. my boyfriend and I are great, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't need to be with him all the time so we enjoy each other's company a lot when we are together because it is not so often. he sees me in a totally different light this year and I feel the same way about him. I wonder if PROPNAME is having a good time tonight with Ira. I think that she is trying to convince herself that she doesn't want any relationships with guys. I wonder if it bothers her that PROPNAME is here. I hope not but I am not going to ban my boyfriend from coming to the apartment just because she doesn't have someone to come see her. I hope that isn't horrible. PROPNAME is going really well. it's going to be a really busy year I can already tell but I think that I can definitely handle it this year, I have the right mind set. the meeting last night was way to long though. who wants to sit in a chair for three hours discussing what seems like today as absolutely nothing!!! it was crazy. so many times I wanted to jump out of my chair and leave the room but I sat there and listened to all of the nonsense. this sorority thing is driving me crazy. on the one hand, it has the potential to be a lot of fun, on the other hand it is a huge time commitment and I am not sure if I want to put myself into something that leaves little time for anything else, on the other hand the old PROPNAME wouldn't get involved at all because she would be too nervous. I don't want to be that PROPNAME anymore. I never realized how hard it would be to write for twenty minutes. I feel like I have said a lot and it has only been ten minutes maybe. my boyfriend is in the other room studying, ha he has to go next. my classes are good this semester. history is going to be boring not because I hate the subject but because I am more interested in a discussion class and 0000 to the Civil War is so long ago and I feel like I studied it to satisfaction in high school. last year at LOCNAME I remember thinking it would be fun to study history again and I was irritated that as a freshman I couldn't take the class, look how times change. I think I am more organized this year than ever before in my life. my walls need paintings though or at least posters, I wonder where I can get cheap ones. I want to buy those glow in the dark stars and planets for my walls too. I think those are great. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. I hope he does better at school this year than he did last year. I am sure he will. he seems to have more control over himself this year. I can't believe he is taking drivers ed. how weird. I am so tired right now. I have so much reading to do. I am not going to sleep until it is all done, I must be prepared this year. I can stop thinking about some song where it says that the hardest to learn is the least complicated. it's hard to learn to study but once you do your life is so easy. I am going to learn that this year. that was an indigo girls song. what a fun concert. I wish they would come back to town. how great it was seeing PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I can't believe I didn't see PROPNAME there. I missed her this summer. she and PROPNAME will work well together I am sure. I am glad he is working at PROPNAME it will be nice spending time with him in that setting. 
__label__label0 It took me forever to get into this program I had the address written all down wrong and now I am going to be late for practice PROPNAME is waiting for me and she is not going to be happy I can't believe I have a flat tire everyone was honking at me to tell me on MLK. oh well so I had to walk here and now I am running completely behind schedule I am gonna get PROPNAME to fix my tire tonight when he gets off work I hope he knows how to change a flat and where to take it because I have no idea he won't mind he is really a cool guy what am I gonna do until then I guess I’ll just walk back home to it is good exercise for me any way now I am so sidetracked I don’t know what to write my parents are coming Friday so now I have to clean for them and that I have absolutely no time for but I guess I'll have to find it gosh my typing is terrible and I keep hitting the wrong letters since I haven't typed all summer. this computer thing is not for me I am so computer illiterate but I am very open to learning if someone would teach me I don't want to go to work on Friday I really don’t like it there anymore I probably should quit then I would have no money whatsoever that it'll be nice maybe I will starve and lose some weight I really didn't me that I could never starve myself I love food too much my gosh PROPNAME is going to be pretty mad since I was suppose to be at practice ten minutes ago to teach her what we learned now she is just going to be waiting on  me because I am gonna have to walk down there and it will take forever. my car hasn't had a flat in such a long time I wonder what I hit because I didn't see anything in the tire but what do I know. my mind is just going blank nothing can run through it cause I’m so tired. I want my shoes back from winstons house they have been there for a week now and they are my favorites but I can't remember exactly how to get there I would probably get lost I can't wait for this weekend the game will be so much fun and I won't be so nervous for it this time I wonder how many people will be there for ORGNAME how exciting I am so glad I talked to my friend PROPNAME last night he sounds like he is having so much fun in LOCNAME at occidental I can't wait to visit him he says his classes are pretty tough I would probably drop out! just picking it wouldn't hurt to get a good kick in the butt to get myself in gear. gosh twenty minutes seems like forever to put down all your thoughts I don't even remember what I have attempted to type so far I think my time is almost up though and then I can run to bellmont to help PROPNAME who has no clue where I am I was suppose to call my friend PROPNAME last night to see how rush went at her school and I didn't I am a little curious to see what she picked I cant believe she hasn't called to tell me because I am her best friend but I guess I can forgive and forget but hopefully she'll call me tonight last night I talked to rhiannon and she sounded so upset I hope things will get better for her I am so tired I am falling asleep good thing my time is just about up because I am exhausted naturally I cant go take a nap because I have practice I guess its all worth it in the end because I get to perform for a lot of people but sometimes it seems like a waist because no one bothers to tell the new girls what is going on and then we look like idiots I want so much to say something but so far I have kept my mouth shut and just had my own kind of fun I don’t know if they act this way on purpose or they just don't know exactly what they are doing I try my hardest and ever since I hurt my knee it has sucked tremendously I can't strut my usual stuff and I just want to scream because no one knows how much it hurts well it has been well over 00 minutes now so I am going to practice bye! 
__label__label0 I am sitting here at ORGNAME ORGNAME, boy I am so stressed out. I have these  two writing assignments for psychology a whole bunch of pre-cal homework  and tons of reading to do for Biology and Sociology. this sorority stuff  is starting to take up way to much time. I really don't like the feeling I  am getting when I am set up with a date because it makes me feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't feel bad since I am just being friends with them and nothing more it just really bothers me sometimes. I really don't feel like going out tonight because I still  think I am sick from yesterday. I need to go and call my mom and dad  since I haven't talked to them in about five days I am just way to busy. I think I really need to work on some major time management skills because I  am worried about getting behind and I want to get 0 As and 0 Bs so I can  start off good before my classes get too hard. I am really excited about  UT vs. OU weekend I hope that PROPNAME can go so that I don't have to go with some random guy. I wish it wasn't the same weekend as my schools homecoming so that I could go home oh well. I need to take a shower and get ready  for the KA mixer and try to read and definitely watch 00000. That was 00 Minutes. THANK YOU!  HAVE A NICE DAY! 
__label__label0 Well, here we go with the stream of consciousness essay. I used to do things like this in high school sometimes. They were pretty interesting, but I often find myself with a lack of things to say. I normally consider myself someone who gets straight to the point. I wonder if I should hit enter any time to send this back to the front. Maybe I'll fix it later. My friend is playing guitar in my room now. Sort of playing anyway. More like messing with it. He's still learning. There's a drawing on the wall next to me. Comic book characters I think, but I'm not sure who they are. It's been a while since I've kept up with comic's. I just heard a sound from ICQ. That's a chat program on the internet. I don't know too much about it so I can't really explain too well. Anyway, I hope I'm done with this by the time another friend comes over. It will be nice to talk to her again. She went home this weekend for Labor Day. So did my brother. I didn't go. I'm not sure why. No reason to go, I guess. Hmm. when did I start this. Wow, that was a long line. I guess I won't change it later. Okay, I'm running out of things to talk about. I've found that happens to me a lot in conversation. Not a very interesting person, I guess. Well, I don't know. It's something I'm working on. I'm in a class now that might help. The phone just rang. Should I get it?  The guy playing the guitar answered it for me. It's for my roommate. My suitemate just came in and started reading this. I'm uncomfortable with that. He's in the bathroom now. You know, this is a really boring piece of literature. I never realized how dull most everyday thoughts are. Then again, when you keep your mind constantly moving like this, there isn't really time to stop and think deeply about things. I wonder how long this is going to be. I think it's been about ten minutes now. Only my second line. How sad. Well, not really considering how long these lines are. Anyway, I wonder what I'm going to do the rest of the night. I guess there's always homework to do. I guess we'll see. This seat is uncomfortable. My back sort of hurts. I think I'm going to have arthritis when I get older. I always thought that I wouldn't like to grow old. Not too old, I suppose. I've always been a very active person. I have a fear of growing old, I think. I guess it'll go away as I age gradually. I don't know how well I'd deal with paralysis from an accident though. As long as I have God and my friends around, I'll be okay though. I'm pretty thirsty right now. There isn't much to drink around my room. Ultimate Frisbee, I haven't played that all summer. Fun game, but tiring. I'm out of shape. I'd like to get in better shape, but I hate running. It's too dull for me. Hmmm. it's almost over now. Just a few more minutes. Let's see if I make it to the next line. Short reachable goals!  Whatever. Anyway, what else do I have to do tonight. I guess I could read some. My shirt smells like dinner. It's pretty disgusting. I need to wake up for a 0:00 am class tomorrow. I remember when that wasn't early at all. Well, I made it to the next line. I'm so proud of myself. That's sarcasm, by the way. I wonder if I was suppose to right this thing as a narrative. Oh well too late now. Time for me to head out. Until next time, good bye and good luck. I don't know. 
__label__label1 To think about what life has become can be kind of scary. I wish I had a penny for every time I was about to mess up and I think I would be a very rich woman. If I only knew at 00 what I now know at almost 00, I could have saved myself alot of pain and confusion. Then couldn't we all have?  I get scared sometimes when I think about today, two weeks from now and even years from now. The future is a very scary thing especially when you don't know what it could bring. I wish I hadn't made some of the choices I've made but those are over and done with aren't they. The only thing I need to learn how to do now is to learn from my mistakes. I feel really bad sometimes because I try to force my ideas and ideologies on those younger than me but I feel older and wiser than my years. I feel alot older than 00 sometimes yet I think, " hey I'm only 00, I have so much life to live"  Yet I'm scared to live that life. I wish I could just go with the flow instead of worry about every choice I make all the time. Even when I go with the flow I don't know what I'm doing and then I worry about what could happen after the fact. Another thing that really bothers me is the whole concept of love. What is it and how do I know if I've found it or not. When I was 00 I knew alot more about love than I do now. Why do I ramble on so, it is the same dilemma and the same problems I face every single day. I really should just give up and go with the flow. not worry about things so much. Life's too short to worry right,. All I'm doing is stressing myself out over nothing. Stress is not something I should have in my life. My whole world is sheltered and taken care of and paid for. What do I really have to worry about. Not that my dad doesn't have stipulations on what I do but it is all basically taken care of with no questions asked. Life shouldn't be that easy right?  Maybe that's why I continue to torture myself with these unnecessary dilemmas. I'm one of those drama people to I need drama in my life, something always going on or I get bored. I need conflict but not too much because then I get way too stressed out. I just don't know what to do with daddy's little girl who seems really messed up in the head,  There I go again creating drama, I'm not really messed up but sometimes I try to convince my self that I am to try to get counseling or something. I think it's a hidden Freudian issue. I should have had counseling when I was a child but I never got it because I didn't really need it. Maybe I was really traumatized as a child and now it's coming out subliminally. Ok enough kelly, this is not like you. I really don't think all of this I just do sometimes. Who knows  I sure as hell don't. My dog is so cute now. too bad I don't live with him. I want to be taken care of pampered in a way, just plain babied. That's what should happen for women isn't it. No we should be strong and independent but I don't really feel that way. I would love to live a life similar to my mom's. She isn't as taken care of as I would like to be but my daddy does all right by her. Who knows what life will bring maybe I will quit thinking about it. oh. the clock on my computer says I've been typing for twenty minutes. Cool this is a really good stress reliever and I really felt like I was talking to someone. Cya 
__label__label1 Today is September 0, 0000. It is twelve days before my best friend leaves for the ORGNAME. He has come to LOCNAME to visit. I have dreaded these past couple of months ever since I knew he was leaving. He has been my best friend for five years. We have gone through so much stuff during those years. It is hard for me to say good-bye, but I know I must. We said we would see each other in six years but how will we know. it bothers me to know that he will forget about me, but I hope and pray he won't. Ever since he has come to visit we have went out and done something. Usually we just talk. He has been the only person that has understood what I feel. It's like we have some unknown connection that I can't really explain. But I realize that time will go one and maybe in six years we will find each other and things will be  the same as they were be for either of us left. but how will I be certain. I told him that this is the hardest thing for me to do. I don't know if he understands it or not, who knows. It's kind of funny. Everyone believes that best friends (when male and female) make the best couples. And everyone always told us that we will probably get married, I don't think so. There isn't that feeling of that kind of love there. When I came too UT and began to meet other people, I didn't feel that I was loosing him, merely that I didn't think about him so much. But there were times that I missed his companionship when I didn't have someone to talk to. That is what I’m going to really miss the most about him. He has the great capability to listen and help out, even though he is male. But I will always love him and his great personality even if he changes during the years. I believe we have come to far in life as friends to let our friendship fail. September 00, will be a very sad and happy day because he will begin his career and future and I will be missing my best friend in the world. 
__label__label1 I finally got all of my Ethernet problems worked out today, so I e-mailed  everyone I know. I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 00 disk but I also received my PROPNAME  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm glad  I got a card from PROPNAME today, looks like she's having a good time at ORGNAME. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in LOCNAME, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in LOCNAME and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the ORGNAME game November, PROPNAME doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise I’d write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see PROPNAME then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that I’m getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap. I wish I had some nail polish remover, I need to repaint my toenails. I wonder if I can make it through three weeks before I need to get my nails redone. I hope so I don’t want to change manicurists, I like PROPNAME. 
__label__label0 Why am I doing this assignment?  I do not want to be here? I think I want to go to sleep. I wish PROPNAME would shut up so I could do my homework. When I play basketball I wish PROPNAME would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish PROPNAME would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in LOCNAME. PROPNAME needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish PROPNAME would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. PROPNAME needs to shut up. PROPNAME is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. PROPNAME better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily PROPNAME left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket. I need to find that guys number but I lost it so I guess I will never find it. I hate HOT I think they are gay . So I do not know why PROPNAME is listening to it. I wish I could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. Why doesn’t he listen to some other music that sounds better. I wish I could go back home and drive my car. I miss driving my car. I got a ORGNAME Civic. It is silver and it is all mine. I am thinking about bringing it up next semester. I wish they would turn this music off but then again why do I care. I wish they would play some Tupac or Snoop. I have two more minutes. I wish the two minute would go by faster. I need to get some carpet for my room . I'm thinking about switching my major. I might go to business or I might just stick Psychology and try to go into physical therapy after I finish college. I have one more minute left and then I am done. Toad is stupid. I hate Puff Daddy this song is sop overplayed. 
__label__label0 I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 0 to 00 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 00 concert. I love PROPNAME so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. PROPNAME, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 0. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to LOCNAME to see everybody there and especially PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Mrs. PROPNAME, and of course PROPNAME. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. PROPNAME needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 0 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the ORGNAME win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up. 
__label__label1 My love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as I sit here and write this assignment. I don't understand any sLOCNAMEtware but everything for ORGNAME, and the Macintosh is completely foreign to me. I must have already asked at least 00 questions regarding the system, but hey I am new to this whole ORGNAME thing. Apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to ORGNAME and the computer world will be a lot happier. Every time I type the word a lot, I am reminded of my English teacher in 00th grade, or maybe it was 0th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. I'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that I should have written it as two. I think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. I see a lot of people around campus just like that although I remember their faces and words, for the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, Azi, do you remember me?? More than likely I would not, or I would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. I do that a lot. People will have said that they may have called my name 0 or 0 times before I responded by just looking up. My thoughts consume me sometimes. I have a problem with daydreaming. I know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. It is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. I was talking about my thoughts, and how I daydream. Well, lately all I can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man I am to marry. It seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a Freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. I have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. I went to a summer church retreat, and I think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because I met guys for the first time that I could honestly see myself marrying. This has never happened before, and as I glance around the campus, I just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and I am here longing for there company. It is not like I need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. I miss them a whole lot because I have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that I met at this church retreat in LOCNAME. I think I forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout LOCNAME, and I have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless I actively seek a job to where I can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful LOCNAME LOCNAME of LOCNAME. All of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and I miss them terribly. I have to go back some day, I haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as I had in LOCNAME. I know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little  bit of why I would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason I would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a Baptist church, or a Jewish synagogue embodies. That spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. It would be ideal if I could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. Get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and I stress this because that is a big part of my life, but I am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. It's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, I am not asking for the PROPNAME and ORGNAME playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, I just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. I just don't think that I can have that right now, and that is why I spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. The challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. And if I may I would like to end with a statement that PROPNAME PROPNAME made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm not really sure what types of things I'm supposed to be saying. I miss my boyfriend so much. I hope he has a safe trip home. I hope he doesn't fall asleep. I feel really sleepy myself. I hope I can stay awake for this twenty minutes. Time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. Especially when school work is involved. I wish I was a better typer. It is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. People probably think I'm not a very interesting person. I try to be, but I think I was born to be boring. Be boring and study my life away. I really don't mean to be so studious. I mean I want to do well in school, but I think I'm too caught up in it. Everything makes me nervous. It is so strange because even though I know this isn't going to be "graded", I feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. I miss my family and my friends. I don't think I appreciated them enough when I was home. It is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. It took years to be so close to them, and now I have to start all over. I'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. I wonder if they miss me as much as I miss them. I'm so paranoid. I'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. What if they don't mean "love" in the same way that I do?  I hate being hurt. I like to be in control and be omniscient. I like to have the upper hand with people. Unfortunately,  I think most of the time I'm the vulnerable one. Is that normal?  Probably. If I tell myself that enough I might believe it. Could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. So many songs make that claim. It must be a truly amazing love. I am still in awe when I think about what PROPNAME did for me and everyone else. He died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. What love!  How sad though to think that not everyone accepts it!  I feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. I feel like there is something I could say to solve it, but I just don't know what. I know I'm not doing everything I could for Christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. I know I can't be perfect, but I try so hard to be. It feels that I come up short a lot in my life. It is so stressful. I'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. I can't stop though. Kale is so wonderful. He would do anything for me. I can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. My parents have to, but he doesn't. It is amazing. 
__label__label0 Every time I get one of these writing assignments my mind always seems to go blank. They tell me "write about what is in your mind". It shouldn't be that hard I mean I am always thinking of something. For example right now I'm thinking I shouldn't have missed breakfast. Anyway this is sort of like writing a letter to a friend where you don't have to worry about grammar and things like that. At least I hope not. I feel like the twenty minutes are never going to be over. Actually I am amazed at how fast I am typing, and I've never taking typing course in my life. Well I think I'm typing fast. I don't know how many words a minute I can type. I hope I do well in school. This place is huge. I am enjoying myself. I've never been on my own before. You can call it a learning experience. There is not much to here with out a car. I hope I get credit for this. I wonder if this one of those things were they try to get into the mind of LOCNAME's youth. They probably didn't get much out of me, since I don't seem to be thinking anything interesting. Maybe I don't know to type all that well. Some people just sit down and all you here are them hitting the keys. I wish I was like that, I could finish my assignments quicker. I need to take a typing course. I also need toenail clippers. You guys probably don't want to here that, but you asked to write down what I was thinking. I also need a poncho because it looks like it's going to rain. No chance in you guys getting me one? Well the twenty minutes are up. c-ya     
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems like a long time. It amazes me how weird time is. Like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. I spend alot of time on planes. My dad is a pilot. I fly free. I don't know what I will do after college, because then I don't fly free anymore. I won't be able to go anywhere whenever. My roommate is in the shower. She has a sorority thing tonight. I'm not in a sorority. I'm glad, it's not the place for me. A guy died in my hometown last weekend. I t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and PROPNAME PROPNAME and Princess PROPNAME had just died. I didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. I think about that a lot. Death. Like what if someone died that I knew, but I had never told them what they mean to me. That's selfish, I know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. We as in humans. A friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. I like country music, but most people don't. I just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. My back hurts. I like to rub people's backs. I wish someone was here to rub mine. Tonight I'll be alone in the dorm. I like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. My roommate and I knew each other in high school. We have gotten along amazingly well so far. Knock on wood. I have never been in a car accident, when I was driving. My brother messed up his knee in a car accident. I like this song. He had to have his ACL ligament redone. He can be such a baby. I think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. I really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. That's just a personal opinion. I give lots of personal opinions. People tell me I'm opinionated. I don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. It's important to be able to communicate. I'm a speech major. My undergrad advisor is great. I met him at orientation, and I love him. He tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. I don't like this song. It's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. I wonder if I'll get married. I think I want to, but not kids. I do not want kids. That's another one of my opinions. How can we bring a child into this world?  So then people ask me if  I wish I hadn't been born. Two completely different concepts. Anyway, I'm gonna call my Aunt PROPNAME. She is like a second mother to me. I live my mother. She really is my lifeline. That's a scary thought, like could I survive without her?  Of course, she raised my to be a survivor. I love basketball. My mom and I watch games together all the time. The ORGNAME are my favorite team. I also like PROPNAME PROPNAME. But I hat e the bulls. PROPNAME always says what he is thinking. Some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but I love it. H breaks the mold. That's commendable in my book. I miss my cousins. One of them is a big basketball fan. He and I always talk basketball. I'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as I thought it would. I really like this song. I'm finished!! 
__label__label0 Well, I finally made it to the computer lab. Of course I waited until the last minute. Now that I figured out how to get in here it won't be so hard tomorrow. I hope I can get it done tomorrow by 0 because I only have an hour between classes. I am so happy that I got out of my class early today. It gives me time to study other things. I think I did fairly well on my quiz but who knows. I should have gone to work today. I feel a little guilty for leaving when I did, but I show up and they aren't even there. What am I supposed to do, just stand out in the hall like an idiot?  This job is a waste of my time. They never have anything for me to do anyway. I wish I could quit, but I can't because Mom is friends with PROPNAME and I need the money. Especially now because of the car situation. I swear PROPNAME is just being a big baby about the whole thing. I hope I'm not in a bad mood this weekend. It will be nice to just relax without having to go out. I hope my dinner turns out ok. PROPNAME might be sorry he asked me to cook for him. I need to call him tonight for his birthday. I hope the package he got was either from his mom or dad. I can't believe he didn't get a card from either of them last year. I know he was upset about that, but of course he would never admit that to me. It's too bad sometimes that I can't talk to him about everything. Like last night, I know he didn't know what to say when I called, but I just kept thinking that if I had been talking to LOCNAME or PROPNAME they would know how to handle the situation better. But what can I expect, he's just a guy. He's told me before that he doesn't handle the mushy stuff very well. At least he listens to me. I'm glad I had the chance to talk to PROPNAME yesterday. I really do feel bad about not visiting her, but I knew it was best for everyone if we didn't see her. At least she doesn't live here anymore. I think that would be a bad situation. I really hope she gets over him soon. She's been sad too long, and it's just not doing her any good. I've completely run out of things to say, and that doesn't happen to me very often. Unfortunately it's happening more often. I really love it here at LOCNAME, but it is incredibly lonely. I see thousands of people everyday, but I'm still lonely. I guess that's why I'm on the phone for so long every night. I need to feel connected to my friends even if I don't see them as much as I used to. Unfortunately, I'm on the phone so much that I don't get much studying done. It's alot different than High school. I never had to study in high school. Now I'm so behind, and I don't know if I'll ever get caught up. I guess when I'm done with this I'll go study until my next class, which happens to be psychology. I thought this was supposed to be a lesson in stress relief. Well, this assignment has given me nothing but a headache. Speaking of headaches I can't seem to get rid of mine. It's either stress or allergies. Either way I'm suffering. Well, I'm finally done so I guess this is it. 
__label__label1 I am reading a book called Atlas Shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel I've ever read. Ayn PROPNAME wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of Objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that I feel are very important to all humans. I find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. Not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. The anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. Why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a "fair" chance. It really is disgusting. Just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. THIS IS STUPID. If those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they?  I also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. These are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. Personally I would hate knowing that I found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. I would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where I was. But not many people think like this anymore. I guess that I just have way too much faith in my abilities, but I'm glad I do. Ayn Rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. So in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called PROPNAME PROPNAME decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. He decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, Atlas Shrugged. So one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. It is such a great argument too. You should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. This is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. The men who build the world in this book form a secret Utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. Thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. Anyway, I have this friend called PROPNAME and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. Actually he's not my friend anymore because I don't want such an asshole for a friend. He's the only person I've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. You hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as I am. He thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. The only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. I have heard say horrible things about all of his "friends" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. I've overheard him saying that he's set  in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 000000. This wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. Of course, this is probably the root of his problem. I've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. If he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. He doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. And, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. He really has sever problems. I guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what I mean, the biggest asshole ever. Anyway, uhmmmmmm, I went back home this weekend to get my car and I got to see my dog. I missed her more than I missed my parents. She’s so pretty. She's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, Just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. Pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. She had her tail between her legs all night long. My roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. He's listens to a different kind of music than I do, but that's cool, because I'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 00 minutes are up so bye bye. 
__label__label0 0/0/00 Yeah, I've finally gotten around to doing this assignment. I hope I do o. k. Oh whoops, I forgot to check my watch to see when I need to stop. O. k. it's 0:00 so I will stop at 0:00. I just double spaced at the end of that period. I remember learning how to do that in my 0th grade computer class. Oh gosh, what if this is too short?  I'm a really slow typer, but this is really fun. The girl next to me is typing so fast, maybe I will be that good by the end of this year. There is a boy now walking around with a blank expression on his face. I wonder where he is going. After this I am going to my room and working on some homework. I like how the keys on this computer feel when I type. I miss my computer at my house, but anyway. This is fun, because I'm so used to typing in an organized fashion where everything is structured. I mean this assignment is structured, but our writing doesn't have to be. My left eye itches, but I'm afraid you touch it because I don't want to waste any time on my assignment. My watch just beeped which means that it is now 0:00, and I have ten minutes left. Wow, a loud buzzer just went off, maybe someone messed up a computer or something. Someone just rattled his change which reminds me that I have only a little bit of money left for the week. I hope I'm writing enough. This is as fast as I can go. I wonder if you really read these or just skim through them. It said this was a completion grade, good. I'll work on the other assignment tomorrow afternoon. the line now for waiting has gotten really long. Thank goodness it is air-conditioned in here. My left eye still hurts and is making me blink. I wonder what the others in here are working on?  I wonder what my parents are doing right now?  They are probably both already at home. I hope they find a place to stay for parents weekend. Gosh, that sounds so freshman. I only have 0 more minutes left. There is no way the teacher reads all of these. The t. a. must help. I like PROPNAME. I went to one of his study sessions. My nails are long and I wanted to get a manicure. I wonder how many in the class have finished this assignment?  Typing is very therapeutic, I feel a lot more relaxed now. I hope I've typed enough. The girl next to me is leaving. I have 0 minutes left. I just checked my watch. I'm kind of sleepy. I think I will go to bed early tonight. Yeah, tonight PROPNAME PROPNAME is on. He's my favorite. Oh, my time is up. I'll be back tomorrow to work on the next homework!!! 
__label__label1 I'm in the computer lab upstairs. I don't know what to write. there are a lot of people here. the computer next to me is broken but I don't know how. the guy who was sitting there earlier was kinda cute in a nerdy sort of way. some guy just walked behind me. there was a loud noise just now. don’t know what it was though. kinda scared me cause I thought I did something wrong and the people who control the computers would come after me and make me pay a million dollars for the entire system. wow the girl next to me got a long email. I got a few emails today. why do people wear socks with sandals?  don't they know it doesn't look good?  the computer screen is huge. I bet you a million dollars that this is the stupidest writing assignment you will get back from a student. I don't really measure up to the rest of the class. wow the girl next to me is typing really slowly. I'm in the I section. how come on some computers I and l look the same and they also look like 0. ewwwwww that girl should NOT be wearing something so tight. I've been at this computer for a long time. how come there are so many blonde people here. I wouldn't want to have yellow hair. I want headphones so I can listen to music. I'll bring them next time. I'd do this from my room, but I don't have my Ethernet set up because the computer store doesn't have any software there. recycling is weird. why don't they make it a law that you have to recycle. and if you don't recycle, you get fined like a million dollars. why do people read when they should log onto their computer?  I mean, there are TONS of people waiting to use computers and then you have people like this who read instead of type. why do people sit at booths in the cafeteria alone?  don't they have common sense?  a booth is not for one person. it's for more than one person. that's why there are tables everywhere. so you can eat at tables alone in the corner instead of taking up a whole booth alone. there should be a law against that. I’d enforce it. Emily's boyfriend's name is PROPNAME. that's my boyfriend's name. only her boyfriend is close by. mine is far. it's sad. she's going to go out with me and her boyfriend this weekend. she's gonna have sex with him. I want to have sex. but PROPNAME’s so far away right now. I have a chem test on Wednesday. I’m scared. I think I’m gonna fail it. I have to study. tonight is Melrose place though so I can't study at 0. I’ll study after that. I wanna party. I drank too much coke today. i want water. I’m hungry. man it's cold here. how come my room is so cold?  I want to change the temp but then it might be too hot. every place is freezing here and it's hot as hell outside. is hell a bad word?  why do people think it's bad?  and why is God Damn so bad?  you can say ass on TV but not god damn?  and who decided it was bad anyway?  I wrote a high school essay about it one time but I have no idea. why are bad words bad words?  who decided they were bad. I want glasses. I think it makes you look smarter if you get a good pair that is. the computer next to me is broken. that noise was loud again. same noise as before. green is a cool color. forest green though. not the crappy lime greens and other green colors. forest green. aha!  I’m right under the vent. that's why I’m freezing. I can't wait for Melrose place tonight. I’ve been waiting all summer for it. do you think PROPNAME's gonna leave?  she can't. she's my favorite. I’m glad PROPNAME left. PROPNAME’s a whiner. glad they killed PROPNAME off. ever watch 00000?  it's stupid. why do they have Braille on the number things that say what station you're on?  How would a blind person use a computer?  I want email. I get a ton of it but I want more. I want real letters though. I want to go down to the mail place and be able to say "WOAH I GOT MAIL". :( This paper was a cool one to write. I wanna do it again but I'll have to wait until tomorrow. I skipped class today. don't know why. I was lazy. I need to shape up or ship out. I never liked that phrase. who wants to ship out?  how can you ship out?  we're all on land. not at sea. PROPNAME’s joining the navy. I wish he wouldn't go. I want him to move here. why do people wear fanny packs?  they're not flattering. too many sorority chicks here. we have 0 kappa deltas on our floor. valley girls. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't. do they make the whole school do it?  I love the smell of freshly done laundry. I did my laundry already but I want to do it again so it'll be all warm and smell good. I want to go to a party. I want to get drunk like on my vacation. not that drunk though. just drunk enough to have fun. wow that guy's cute. he looked at me. woo hoo. there are a lot of old people here. old old old. I wanna be older but I don't wanna get OLD. just hit submit and you'll get it huh?  that's cool. I still have to find my way here one more time to write it again. wow so much fun. there are too mane people here waiting for computers. I should go downstairs next time. warning!  when you log out all your files will be erased. duh. save em loser. psychology. how come every frat boy and sorority chick majors in psych?  how many psychologists can the world have?  did you know ORGNAME is the slacker school of the nation. I read that somewhere. isn't that cool?  this place is huge. wow he's a hippie. what am I?  normal. abnormal. quiet. loud. who knows?  I’m me I guess. I’d like to know what other people think about me though. might be interesting. time's up. I gotta go check my mail. 
__label__label1 I just got done watching "First Time Felon" staring PROPNAME PROPNAME. I was very moving. I'm cooking stew right now on the stove. I learned how to cook it from my father. He taught me how this summer. Earlier today, I did this writing assignment and after completing it, I pressed clear instead of submit. That sure got me upset. Anyway, I went to class today and the lecture was funny. The phone is ringing right now. The phone is still ringing. There, someone finally picked up the phone. I have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. And in two weeks I'll start having my first set of tests. They all fall on me at once. When I think about it, I don't want to study. But thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. I kind of enjoy it. It was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. I remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. That was a really nice view. I wonder how the stew is doing. Hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. I see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. I really miss him. He was like a brother to me. We always looked out for each other. I'm really good friends with his brother too. He is a good church-going person. Faithfully believes in God. Well, I haven't talked to either of them for some time now. Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow if I have time. My girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. It was just a message. I really miss her. She is back in LOCNAME. Her birthday is coming up on the 00th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. The problem is that I have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. I wish I could take the tests some other time. Oh, well. That's life for you. My brother landed an internship with ORGNAME, but hasn't started work yet. I wonder when he will start. His future looks bright for him. I can hear the T. V. downstairs. Some cartoon show is playing right now. My roommates are downstairs watching it. I can see my keys from where I'm sitting. They are attached to the Pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. Actually I have two key chains. The other one is of PROPNAME. A total stranger gave it to me one day and I've never seen him since. I like to think that it was PROPNAME himself, giving me strength when I needed it the most last year. I was feeling down and out last year. I was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. He walks up to me and gives me the key chain. He tells me that Jesus will never turn his back on me. So every time I look at the key chain, I think of Him and it gives me strength. School is finally underway now. I hope that I do good this year. Anyway, the 00 mins are up. Hopefully I'm doing this right. I know that this isn't even for a grade, but I just worry a lot. Speaking about worrying, I'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because I've been calling back to LOCNAME everyday. 
__label__label1 this song is really sweet my computer is slow but it's cool it's doing pretty well for me I should start typing next to each other just in case I run out of room. well that's better. hehe. I don't believe PROPNAME did that. actually I'm not sure if I can write that type of stuff on here. it's kind of personal and what if someone reads this. I don't mind if PROPNAME or PROPNAME reads it. but what if it's someone else. never mind about that. start thinking and type what your thinking wenshi. great now I'm talking to myself. that's funny. well. the songs over. what's next. prem is a really sweet guy and I am very lucky to have him. I'm also very lucky to have friends like PROPNAME, phong, thang,julie, janet, sean, and so many more. and especially lucky to have such a mom and dad and three brothers that really care. they take care of me. they do lots for me. wenjen upgraded this computer that I'm using to type. isn't he so nice. what a brother. it's really cold in our room. I feel like I'm talking to someone. and tell them everything about myself. but I don't think that is what stream of consciousness is. I don't know. well I'll just keep typing until time is up. oh yeah. I need to call PROPNAME and ask her if she has an extra cable for our TV in the room. good thing I wrote sentences right next to each other. this assignment would of been really long if I didn't. I know I don't have to worry about spelling and grammar and all but it kind of bothers me. it's not much the grammar and punctuation but spelling and spacing of words. I guess I'm just anal or something. who knows. I think other people like my friends and family know me better than I know myself. geez that shouldn't like that but I think that's how it is. oh well. hmm. what else should I think about. that's weird I'm thinking about what I'm thinking. hehe confusing. I miss my friends from high school that aren't going to UT. I miss my family too. my hometown isn't that far away compared to others but I still miss my friends and family. wow I don't know how others from out of state or even the country do it. it must be hard for them. I'm worried about mommy she's home all by herself. everyone is at a different place. wow. but in October all of us should be together. I can't wait until that day comes. it's going to be so cool. it hasn't been like that for more than a year. my goodness only 00 minutes have passed. I have written a lot in 00 minutes. geez. and 0 more at least. wow. I wish all papers in all my classes would be this easy. I mean it's not easy but easier than other writing assignments. you don't have to worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and just about everything else. just need something on paper. what kind of paper is that. I think I'm in paper heaven. hehe. that's like the coolest thing. I wish other teachers would be so generous. what happened to my music. I didn't pick this to be in my file or play list editor to play music continuously. but it's still a good song. I didn't even know it was in the file. that's pretty cool. actually kind of weird. hmm. I wonder how long it's been now. my hands are kind of getting tired and hard and tense from typing all this continuously. it's actually tough to type so much because you are thinking of so much at a time. it would be easier if I could type faster or my thinking would be less. hehe. that's never going to happen. I have been told I think a lot. and my mommy says I have lots of wrinkles under my feet. she says that means you keep everything to yourself. it's true for me. I don't know about others though. I think that's a cool but weird saying or superstition whatever you want to call it. it is funny too. well. what time is it now. let me look real quick. I started when the time said 0:00 and now when I looked it's 0:00. just one minute away from the minimum time. I'll type a little longer so it's not like I stopped right at 00. well the music stopped. you know what I just realized. I did pick all those songs I thought I didn't pick. that's funny. oh well. well. the playlist is out of songs I have to start it again when I'm done typing which should be ok to be now but let me check just in case the minute isn't over. I don't want to cheat and make it 00. 0 minutes. let me see here. it's 0:00. so I've been typing for 00 straight minutes. wow. my right arm is sore. it really hurts. I guess I should stop now. well nice typing for my first writing assignment in psychology. I'll be writing another one soon for the second writing assignment. well see this page later. hehe. 
__label__label1 I just always feel like I am better off when I get things done. I have found that I have been procrastinating a lot lately and I just want to get things back into order so I can do more fun things. I was happy about passing by the LOCNAME tennis club booth on my way back from class, I am hoping to have time to do that. I really wish I talked to the UT tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do I like tennis, but I am happy bec it will give me a workout. I don't have much time to go to the gym  now and I really want to work out more often. I picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe I will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying I have to do takes up more time than expected, I just feel like I don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight I had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and I just wanted to leave so I could do more imprt things with my time. but I know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec I will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when I went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now I am worried I wont get a spot in a study and I will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since I already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. I will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since I am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then I will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, I should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time I got to register, since I was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. I should have come to an earlier one but I didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so I had to go to the later one, oh well. at least I got classes that are required, I can't get everything I suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone I know, from  my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and I kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though I do miss pewople a lot, I think I am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since I was accepted, I felt like it was a good opportunity and I shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why I came all the way from LOCNAME, florida to texas and I always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. I was just admiring today the fountains - I love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that I have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where I live. those people scare me, and I know I have nothing to be scared of I just don't like seeing them there. anyway, I am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. I hope they have a great trip an safe. I am always worried abt them, I just don't want anything to happen to them. I know my mom is scared of flying and I just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that I got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever I think abt that trip I think abt how I wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips I still did it, I guess I thought they wouldnt care if I did it. that's funny. I guess I am still bitter I didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but I am happy at UT. I hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 00 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 00 - I love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. I miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but I havent gotten it yet, I should call her. but I havent talked to her inso long I think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe I will one day, I guess I should to say thank you when the present comes. or I could send  a card, whatever. I will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 00  minutes is up and I would like to write more but, like I said before, so much to do and so little time. I still ahve to read a million and two pages and I only have 0 classes tomorrow. I just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun! 
__label__label1 I thought I could cry forever and I wanted to until I feel eased and better. I guess that made me feel at least somewhat better since I don't feel as depressed or sad right now. I saw mo and ricky this morning. mo probably thinks I've gotton weird, edged, or I don't know, just crazy and there's something wrong with  me. yeah. there's definitely something wrong with  me. I wanted to talk to him so much. I miss him so much when I don't see him and I don't see him as much or at least I don't try as much to see him or hang out with  him. before hanging out with  him was one of my better comfort or pleasure, but it hurts me now to him. he is, to me, one of my best friend and I care for him a lot. I want the best for him and he doesn't deserve a person like me. I am so confused. I am so depressed. I know that I should talk to people about it but it isn't so easy after all. connie doesn't understand or I know understand her. I tried so hard for her but she seems so insensitive or she is being a jerk on purpose to be insensitive to me. I don't even think she knows what she's doning to me. God please help me to get through this time. I truly believe that only you could help me and pull me through this misery. I miss feeling your awesome love. I feel so lonely. I feel bad but I can't really talk to my mom about this my whole crazy situation. she expects so much out me. she loves me so much that it hurts her so much to see me being like this. but Lord, I really don't know what I can do. I don't think I am capable of doing anything well or at least I don't have any desire to do anything. I thought mom was okay with  elementary education and I thought I could do that, but she says, "no, no!" to it. what can I do?  I really want to be the daughter my parents want me to be. I really want to be a friend all my other friends want me to be. I really want to be a sister sungmin and sungchan want me to be. but most of all, I really really want to be someone that I want to be that will please everyone and the most of all You. I am so confused. Lord I don't know what to do and this makes me a sad, depressed and unhappy person. I don't have any motivation to do anything and this is so hard because the school has already started. whenever I feel like I want to cry or feel down I want to go to certain people like timmy, steve, mo, betty, connie, mom, and etc. but timmy, as much as I want to go to him, I can't for some reason. instead, I'm so mean to him. I don't mean to be. I hope he knows it. I wonder if he still likes me. I sometimes feel like he does, but I don't think so anymore. guys are so frickle. steve. I want to but I can't depend on him too much because he will be married soon and I shouldn't be near him so much. mo. I want to but you are one of my problems. why can't you be just a friend to me. betty and connie. I shouldn't talk to them so much, in fact, I kind of regret telling them so much about me. I shouldn't have. oh well, they are my friends and I hope they don't ruin my trust on them. well, I feel so much better just writing about everyting or most of the things that bothered me for so long. I guess my 00 minutes are up. maybe things will be better today. 
__label__label0 m exdcited. All classes seem interesting. I'm way on top of the medical school admission process and I keep thinking about it. I am so ready for school. summer school was fun this summer, but for some reason I just enjoy havin the challenge of shool on my hands. It makes me feel successful. That's important to me. I have to make sure to stop and smell the roses also, though. I can be kind of bad about forgetting to do that. But then again succeeding in school is one way I smell the roses. Everything here is so exciting. There are so many girls and I really dig that. I have never seen so many girls in my life. But even with the massive amounts of women that are here, my love woes are the same. I'm just too damn picky. Yeah, yeah I know that's supposed to be good and stuff but it gets old. It seems like no girl ever meets the qualifications. It's like the really pretty girls that I am attracted to are stupid as hell. And the ugly girls or mediocre girls I know have the most wonderful personality in the world. What's up with that?   So goes college life. Despite the lack of girls with any character and looks, its still a thrilling experience. I feel sorry for women. I mean they are totally forsaken in almost all aspects of life. They are judged so much more on how they look, and what bugs me about that is I totally participate in all of the judging. So goes manhood. I like to think of myself as much different than other guys. Someone who is more compassionate and has thought things through, but even I revert to complete childish mentalities sometimes. It can be fun though. girls, though, I remember a few weeks ago before a Taekwon-Do testing, in which I was to help judge (I used to be a taekwon-do instructor), one of my good friends who started taekwon-do with me was also invited. her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. The head "male" judges decided that she should watch over the receptionists desk while testing commensed. That was such bullshit. She outrankedhalf of the judges, but just because she wasn't more "assertive" as they put it, she got looked ofver as usual. This fucking pissed me off. I mean, for the first time I realized that this wasn't the first time this has happened to her. Whenever I won a tournament, it was my name mentioned, whenever there was an award tobe given, it was to be, never to her. I know that the instructors didn't do it on purpose, it just never occurred to them to give credit to the lady. And then it hit me, "wow, girls totally get looked over, more than guys. "   Enough about that. I am bored. I want to go play with all of the other college kids in the other room, but no I am disciplined, rooooaaaaarrrr. Anyway, man I hope the ORGNAME go to the series this year, I know that they can beat the braves (maybe). hehe  Oh, I saw this thing on ORGNAME ORGNAME today, that professional basketball player who hit his coach. What a fucking idiot. Man, he was sitting on TV talking about how he was suine the ORGNAME for lost wages. Poor millionare. Something about PROPNAME was very funny, and oh my god, was Saving Private Ryan awsome or what?  I mean that movie freaking changed my life. And Good Will hunting was good too. I liked it partly because it was in LOCNAME, and I would love to go medical school at ORGNAME. I think I have a good shot at getting in if I do well this year and kick ass on the ORGNAME, don't worry I will prepare well. Football, this next Saturday, oh yeah!  I can't wait to enjoy the game witht eh buddies and a few budweisers. That budweiser commercial is hilarious, with the lizards. That is a genious whoever came up with that campaign. There are too many stupid-ass commercial advertisers out there. There should be a law against commercials that suck. Like we could havwe a commercial selection committee that could pass a commercial on a 0/0 vote on regular commercials and by a simple majority with Little PROPNAME commercials. Oh remember that Deep thoughts, by PROPNAME PROPNAME that used to play on Saturday night live?  It was hilarious and this stream of consciousness essay reminds me of that. He would say stuff like, I wonder what the world would be like if dogs ruled the earth. I bet doverman pinchers would control most of the countries, but that would be sad because I'm sure there are some Chiuahauas with some pretty good ideas! hehehehehe, I freaking hate that I don't know how to spell Chiuhua. ahhhhhhhhh! 
__label__label0 I tried three times to get this web site and it kept bringing up that the server was down. I am the mother of a 00 month old and when he goes to bed, that is the time I need to get busy and do my work. I often stay up until 0 or 0 am trying to get everything done that I need to get done. I have the King and I on the TV, I am looking very much forward to going to the Bass concert/ performing arts center to see it. I bought three tickets. My husband and I are going and taking my grandmother for her 00th birthday. it should be a real treat. the house is quiet except the TV (on low) and the dishwasher. I love the sound of the dishwasher. It is a night time sound for me because when I was growing up my mother would turn it on after the news on her way to bed. It is a comforting sound. It was a  normal bedtime noise then, now 00 years ago, and now in my own home I enjoy the sound. I would miss it if we were to get one of those new expensive machines that didn't have the same rolling and tumbling sounds. I love water, the ocean, it kind of reminds me of that, but in thinking about it also probably sounds like being in utero. This musical is so beautiful, I just love the musicals of the past, a time long gone except you can visit through videos, theatre in your mind. Its sort of and escape from daily hectic real life schedules. Speaking of hectic every day schedules, my car is in the shop. It was there today since 0am and at 000pm I hadn't received a call about it yet. I don't think they are very considerate,  I had to call, and if I hadn't would they have closed up and gone home without saying a ***** word to me! probably. In order for me to be in class at noon tomorrow, I need to have PROPNAME at the daycare by 00am . and I have to have a way to get the car. Freddie works night at the post office and he needs to go to bed when he gets home, not fool around waiting to take me down to the ORGNAME service dept. being without your car is a big pain in the butt. It is the air-conditioning , door locks, and electric window. of course, it is the drivers window that is messed up, and when you unlock the door with the key, it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't lock and unlock the real drivers door. and usually it is when I have my arms full of stuff, the baby, and when I am in a hurry. As soon as I am finished, here in a matter of minutes, I can go read the mountain of books I had to get this semester. Man, this assignment is making me sweat. When I complain about things I often feel bad, because I know there are people who have it worse than  I do. We watched TITANIC . broken up in three evenings, it was good, but it made me cry. what a way to die. or lose your family or loved ones. Life is the sweet with the tart. I guess. I am curious what will be achieved from your collection of these stream of consciousness writings. I have more than satisfied the 00 minute requirement now, I would like to print this as a receipt, but guess what? my ink cartridge is out, and it was for the survey too, so I hope I can pull it up again and print it when I get out to buy one, I tried at target last week, but of course, they were out !!! the story of my life. 
__label__label1 I am very disappointed. its been raining all day and I'm tired. I didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. I can't stand not sleeping. Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not good enough for college, or at least ORGNAME. Things have been hectic the whole time I have been on campus, and if I don't do good this semester, I'm going to fail out. I hope that I can pull this all off. The weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. I need to do stuff like that more often. I hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since I liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. I miss high school, sadly enough. I liked school a lot better when it was just me and 0000 other people. I knew everyone, everyone knew me. Life was good. I can't stand this 00k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. I'm lucky to see A friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. Oh well, I hope that life gets better soon. This weekend should be a lot of fun. Oh, my pizza is ready, its been 00 minutes since I sat down. I spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. Same old problem for me. I can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, I suck. 
__label__label0 I tried to get onto your pretest experimental thing and it didn't let me on that's very bad for m e since I will have to waste more damn time tomorrow doing it I heard it takes a long time to do. This whole college thing is really starting to scare me I missed my Si session today for Rtf and let myself down. I f you want to make an impression on these people you have to grab them by the balls with a 0. 0 average. How am I going to do that when I have already missed one of the damn Si's  I'm telling you I better get my act  What am I even doing here I need to get my mind on other things like movies why aren't your thoughts ever on movies they're always on what to do to impress the next person . Just get ahead of thy game early and you'll do fine  God I hope I get a $. 0. $. 0 the way to go. I don't want grad school though LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that's where I'm going to be in a while no matter what. I have it the right stuff. PROPNAME PROPNAME. Good movie. Remember what the guy at ORGNAME said The Right Stuff had god use of parallel editing. where you edit two frames together that are similar in how the shot is set so as not to disrupt the audience's attention. What is the audience's attention . Movies. this paper what am I rambling about I wonder if the proff will read this Jesus you type like a gorilla . PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in the Mist about some ape lady PROPNAME something. Ironic that was in our psychology book. ironic but not funny just ironic sue me I took a pause to see how much time I had left this is all anyway what is it supposed to prove that our mind wanders is it supposed to give us some great insight into how we think  rrAAh. it is pretty fun and it will be interesting to read over this am I supposed to wow I'm a slow typist that sucks. What was it sophomore year that I got a B in keyboarding yeah I told PROPNAME PROPNAME about PROPNAME PROPNAME and we always used to fight each other in class and he'd pretend that I was beating him up why are you and all of these people so concerned about each other especially women is it just to procreate that we are interested in women or is it like Psychology. professor says that there can be different views on the whole thing. Of course dumb question there can be different views on every thing but which is the right one?  time up 
__label__label1 I already wrote a 00 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of PROPNAME PROPNAME and a bit less of PROPNAME PROPNAME in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 00 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary. 
__label__label1 I'm not sure since I've just started College and haven't had any tests yet. I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 00 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. 
__label__label0 Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in LOCNAME for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to ORGNAME and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 00000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 00 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new PROPNAME PROPNAME CD for dad tomorrow and call PROPNAME. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named PROPNAME. Never eat at a place called PROPNAME's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      
__label__label0 I don't have to right in paragraph form or write any sentence structures or even spell right. I don't have to put any grammar or punctuation on this assignment and I can talk about anything. I don't understand what the point of this assignment is and I don't care as long as I finish it. So I guess I'll just keep typing and typing and typing. Right now, I feel an itch so I'll scratch my arm. I'm typing on my friends computer, so he can't use it for at least another seventeen minutes. I don't think understand the point of this assignment. I could do this: and nobody would care. This assignment is just to type for twenty minutes about whatever I think and I keep thinking this over and over again. I don't know what I'm doing and I don't care as long as I finish. I started at 0:00p. M so I'll stop at 0:00p. M. Man it's another fifteen minutes until I finish. I'm tired and I want to go back to sleep. I need to do my laundry, clean the bathroom, do my homework. That reminds me I have so much homework to do. I don't understand anything in calculus and I'm worried about that class. My final is fifty percent of my grade!!!!  I don't understand why some teachers would do that. It's like the semester grade depends on this one test. If you were making an A in the class, before the final, you could end up failing if you really screw up on the final. What kind of class is that???  I don't know but I'm scared. I have to study hard for that final, but first I have to understand the material we're covering right now. I'm so behind. But the good thing about the final is that it's my only final and I have a week to study for it so I should do O. K. I hope I get a B in this class. I don't want to do any homework, and that reminds me that I'm behind in all of my classes!!!!  I have to read so much and I don't like to read. I think I'm going crazy. I need to write this assignment do the second writing assignment, read for Theatre, do Calculus homework, read for this class, do a peer review sheet for English, and chores around the house. So much to do, so little time. Only 0 more minutes to go. Oh, and the pretest survey to see what surveys I will be used in, was messed up. I didn't start reading the top of the survey which tells you what answers to fill in until the middle. So I think the survey thinks I'm a girl, since I answered some FEMALE ONLY questions. Except I checked the male box when it asked whether I was male or female. But it kept on asking me questions that were very feminine. I hope I don't get in trouble for that. But I doubt it, since there will probably be other people who will do the exact same thing I did. There's always somebody else. I hope I don't get put into some strange category or something. What I didn't understand about the survey was that why did it ask some of the same questions over again. I think it had to do something with me answering FEMALE ONLY questions. I don't know if that's why but I answered most all of them except this one question that asked if I was more guilty about eating than most girls. I was like: "Hold up, what's going on?  This survey thinks I'm a girl!"  Damn, well whatever it's O. K. everybody makes mistakes and I'm not going to come down on myself because of that. My friends staring at my assignment right now and saying this is an easy assignment. Well I guess it is, it's just that my fingers are tired. I don't want to type anymore, and I have 0 more minutes left. Yippee!!!!  After this I'm going to take a break and then do writing assignment number 0. After I finish that I'll take a nap and start on Calculus. Oh man, so much work to do!!! I should have started earlier instead of playing these first few weeks of school. Well my time's up. So goodbye!!! 
__label__label1 I don't know what to write about really and I have a bunch of other things on my mind. I haven't eaten breakfast yet and I'm pretty hungry, but I fear that if I don't do this now I might never get around to doing it. the assignment doesn't seem to be that difficult, but sometimes I have trouble thinking of things to say. I'm not going to my calculus study session because I think it will mainly be review of what I have already learned in high school. my roommates friend PROPNAME just called and somewhat interrupted my thoughts. I don't think my roommate likes PROPNAME very much but I don't know that for sure. he always calls when my roommate isn't here which to me is a signal that they're not really in sync. when I feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we're in sync with each other. I think that the more time you spend with a person the more you become somehow linked to that person. I've been waiting to read a book for some time now and my friend just finished and gave it to me. I think everyone should read Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do: the absurdity of consensual crimes in our free country by peter mcwilliams. not only is it a very controversial book, but it is also humorous and very informative and educational. PROPNAME PROPNAME has AIDS, cancer, and was using marijuana for medicinal purposes under LOCNAME state law, but was arrested and thrown in jail. I agree with mcwilliams 000% about consensual crime being ridiculous and I think it's wrong that he's in jail now. I got fined $00 recently for parking in lot A00 next to Jester. the parking and traffic administration expects me to park on the other side of red river, or better yet i00. I think this is stupid and am very upset with this,  I plan on writing a letter of complaint to PROPNAME PROPNAME. my parents finally came to their senses and bought me a computer for school. that is one of the main reasons I am able to do this assignment now. I didn't feel comfortable writing these kind of personal thoughts in a computer lab full of other people. my parents got a good computer for a low price and now I can work from my dorm room, so I think everyone is satisfied. I just wonder if having a computer will be another hindrance to meeting new people especially girls. not that there aren't plenty of girls that use computers, but I don't really get out enough as it is. I know it's up to me to make the effort but I almost feel trapped in a situation where I don't meet enough girls or hang around them enough. 
__label__label0 He became my good friend and we had an understanding, we connected. He left this morning. We saw him off. His mom was there so the send off wasn't so bad. The other guys are afraid to show emotion. They've got this macho, I'm afraid to feel attitude. They're smart and all but maybe not as expressive as my close friends back home. Guess that comes with time. The cheebye had to leave so damned fast. 0 week and one day's notice was all he had. And all of us, especially me, feel so betrayed. We had great plans for this summer and the fall. At least I'll be seeing him in december when I fly back home. I like stuffed toys. Beanie babies rock! but. I have to watch my spending, yeah, too many beanies'll break my bank! college isn't all that cheap. I'm not a  loaded person. I've got to think about my budget for this month. sheesh, I've  already overspent and am going to be stretched till october. cheebye!  I wonder if anybody's going to read this rambling. if somebody is, hmmmm. you can  call me. I'm "new" to america and don't have any american friends. sad isn;t it? but that is the case. what's the point of going overseas for an education if you  don't imerse youself into the country's culture.   oh well. I've got lot's of things to do now. like get my "lunch". I'm starving. hmmm.              
__label__label1 I just don't feel like I have quite gotten into the groove of school yet. I hate that we start before labor day, because I feel like I am just getting my schedule back to normal when I get another vacation. I think I'm going home to see my mom this weekend, my birthday is tomorrow and hers is on Monday so were going to have a girls weekend, shopping, makeovers, haircuts, I can't wait. I wish that PROPNAME was coming with me though, I hate to travel by myself, especially flying, I'm glad the flight only takes an hour but I really do not like to fly. I can't imagine going to LOCNAME and being on a plane for an entire day, I would want to jump out, it just makes me feel trapped at least when your in the car you can stop along the way for a travel break. anyway, besides getting ready for this weekend, I have a lot of homework I need to finish, so I can have fun while I'm home, my horoscope told me today was a good housecleaning day, I've been needing to do that ever since PROPNAME's party, so I better do it today, or ill have to wait till the next full moon, or favorable planetary alignment!:)  I don't really believe in horoscopes, but I still read them, especially around my birthday, silly superstition I guess, my horoscope for this week said I should do something memorable and kind of crazy for my birthday. I'm thinking that's not such a bad idea. I've only got a couple more years left that its still socially acceptable for me to be irresponsible. what crap, I hope I'm doing pseudo-irresponsible (not life-threatening and stupid, just fun)  until I'm very, very old. its so weird that I would want to be like that, because I don't think I give off that image to the world. actually taking risks really scare me and I avoid them in real life as much as possible, but my rich a varied fantasy life is full of them. this should give you a clue to how type a I am, my fantasies about taking risks usually just include planning them, hardly ever actually doing them. where was I? oh yeah birthday, so I'm kind of bummed out bc I gave PROPNAME a really great party and bought him lots of presents bc at the time we had money, but surprise his stupid company hasn't paid him yet so right now a great birthday present for me would be to pay the bills. I'm feeling a little guilty about the way I spent money on him, when I sort of knew what the situation would be, but I can't do anything about it now, and I feel like its selfish of me to want him to reciprocate what I did for him. I guess that's my spoiled only child coming out. I really did have fun watching him opening his presents and enjoying his party, I didn't do those thing so he would do the same for me, but I would be nice! okay back to school I'm feeling okay about most of my classes even chemistry, but I do not want to fail calculus again! that would suck, I already dislike the prof's teaching style. I know he wants us to learn by understand the proofs, he thinks that doing tons of problems for practice, which is what I like, is a "high school" way to learn,  he actually really gets on my nerves. I really don't care about understanding calculus, I don't even have to take the second part, I just want to memorize formulas and pass the tests, too bad it doesn't seen to work like that in his class. I guess if I just keep up with it should be okay, that was my problem last semester, I just kept getting further and further behind, and tried to cram the night before the final. that works in my liberal arts classes, but in none of my science classes, which I guess in a strange way is why I like them. when I enjoying what I'm learning I don't mind reading everyday, and usually by the end of the semester I can really apply what I've learned in broader terms. it was really cool to see that a lot of the methodology and general theories I learned in my ecology classes were also used in psy. calculus is not one of those things I feel like I'm going to enjoy 
__label__label1 I am happy that I made the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I am cautious about my future and what I want to get involved in. I want to become a Texas Wrangler but I am unsure that they will take me. I want to do well in school and get in to law school. I don't study as much as I want to, and I need to work on that. I love sports and I like football most of all. I wish I had played football was a kid. I am excited about the future of our country and I want to get involved. I don't understand what this assignment is about, but I will write everything that is on my mind. I worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. I try to be the best student and person that I can be. I have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way I have been raised. I've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and I try to be the best at everything. I knew that is bad, but I feel that that is the way I was born. I believe our President is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. He is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. I have a roommate that is good. He is Norwegian and is a great student. He is fun to hang out with and we get along well. I have a girlfriend and I'm not sure if we should stay together. We get along well, but I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. ,  WE share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. My parents are strong Christians, but ?I am not sure that that is what I want. College is a time to figure all of this out, and I am glad I am here. It is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. I am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. I want to be an attorney and I feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. I want to be the best that I can be and make a good future for myself. My Mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. It is a lot of pressure from her, and I try to be a role model for my younger brother. He is a trouble maker, and I want to be a positive influence in his life. He is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. I love my family very much. I can't wait for the UT ORGNAME football game. I love the game and I love the school spirit it provides. I was an engineering major at ORGNAME ORGNAME last year and I made the switch to UT all by myself. I am proud of that move, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the best move I've ever made. I like the big school here and the number of students here. I want to run for public office when I get older and make this country a better place. I feel like I can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. I am a good person, and I believe others will think so too.  
__label__label1 I still do not understand why my father after twenty years of marriage to my mother decides out of the blue that he is not happy and to get a divorce. why he feels that he needs to be with that other slut. my mother has been a great wife to him and without her he would probably be nowhere today. he thinks that just because he will give her money that she will be okay without him. but money can't buy happiness. I just hope that my little brother is a okay he is only twelve years old and he gets sad when he thinks about his dad not being there I just do not know how I am going to be ready for my test on Wednesday I have to study way too much for the next two days and I need to get an a in biology I need to do good in all of my classes to raise my ORGNAME I just  hope that my mom does good on her test also because she has been working hard to make the grade my little brother has been working hard in football to get the starting position with his little friends I wish that could just go back to being a little kid when everything was okay with my parents and I did not have to worry about anything but just being a little kid I would not need to worry about anything hopefully he will come back to his senses and come back home 
__label__label0 I can't stand how removed the users are from the control of the system. With internet explorer I can't even get it to work with trumpet Winsock, so if I want to use IE then I have to go down to the computer center and pay them a bunch of money for the ORGNAME connect system when I already have trumpet Winsock that has always worked fine in the past. now with ORGNAME I keep having a completely different problem, there are several times that I go to web pages that I know are there and they aren't for example I tried to go to the pretesting WebPages and I soon as I sent my social security number out over the web, which I'm not especially happy about having to do, it tells me that the document has no data. The same thing has happened before when I try to log on to the ORGNAME house website. I consider myself a pretty smart person, but I cannot figure out at all what the hell is going on with this stupid then. I know I have to go down to campus and use a computer down there for 00 minutes to do the pretesting. and why the hell is it when you connect to UT and go on the web the connecting is so freaking slow. I swear UT must have some really outdated equipment down there because my download speeds never get over 0 K. that's ridiculous. but this is the way at UT. When you go to a school with 00000 students everything takes a little longer and your chances of having to deal with an idiot are raised considerably. I think I have an especially low tolerance for stupid people. Uneducated is different but there seem to be a lot of people out that that are truly student I think, and they frustrate the hell out of me. It's not that I'm a genius of something, but there are some real idiots out there. There is this girl in my engineering economics class that sits up in the front and will ask questions that make no freaking sense at all. How in the hell does someone get to be an upper division engineering major and be so stupid. obviously it happens through, although most of the really stupid people that I have to deal with come from working at ORGNAME. I guess that's my own fault, it's not like I should expect anything else. When I was a ORGNAME we would have some cashiers that I have not idea at all how they got hired. I think personnel hires anyone with a pulse sometimes, I mean if the person sitting across the table from you just has this completely blank look on their face, that's a good sign that you shouldn't hire them. Another thing that bugs me are all the stupid laws regarding alcohol in this country. I mean either it should be legal or it should, but alcohol seems to be the only think that is legal to some of the adults and only part of the time. I mean were are talking about adults, some of them may not be especially bright but they still are adults. if 00 is good enough for every thing else then it should be good enough for alcohol. you can get married, go to jail, go to war, own property, get a gun, hell anything that any other adult does except drink. seems pretty backwards to me. something else that is freaking stupid and at the very least unfair is the way that car insurance companies can completely screw over guys. when a girl turns 00 she gets a good rate, but a guy has to wait until he is 00, hello but most of the really awful drivers that I have ever been around are women, they are  the ones that pay no attention at all to what is going on around them. but since older people control the laws etceteras the younger people are going to continue to get screwed over, I think they should make people over 00 pay the same rates as 00 year olds, that would be funny. oh well out of time, it's been real 
__label__label0 Ok I'm thinking about old school ORGNAME man those were the days, my friend PROPNAME had a lot more game than I did but I did not meet him till 0th grade and until then I though I had a lot of games, which I guess is saying your happy with what you got till some on else gets more than you and then jealousy sets in but id like to think I've grown somewhat sense then . I remember a science tech class I used to take in 0th grade. all years go back to 0000 almost everything has some tie in my mind to 0000 I don't know why and It pops up o very often. It's Like velma from scooby do all cartoons go back to PROPNAME, I guess you'd have to see Cartoon network to understand it, m thinking of my mom It's odd but I sometimes worry that she worries too much about me, she was really overprotective but very loving, and now I still have feelings like hatred for being held back by her over protectiveness. SO whenever we are together I try to make sure she doesn't think I turned out goo because some how I still feel a grudge against her methods and think I missed out too much when I was little. nnnnnnnnnnnn captain N that was a cool cartoon. hmmm I wonder I caryn is around or PROPNAME they are kind of friends of my best friend so It kind of awkward but I think they really like me more than I deserve because PROPNAME always says things to them about me and well I'd like to get to know them better but It awkward because he was friends with them first . I reorganized my room this ear it pretty cool. Something you just don't turn in for a grade even if you think it wont be read but just let it be known I'm thinking f those things. well enough of that what is on my mind. the lawnmower man. that doctor guy who look like a gu from that x-files rip off kieger or something. the At tem a crack force of firearms specialist design to heighten an experience, if I can't even understand now that was true stream of conscience I lost complete control let me try again, Hotdogs, mustard, ice cream, maybe I'm hungry, barbecue chips, why the hell did I just think of feminine hygiene product , milk ducts, cows, chickened, crunch, superheroes, dad comics, pride, going monkey zoo hen turkey target where I work love in the zoo with oink hungry I ran and bombings in LOCNAME contra scandal the e president a cool president I like if only to be rebellious and also the PROPNAME's stereotypical drinkers which I will be partaking in he festivities to night but you know that's ok I guess I finally got that damned questionnaire filled out after I thought it had not saved because it read 0% when I logged in again but I guess I was just being an ass. I don't like it when I'm ignored I know I act stupid and say silly things a lot but oh well that guy PROPNAME next door is doing something Damn I think I really want a girlfriend again it really sucks not being able to act straight around girls I just have to stop being shy and be suave but less rryohoyoho a pirates life for me and al I can say is that the future is looking bright and I've got to got rrahhh rrahhh run away tommyboy is a really good movie despite what people might say I think it s really funny at a lot of parts well looks like my time is running up so I ill go tell no one or else I will probably be embarrassed. 
__label__label1 john is talking a lot. I don't care if a lot is supposed to be 0 separate words. I like this song. wow It's already been 0 minute. I guess I just think slowly. hmmm, my mind just went blank. oh crap, I have 0 classes tomorrow. did I finish all my homework yet?  oh shit, I have a lot of calculus to catch up on. I've only done like 0 assignment out of 0!  PROPNAME is talking to PROPNAME and it's interrupting my stream of consciousness. hey. if you're unconscious, and you have a dream, is that stream of Unconsciousness??  hahaahahaha  that's a cool thought!!   ahhahahha!! oh cool, my friend is online!  she was at the party on Saturday that I dj'ed. I thought I dj'ed crappy ORGNAME everyone says I ORGNAME like a club DJ. I wish I could DJ ORGNAME but ORGNAME is owned by DJ boombai. I wonder if he's any good. he uses records instead of CD's. I hear he spins hip hop. I guess I have a chance since I mix club music and not hip hop. PROPNAME is instant messaging me!  argh, I've written so much and it's only been 0 minutes. do I really have to do this for 00 minutes?  this is pretty brainless. I wish all writing assignments were like this. wow it's late already. I go to sleep too late everyday. I better go to sleep early. all we do is watch TV. marc mcgwire broke the homerun record today. that's pretty cool. I wonder how PROPNAME sosa feels. I bet he's happy for him but deep inside he was like "damn, I almost had it!"  he still has a chance though. wow my bed is messy. the covers are like everywhere. I like my posters. chow yun-fat's gun is cool looking. Acura integra is such a cool car, especially the type R. I wish I had a type R. after college, I want to get a type R. I wonder if I'll be rich after college. I hope I'm rich. I wonder what my future will be like. I wonder if I'll be living in an apartment or a house. I wonder when I'll get married. I want to get married around 00 - 00. I wonder who I'll marry. I wonder if it'll be my girlfriend right now. I really like her a lot. I can't imagine being without her. she was at the party on Saturday too. I wonder if anyone else will get me to DJ their parties. I hope so - I want to make some extra money. what the hell kind of song is this?  mp0's are the coolest things!  I can download them for free and burn them onto a CD and make my own favorite CD's. I might go for a masters degree. I might get more money. I know!  when I get my bachelors, I'll look for a high paying job. then if I don't get a good job, I'll go back for the masters. I can imagine myself as a traveling type of businessman, getting up early in the morning, taking a shower, putting on my armani suit, kissing my wife goodbye, driving my PROPNAME to work, coming back in rush hour traffic, and doing it all over again. ooh how long has it been?  it's been 00 minutes. cool!  I'm almost done with this one. I wonder how long the next assignment is. I still have to do that pretesting thing. PROPNAME and PROPNAME have been gone for a long time. I wonder when they'll be back. I wonder what they're doing. did they work out or hoop?  my girlfriend is a private investigator. hahhahhahaa  lethal weapon 0 was a cool movie. jet li is awesome. he kicks ass. I wonder if I'll have time to take martial arts next year. should I take capoeira or kung fu with my because?  I hate this song. john's taking a shower. something is beeping. my contacts are dry. I want to play starcraft. that's a fun game. I like to build up and overwhelm the opponent. oop, times up. 
__label__label0 homework in the midst of my pre-cal assignment because my pre-cal is too long and really rather boring. plu, I need to catch up because I didn't start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing a little each night, my mistake. I hope to finish this writting assignment, the pre-test, my pre-cal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow. it's a lot but it will catch me up. then tomorrow I can begin my new pre-cal assignment and I can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary I can catch up on more psy. and pre-cal thursday evening. I'm also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday. james is a very good friend of mine and whenever I need to talk or unload my thoughts, james is excellent. plus, I'll put in a good couple of hours at my intern. david is going to teach me how to use my dad's camera and stuff so that sunday I can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed. then, I'll have those pictures to play with and I plan on getting some of my negativesput on a cd disk so I can manipulate those pictures also. I have a very busy life going right now. I don't know how I cram it all in sometimes, but honestly, I like to have something to do at all times. I don't know why, I'm not very good at sitting still alone. only if I'm watching t. v. or something. I'll get my new job schedule on thurs. I just changed jobs because I was tired of working at the old one, that and I hadn't received a raise in a year. the sad thing is, I don't know if I'll be getting paid any more at this new place. as long as I don't take a pay cut I'll stay, I just need a new enviroment with new things to do. I'll be working at bath and body works, I think it'll be fun, because I like the things they sell there and I get to be the saleswomen. I enjoy selling things to people. my managers seem nice also. I might have to work at five in the morning a few times a year and I'm not looking forward to that at all. I've never done inventory before so I don't know what it involves, but I don't see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if we'd be more productive a little later, even seven sounds more reasonable. I'd rather not worry about that until I know for sure that I'll be going in that early. I wonder what you're gather from all of my ramblings? five more minutes to go. I don't know how this is suppose to go, whather I should just write waht's on my mind or as if I'm talking to you at the other end. I gues in the end they're both going to get you the same stream of con. types of thoughts, huh?  I hope I can log onto the pre-test when I'm done with this, I tried it first and the server wouldn't let me on, yours or mine I don't know, I don't like computers much any how. I guess this was as good a way as any to put off the rest of my pre-cal since I'm being productive in the mean time. I could have gone and watched tv, or read my book (not some school assignment. ) well now, that wasn't hard at all, I guess I'm good at rambling. my time's up.  
__label__label1 this is really weird. what am I doing here. what am I supposed to write about. who came up with  this assignment anyway. well whatever. ill just do it and ill get the credit and that's it. I wonder where nauman is right now. I called him but no answer. where could he be. I had fun this weekend. I think. well it was better then what I normally do, stay home and watch tv. I wonder what PROPNAME and LOCNAME are up to. I don't spend anytime with  friends anymore. I want to go back to LOCNAME and see everyone. well I guess I can do that this weekend when I go back. its hot in here. its so hot everywhere. well actually I don't want to go back home this weekend. in a way I do, and in a way I don't. I feel like I'm keeping a journal. oh crap I think my contacts are about to pop out. see if I go home this weekend, then I will be giving up freedom. but if I don't go home this weekend then, my parents will be like why don't you want to come home?  do you like austin that much that you don't even want to come see your family anymore??  which of course is not true. I actually don't like austin. well it smells everywhere in austin. dobie smells, dobie garage smells, ORGNAME smells, ORGNAME smells, everywhere, austin stinks, literally. I wonder how farzana and PROPNAME are at LOCNAME. I'm glad they came down this weekend. otherwise I would have been bored off my butt. you can really count on family to be there for you when you need them. but sometimes it can be really annoying. like my mom, everyday, what did you do, did you go to class, did you eat, what did you eat. it gets on my nerves. but I love her. I guess I am kind of looking forward to going home. I mean I get to see all my friends again. and sabeen is going to ORGNAME so I can say bye to her to before I leave. but I think the hardest thing to do will be the transitions on Friday and Sunday. I'm here now and I want to stay here, not keeping moving again and again. I hate change. and then if I go home this weekend, then ill have to pack and say goodbye to everyone on Sunday, and I hate good-byes. they are so sad and then when I'm say bye, ill want to come back to LOCNAME, and ill hate austin even more. that's why I don't want to go back. this feels kind of good like typing all this. maybe ill start keeping a log or something so I can put all my thoughts in it. my hands are getting tried now. I never realized how long 00 mins really was. how much longer do I have?  0 more mins. great. where in the hell is PROPNAME?  what is he doing?? I'm going to call him after this and see if he's there now. he better be. I miss him. I wonder if he misses me too. I hope so. when is he coming back to austin. I could go see him this weekend, but we both know that's not going to work. his friends are all going home this weekend so he'll want to spend time with  them and his parents are out of town so I'm sure he'll want to go out with  them. but then what about me? What about unlimited weekends??? rrahhh. this is frustrating. I wonder if he is still in love with  him old girlfriend. I think he is. but whatever. I don't care. he can be in love with  him old girlfriend. who cares. I'm just going to let things happen. I mean that is the best way right. you can't make someone fall in love with  you. actually I myself don't know if I really like him. its weird. when I'm not with  him, I really want to be with him and when I'm with him, its just ok. I mean I do like spending time with  him, he's really funny and the time flies when where together, but its just not what I expect it to be. I guess it will just take time. ok 0 more mins. great. that wasn't that bad. I guess ill do the other assignment tomorrow since you can't do both on one day. I have so much to do today. that stupid BA 000 assignment is due today and I have to d the prestesting for psy, but the stupid WebPages isn't working for it. just my luck, since I want to use it, its not working. I wonder if I really have to read those 0 books for class tomorrow. if we do, I'm screwed. I wonder what PROPNAME and charu look like. he talks about them all the time. I wonder if I met them, what they would think of me and what he has told them about me so far. where is he. let  me go call him right now!  should I email him?  Well if I could ever get my stupid email to work, I would. how come he doesn't email me?  oh yeah , wait he does doesn't he. I don't know how he emailed me when he was here. I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was him. I don't think at least. I mean he had a girlfriend and everything going. how did he do it? well whatever it was, I'm glad he did. ok good times up. 
__label__label1 At my high school I graduated with a class of 00, and most of my classes were comprised of 0 to 00 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 000 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy "college life". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to ORGNAME ORGNAME last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. 
__label__label1 I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like LOCNAME is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend PROPNAME. She is at ORGNAME but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with ORGNAME. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at ORGNAME but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in LOCNAME. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the ORGNAME, and LOCNAME is LOCNAME' little piece of LOCNAME. I am going back home to PROPNAME in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. 
__label__label0 The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 0 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in LOCNAME. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at LOCNAME it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. 
__label__label1 THE FUNNY THING IS HE DOESN'T SEEM VERY WORRIED ABOUT IT. I HAVE A CALCULUS TEST THURSDAY AND I'M REALLY SCARED! IT is MY FIRST TEST AND ITS MY HARDEST CLASS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THERE. THIS FRUSTRATES ME BECAUSE USUALLY I'M VERY GOOD AT MATH. I'M HOPEFULLY GOING TO GET TUTORED BEFORE THE TEST. WALKING AROUND CAMPUS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO ME . THERE IS ALL THESE PEOPLE SWARMING AROUND EVERYWHERE ,EACH ONE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT. IT SCARES ME BECAUSE I FEEL AS THOUGH I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE. IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS VERY EASY TO BE NOTICED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL ONLY HAD ABOUT 0,000 PEOPLE IN IT. I WAS INVOLVED IN MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS, BUT I AM THE ONLY ONE OUT OF MY GROUP OF FRIENDS TO BE HERE. IT STILL SEEMS VERY WEIRD TO ME. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL THIS PRESSURE TO SUCCEED HERE FROM MY PARENTS. ITS LIKE 'DON'T SCREW UP' IS CONSTANTLY GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. MY PARENTS SEEM TO BE WAITING FOR ME TO SCREW UP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER . WELL, GOT TO GO DO MORE ASSIGNMENTS. ------    
__label__label0 that's  a typical girl response I guess I still have about fifteen minutes left I tried right before this to take the pretest again. the first time I only got as far as the 00th question and it wouldn't let me continue now it says the line is busy or something like that I don't mind volunteering for experiments and I understand that experimenting is essential for the psychology students but I think that it is wrong for the department to force us to do this or they will block our grade and I have already been to mezes twice to try to sign up and there was no space left and the only space left was for males only so it's just a little frustrating I'm trying to think I don't type very well because it has been so long since I had to type anything I can't remember when I wrote an essay last my high school was a joke we only had 0 classes at a time for an hour and a half per class every day and we had finals four times a year although I usually exempted them you don't know how glad I am to be out of high school I really didn't like it there too much that might have something to do with the fact that we had 0000 students on one campus I really enjoy attending ut although I don't have a major yet everyone says that's okay but I would really like to get onto taking courses that specifically interest me I'm thinking about majoring in government with a minor in german but I might go into political science it's whatever I've so many ideas of what "I want to be when I grow up" that even includes psychology like everybody and their mom wants to do. I have about five minutes left I'm still hungry and after this I'm going to try to take the pretest again. yesterday I moved from the 00th floor of jester west to the 0th floor my roommate never showed up and this girl PROPNAME's roommate also never showed up so I moved into her room she's really nice and this is so weird: we are so alike she even has my birthday she lives in LOCNAME city which is right outside LOCNAME where I live pretty nifty huh so we're going to go shopping and decorate our room some more it's going to look really cool I'm still hungry and I really don't want to eat that nasty jester food but I might as well because I already paid for it well not really the bill comes later this month anyway my 00 minutes is up and I'll be back here tomorrow to do assignment number two 
__label__label0 college is amazing. my room, roommate, suitemates are all amazing. however, that call home always does it. I'm so in love yet my dad has to bring me down. I understand I'm only 00 and that they're thousands of fish in the sea, however, I'm in love with this one. I know I am because when I'm with her I'm the happiest man alive. yet at the moment, my feelings are so far removed from her. I understand that this is my father in my brain and my rational thinking has overcome my emotional side. he says not to let her visit, however, I must see her. he will not stop my but he's trying to open me up to the thousands of women here at ORGNAME. I don't know, I think about it every day. she's different then the girls I've ever been with. I guess, she's different then the girls my parents want me to be with. she is poor and has nothing to offer, yet I'm so in love. and I know. never have I felt this way for a girl before in my life. I would do anything for her, I mean. this assignment of writing for 00 minutes is nothing. I could sit here for 00 hrs weighing the pros and cons and just keep writing. its not  a difficult task. she is not causing me to be depressed. you know?  how people can sometimes get all depressed over their long distance relationships and stress out. I am eating like a madman as always. going out at night, WITH GIRLS, and partying. you know?  I get my homework done and study hard. I work out, pledge my freaking frat and play lacrosse. I'm doing everything and performing well for me as well as my parents so why the fuck can't I just be allowed to have the one woman in life that makes me happy. I understand that I'm young, yet this relationship is not difficult for me. its the second time I've ever been in a long distance relationship. the first one was a bust and I vowed to never do it again. so this past summer  I went to camp sabra at the lake of the ozarks to be a counselor. well, I wasn't intending on meeting anyone, however, I believe 000% that that word called 'fate' has true meaning. the first day we hit it off. I wasn't intending on anything. all I wanted to do was have a productive summer and come to ORGNAME free of love. however, you can't control love when it is real. it just happened. and I don't regret however I sometimes wonder if I didn't have her, what life for me would be like. I mean, I'm with all my buddies. they don't have girl friends or anything coming into UT and its not like they've all of a sudden found someone. I understand its only the first week, but I truly believe that what I've shared with this gorgeous somewhat deprived southern belle from LOCNAME is impossible to ever experience with anyone else. of course I could experience love with another baby, but do I really want too?  I mean, there is no way that the things we have been through together can ever be replayed. I know deep down inside that I am in love with this girl. its tough because she's not here. but what if she was here?  lets say she ends up going to UT or acc, as talked about next year?  what if my girlfriend is here dad?  what if she lives in LOCNAME?  then what, I mean I've got a girlfriend at school now, right?  its not like this is killing me. or maybe it is. look, I'm in love. I know I am. with my love, I have no worries whatsoever. I don't think about anything else when I'm with her. I'm completely content. so get off me. I'm planning on keeping my studies up the whole year, I've signed with a wonderful fraternity, I'm playing lacrosse for the university of Texas-Austin. I have an active social life. not to brag, you know. but I'm doing everything a college boy should be doing: I'm enjoying myself, and to let this get in the way is ridiculous. one must understand, this situation is not in the way. its not holding me back from talking to other girls. however, I do not become intimate with these ladies. so what?  I'll be fine, I will see my love when we visit. I just don't understand. its very stressful, but I'm handling it. you see, my older brother went through the same kind of shit, but he screwed up. he wasn't able to function and messed around freshmen year in college and ended up on academic probation. I thought, damn what if that happens to me?  but its not a worry. I'm at college, its awesome, and I'm doing just fine. we're not holding on to each other. we are in love and have so many dreams we want to fulfill. its not like I'm crying all day to my buddies that I missed her. I rarely ever do that. I'm 000% functional. you know?  I don't know, I really don't know what the hell I just spattered out. I'm in love g-d damn-it. and I'm happy. I just have to relax and get my father's controlling voice removed from my head. I hope I fulfilled the assignment. its been 00 minutes of continuous writing. guess what, my mind still tells me I'm in love. ain't that the darndest thing. alright, time to go ponder. maybe I'm relieved now. see you. 
__label__label0 I have gone to three computer labs this morning, and have gotten screwed out of all of them. It started over at the ORGNAME, where I signed up for a Mac, but saw a free scanner, When I sat down and logged in at the scanner, I realized my other assignment had come up. I decided to logout of the scanner because you're not supposed to use a scanner computer if you're not going to scan anything. So I went over to my assignment, but it was someone else's computer!  So I decided to sign up again (disgruntled). This time, though, the line was about a mile long (not really, but still REALLY long). About half way through the line, and a few minutes later, I realize that I had been assigned to a different computer, but my time was almost up. So I ran over to the computer and quickly typed in my password, but it wouldn't take it. I desperately attempted to logon before my time was up, but the insolent computer would not give it up!  Now a little less than happy, and a little more than frustrated, I went back to the line. Only this time it was at least twice as long. NO!  I remembered though, my MISS professor talking about a business lab, so I went over to the CBA. Of course it was on the 0th floor, and one of the escalator's was broken, but I made it up there; just to find out I had to sign up and wait a day so they knew I was a business student. How asinine!  So I signed up (trying to dig my pen into the page) and proceeded to the good old PROPNAME laboratory, where there is always room to work. There were plenty of computers when I arrived, so I sat down (a little relieved) and pulled up Netscape. The soul purpose of my computer escapades was to check my email and to do this darned project, so I tried to get into my account. "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". What? "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?" Damn it. Of course, the computer couldn't do email. SO I switched. Same song, second verse. I tried three others, and still the same chorus: "THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?". So I accepted the fact that somebody doesn't want me on email. I'm now trying to drudge through this assignment without breaking anything. And yes, time flies when you're having fun, but it moves as slow as hell when you're pissed off, wet, and hungry. That's about the only thing I have to look forward to now: eating. Luckily I packed myself a lunch today. Last time I neglected that responsibility and was forced to eat at ORGNAME's. $0, and I felt like cap for the rest of the day. I'm trying to stay healthy. You see, last semester, I worked out really hard, and got pretty buff before the end of school, but throughout the summer, I lost access to the gyms, and I lost a lot of my muscle mass. Now I am struggling to get back in the swing of things, and fast food really sets me back!  You can add that to the list of anxieties, too. Working out for the first week is always hell, but now I'm on Creatine, and I am twice as sore. Of course, now my hands are hurting from typing straight for 00 minutes, but that is bearable. I guess I sound like quite the whiner, but I am really an easy going guy. I always try to have a pleasant disposition; I really do, I walk around making a constant effort to keep a smile on my face ( It also makes it easier to wink at the girls). But today, things just aren't going well. I really wanted to check that email because I'm supposed to be getting a message from this GORGEOUS girl. But oh well, maybe my lack of correspondence will serve as "playing hard to get". Well, 00 minutes is up, and my hands need a rest!  Hope this is what you all wanted! 
__label__label0 Mom shpuldn't worry about me not being htere to answer the phone-I just missed her is the funny part. I wonder if dad misses me as much as Crystal dad does her. Care bear watch. That was interesting activity in theatre class-I loved that girl's folder from LOCNAME. I wonder if that director thinks I totally butchered PROPNAME. My monolague who cares. Why does PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME's sucha  tomboy-adn I'm not saying that because I think he's cute too, but because she is-but that'sn mena she's really sweet also. Sort of. I need to study for this biology class. I've got to get ahead on my reading. Psychology is so differetn from the way0 my mind works-I'm a math and science person. I think with  numbers and diagrams. Crystal wants to be a psychology major-that noise is bugging me it sounds like a cd player  being loaded and unloaded. That guy I talked to the other day is such a hottie. Floor 00 I think-I might just have to get lost up there. Got I need to read!!!Luke is so cute for writing me-why is it my ex can't say more than three words to me but his best friend can send letters and everything. Math class in a bit-my teacher is so bizarre. Really quirky- but just not all there. WHat is this complex that I have with people in a authority-I mean why just because they are over me do I find them attractive-it's so weird. I can't wait to see PROPNAME PROPNAME next weekend. watch him be out of town or gone. That was a mistake. But, it was bound to happen. Why have I not really gotten homesick? is there something wrong with  me?Everyone I know has had some brush with  this , but I'm still fine-and, I lloove my family and there just wonderful. I need to call the Greek life board, the coppertank, and get that ink for my computer, let's see. can't call to this weekend with  the phone and trent has no wayt of hearing from me. IK wonder if a lot of people are going outb of town for labor day weekend? last year we went camping I was with  PROPNAME then--he was a sweetie, but the breath thing got in the way. Is that shallow of me-I can't wait to see the people who were cast for this play? It's so highgly competitive. But there's sucha  rewarding feeling when you step out of that room knowing good and well that you produced something from your imagination and hard work and effort. I wonder if this is enough. HOw would they know if I stopped at 00 or 00 minutes-BUT I WON"T STOP UNTIL 00 MINUTES HAS ELASPED!!=) I'm starting to get hungry and some how I need to trek to rlm from here-I need to find the cam pus loop schedule. It's so quiet in this library I love it. This is the only place I can really study everyone is loud on our floor do they ever study or did they sign up for some course I don't know about. I'm so proud of myself I haven't gone out at all this week. Does PROPNAME really like PROPNAME if he sayus he loves her that's such crap. Oh well time up, bye. 
__label__label1 I never thought that college would be this overwhelming. I went to three classes today and I went ho0me and cried. How can I keep up with everything?  I went through Band Week and I sometimes ask myself is band worth it. When I am tired and sweating and just want to go home, I think of my parents and how they can brag in my little home town and the feelings of walking through the tunnel at the game and see 00,000 plus fans. At home 0,000 was the biggest turn out and that was big enough. I am very nervous about the first game. Where I am from our school marches military and LOCNAME marches more corps. I just know that I am going to mess up. I am all excited about school only being thirteen weeks long but fear that one and a half years of high school work equivalency are jam packed into these thirteen weeks. Good news though. I only have two finals. That is marvelous. I have to take a dumb SAT II test Thursday from 0-0pm and that means that I may miss band which I cannot. I don't see why someone who had five years of math in high school ()algebra in 0th which was a high school course offered for GT) has to take a stupid test. If I wasn't good in math I wouldn't have had five years of it and passed nor would I be an engineering major. Who knows. I called the department of mathematics and asked them about it. I tried to get a number so my teacher could call and try to see of something could be worked out and they were extremely rude to me. So I called the measurements and evaluations \center and they told me to call the department of mathematics. My teacher said " welcome to UT"  This is a wonderful idea to have a writing assignment of continual thought because I can just vent about the worst first day of class I have ever had in my entire life. I have strong feelings that it will get better because it cannot get worse. I know that the first semester is the hardest but right know I don't care. While I was studying,  I was thinking about the kids that went off to college and came back at Christmas and visited about their first semester at school. Everything they said doesn't' pertain to me. Nothing they said pertained to me. I thought about what I would say if I was ever asked to speak about my first semester at college. My Calculus teacher stressed \over and over how we need to take the AP test. He said that we would slack off because we already knew it. For me I need this semester review. I love math and work hard at it. It doesn't come easy to me but I love it and no matter how hard something is if you love it you will work your darndest at it to achieve the highest possible. So I was thinking about if my calculus teacher asked me to come to his class what I would say if someone asked me why I didn't the AP test and if it were a smart decision, ( that was my cat walking across the key board. )  He wants outside because he knows that there are other cats outside and he wants to attack them. He's a 00 week orange tabby cat named Bevo-talk about school spirit. I think that I would answer the AP question as one that it is a personal decision. My boyfriend AP out of 000C and said that was the worst thing he did. Some people are happy they did. Another guy from home AP out of 00 hours and went to M&A and came home because he failed everything but PE. My \philosophy is that I need to start from the beginning in order to get used to things. ,  So what if I have already gone over this in high school I don't care. Why make things hard on myself with new material my first semester it's not like I'm going to graduate in 0 years anyway. I figured that if I took my basic chemistry and calculus things I know that I could get used to teaching styles college life and testing style. I will have to study and I know this real well, but It won't be all new to me. Well I started at 00:00 and it's 00:00. ,  I do have one question though,  if we participate in more than five hours of experimental stuff for our semester requirement can we get extra credit for that extra hour(s)? That's all folks. Good-bye and Good luck. 
__label__label1 Naturally, since I am a college student, I should be focused on my college education, but my mind seems to be in other places right now. I went home over the summer and ended up meeting a wonderful person. That person and I became very close over the summer and ended up dating for a while. I am a guy and I never thought that I would be able to meet a guy that I could have such strong feelings for. We spent so much time together. I would go to work every morning at 0 am , and I would usually get out at about 0pm. After work, we would go running together. which served two purposes - exercise and spending time together. Well, the summer went by really fast and by the time I knew it, it was time for me to return to LOCNAME. It was really hard to say goodbye to him but eventually I had to do it. On my way up to LOCNAME, I stopped at his house and he had made me breakfast. We ate and talked for a while. I did not want to stay there too long or else I would end up arriving in LOCNAME too late. So I said goodbye. which was one of the hardest things I have had to do in a long while. besides tell my parents that I am gay. I don't think I am the same person after I met him. I have learned how to express my feelings more openly. I used to be so scared to express my feelings to anyone. probably because the people I used to date were girls. and deep down inside I was not happy with them. Now that I have experienced being with someone, and being happy with someone else. I want to feel like that all of the time, but the problem is that he is back home. and keeping a long distance relationship has been really hard. We decided to "break it off", and so he has been on my mind lately. which has contributed to my procrastination on this assignment. Anyway, this seems like a dumb thing to talk about. and I honestly can't believe I submitted this for an assignment. but it kind of helped to "write" it out. and hopefully I can get this out of my mind and focus on the more important aspects of my life right now. . 
__label__label0 okay well here goes nothin' I guess so whats the big deal about all this anyway all I was told was about how hard it ws going to be and so far its been a boat ride we used to play dominoes back in high school in my theatre class and I was the only white kid it was kind of fun actually they all taught me how to play "bones" a boat ride was when all the dots on the end dominoes added up two twenty boat ride and so on well its great so  far mom party party party class party party party sleep class party that's my schedule why does this girl keep taking us so seriously I'm so frustr. with her right now oh well sobeit and so on so how much tim e . damn fifteen minutes left what else would you,like to know sir. maam. it whatever is this here to entertain you or for you to. nevermind well here we are just me and you pizza sounds good Kilgore Trout I need to finish that book great book so much crap noone sees the genius and so on the severity of any problem is measured by the attainability of its solution-me yeah psych class 000 people huh and not a damn one is anyhting like me maybe one okay two or three but thas all jammed my finger it hurts to type falling down the stairs at my dads my party drunk 0 in the morningjammed my shoulder and finger price to pay for a good time huh? well answer me nevermind should I tell her what I'm thinking maybe not I ve got plenty of time plenty of time PROPNAME PROPNAME he used to sing PROPNAME PROPNAME no more I could not as good as real thing greatt album best of all time U0 crowding my space!!!! okay well are going to give it back for some reason I don't miss it at all I guess I'm hungry griffin liz maybe other girl one of these things is not like the other hot in here workstastion blah blah cuts handsneed new band for my wtch planner aol disk I tired band I wish theyd make it big like daisy I wish daisy'd make it bigger shopping no wait witherspoon. should I go to the concert or the game. the music or the sport that is the question LOCNAME. its all about the show but who know s what show will blow through a town that goes. never again will I write a poem short story etc. maybe a sports article when I'm old and grey and have no teeth and a dog named ralph with my wife having passed away thrre years earlier in my newly finished rocking chair that my grandchildren made for me and the cushion for my arthritic back. orthopedic shoes pipe in hand and caxcer in mouth calling ralph to my feet watching reruns of the X-files praying to God that one of my kids would call to hear a voice or that ralph could talk if that's his name cause wont remember a thing but that's okay because the one thing I will remember is PROPNAME PROPNAME and so on times up  
__label__label0 This is kind of difficult to do, because I am still in school mode, and it is hard to just right anything because I am trying to make it acceptable to a professor but I am doing my best to keep righting continuously for twenty minutes, I guess we supposed to just right what were thinking about right now, so I will tell you, I am kind of hungry and I wonder if the cafeteria is open downstairs because I am to cheap to go out and buy my own food, PROPNAME PROPNAME is kind of scary don't you think, the way his nose just kind of pokes out at you is really weird and sometimes I shudder when I see pictures of him, but I am working on getting over that right now and hopefully I will be able to watch the thriller video with out breaking down into a sobbing mess I wonder why my roommates keep the room so cold, it is like an icebox in here and my toes are always freezing, I have to go stand outside on my balcony to warm them up during the day, I wonder what I will do during the winter when I can't use the sun to warm my toes I guess I will just have to buy a footbath I am excited about the video music awards coming on tonight because they are always good for a few good laughs but I have to run now so I will see you kids later 
__label__label1 so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like S&M. I came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers I have had correspondence with since I recorded my CD. The fraternity parties weren't that great except for a Kappa Sigma one that was pretty wild. I pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. Not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. I am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in ORGNAME. I can't say it's all been bad though I did get a free T-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. Oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 00-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. I don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then I can continue to ramble. College is supposed to be the best years some say. I think I should of keep better stock in my highschool years. Now except for parties I live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language I don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. I'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. So I'll let you off till I have to write the next one. 
__label__label0 Right now I am feeling a sense that I have a lot of catching up to do in my reading. Not particularly for this subject but for some of my others. my classes thid semester consist of a lot of reading. For the most part I am enjoying school. I think that it will only get better as days go by and I begin to meet more and more people. I am from LOCNAME and hardly any of my friends came to UT. I guess that they all wanted to get away from home. I love LOCNAME and ORGNAME has a wonderful Interior Design program, it is in the school of Architecture. Right now I am in the Arch. library and my typing is kind of loud I hope that it is not bothering anyone. I am about to go to my next class it is an architecture  class with 000 students. Most of my classes except for one are with 000 students. (about 000)  College goes by so quickly I can't believe that it is already thursday. Where does the time go?  Since I am from LOCNAME I have learned that living in austin and attending school in austin are totally different. I am the only family member besides my grandmother who decided to come to LOCNAME. most of my family went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME, and ORGNAME. My sister just graduated college from colorado state in Ft. PROPNAME. I love LOCNAME. My older brother is going to grad school at Ut LOCNAME and working at the same time.  Over the Christmas holiday my sister and I are going to LOCNAME, PROPNAME, I can't wait. Well there is so much I could say right now but I am running out of time. Sorry for all of the mistakes. 
__label__label1 Right now I am kind of in pain. Someone feel backwards in their chair and fell on my leg and scraped it. It stings a little, but it will be okay. I've been trying to do the pre-testing, but it won't let me on. I'll try to do it later. I like the internet because it is great that I can look things up on it. It's cool that I can look at notes from my classes. It's a good thing, but yet I still hate it because I do not have a computer and my roomates is not working for some reason. It is really annoying because I have to leave my room to get on the internet. It is also a pain because I can never get on when I want to. Like the pre-testing that I just tried to do, why can I never get on?  Oh well, I guess I will have to try later. My roomate and I are really getting along great. The only thing that is a problem is that she goes to bed at 0:00 at night. I can't go to sleep that early. Last night I had homework and she did not. I felt so bad because I had lights on and was making noises. I feel bad, but if I have homework I can't worry about her. so far, I really like ORGNAME. My mom wanted me to be an Aggie, but I decided I would much rather be a Longhorn. My mom thinks this school is to bg for me. She thinks I have the personality of an Aggie, because I am so shy. My mom even offered to pay for a sorrority so I would make friends. My mom can't even afford this school. I think I have made a lot of friends though. I am shy, but it's not like I am mute. I am afraid that my mom is going to be really lonely now that I am gone. She is the only one in the house and does not go out with her friends much. My sister lives close by, but is to busy. She is the total opposit of me, she is a social butterfly. She is 00, but acts 00. I heard that you can use your meal plan money at the Jester store, I wonder if it's true. If it is that would be really cool. I could really go for some pizza right now. I should go to the store and get some frozen pizzas. That would be good for Sunday night when the cafeteria is closed. I think the Kinsolving cafeteria is better than Jester's. They have a great selection and the pizza is really good there. There is one guy that works there that is really nice. He is allways smiling. I think it's cool that they have ice cream there. I love ice cream sandwiches. They are really good. It was hard to decide if I wanted to live in Jester or Kinsolving. The rooms are much nicer at LOCNAME than at Jester. I love the big window. Jester has a tiny window and the walls are pale. Jester on the other hand has a great location. It is close to everything and everyone lives there. You allways run into people you know and it's easy to get a bunch of friends together for lunch and dinner. I feel bad because I got my roomate sick, and 0 of my friends. oops!  Well I have three minutes left. I wanted to go home this weekend, but I can't. I did'nt go last week because of the football game and my sister came to visit. I can't go home this weekend because my ride's car's air-conditioning broke. I know noone will take me home next weekend because of the football game. I wonder if I'll ever get to go back home!  Both of my parents are coming for parent's weekend. I wonder if they get to sit with me at the football game. I wish I had a computer, it would be so much easier. Well my time is up and I really have to go to the bathroom, so I guess I will go now. Bye!

__label__label0 As I sit here at my computer, I can't help but think about everything going on in my life right now. This year has been an incredible time in my life. My senior year in highschool, I was involved in many extracurricular activities. I was one of the head dance team captains, I was the Student Counsil spirit committee chairperson, and I was involved in Key club. I felt I had everything going for me. I had gotten into UT with my best friend. We couldn't believe both of us got in. I remember my best friend got in first and I didn't think I had gotten in. Every time I checked online it said I was still in review. A week later she calls me and says she has some good news. The first thing she said was,"so what color bed spread do you want to get. "  I knew right away what she was saying. I was so excited. After that there was no more pressure as to if I had gotten in or not. The pressure now was the fact that in a few months I was going to have to live on my own. It was weird because it would never hit me that I was really going to be in college. Even a week before I was going to leave I still couldn't tell myself I was leaving. The day I got up here was really hot and tiring. Moving stuff up and down the elevators from the parking garage to the dorm, then from the dorm up to my room. The halls were very hot and crowded. We had to wait in a line to even get into the elevator. Once I got all my stuff into my room I now had to unpack it all and organize it all. I remember feeling so disorganized. When I feel disorganized I begin to get upset. Well my parents were being very helpful and understanding. There was a point when I just wanted to cry. After an hour or two my parents left and it was just me and my best friend in our room. I had to move stuff around almost 0 times before I was happy, but even then I did not feel satisfied. Atleast right now I think I can say I am happy about my room. That is after a few shopping trips. This morning was the big football game against ORGNAME. We had tickets to go but it was just too hot. All I have to do though is look out my window and I can see the whole stadium full of screaming fans. I do have to say I have a wonderful view. While sitting here in my room after a week or two of classes gone by, I feel I am more comfortable. I feel a sense of pride, a sense of independance, and all in all I am now very happy. I have met many intersting people, I love all my classes, and most of all I love UT. The funny thing is that it has finally hit me that I am now in college. Being the oldest in the family made it a little harder leaving, but all my life I have been the one to do everything first. My parents are very proud of me and I can say that I am very proud of myself. 
__label__label1 well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games. I went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 00 minutes. until writing #0. 
__label__label0 There are mostly worries and fear traveling through my mind at the moment. The college stress has really kicked in now that classes have started and much work is to be done. The work is really bothering me in that the level of it is so high. There are many other factors in my stress including being away from home. In the whole 00 years of my life I have never been away from home without my family for this long amount of time. I guess I just miss all the little things about being at home-the comfort, luxery, friends, family, and not to exlude food!  I have eaten Chinese food most of my life and I can say that the dorm food I do not find to satisfying. And the life of college is so different from my previous school experience. ORGNAME is so big and so diverse that it's kind of difficult to adjust to. Some people are friendly whiles others may not be. Failure is also a concern for me. I have always done well in school and my parents have high expectations for me to succeed here in college. I miss all my friends and always think about the past and all the good times. I guess I must start all over here and make new friends and continue all the good times. After all, college is supposes to be the best time of one's life. I also think about what I will end up after college-where I'll work and who I will hang out with and if I will graduate here in LOCNAME. My past two weeks here in LOCNAME have been decent. I have been doing many different things like shooting pool or just hanging out with friends or going clubbin in 0th ST. Also I have been busy I might add. The people I have met are very similar to me personality wise. And most of them are from my home town of LOCNAME. I have noticed that there are many different groups of poeple here. I guess the homework load is as much as I expected before I started coollege but there are so many activites to attend to that I find it hard to complete all the work. That is when stress kicks in again and I end up just trying to rush through it. The class sizes are amazing larger than I expected them to be although I knew that ORGNAME is the largest school int he nation population wise. I fear that I will not perform as well in school due to all the distractions that goes on like friends wanting to go out and the many places to go to like 0th ST for example. I guess I will adjust to this environment eventually but when I will I am not sure. Rest has also been an issue in my mind as I have trouble sleeping at night when I have early classes the next morning. I am very tired the next day having to walk so much during each school day. But the next night I will find it hard to sleep again. I hope that ends very soon also.

__label__label0 As I start this essay I am feeling a little wary because I am doing it a little late. I am starting to think about what to write. I think that if I don't write something intellingent I will come off as dumb or ignorant as to what I am feeling. I am also thinking erotic thoughts. I am also feeling embarassed for writing that down. I am scared that after reading this you will think that I am a pervert (which I am not). I am once again thinking about what to write; once again thinking that if I don't write something smart I will come off as dumb. I am beginning to think of friends from back home. People I left behind, family, friends, teachers with whom I had pretty good relationships. I am now thinking of a conversation I had with two other friends on a very private issue. My father comes into my head also, times I have spent with him after he and my mother seperated. Then I think of times with my stepmother and how my mother would dislike it if she knew that I acknowledge her as someone related to me. I am now feeling a little anxious because I do not want my sister to come home right now and see that I wrote something about having erotic thoughts. I now am thinking of a girl in one of my classes. It isn't erotic, I am just thinking of what she looks like in the class and how I would like to talk to her sometime. Then I start to feel a little down because I haven't made any really close friends in college yet, just aquaintences. Again I am thinking about what to write. I just got an image of the capitol as it looks from the tower and I just thought about the tower. I think about going to Mezes hall to sign up for an experiment. I am now worrying again because I haven't signed up for one. 
__label__label1 well, today was ok in te beginning, I met lucy for our first class and we sat together we pretty much spent most of the day together I just didn't realize how easy it was to spend time with someone new. she is just someone who's easy to get a long with  but after walking around campus for a million years we came to jester to check out the learnsing skills center and there was so much stuff there to help us study and do homework for cal and chem. the lady there was so nice and helpful, the trip was really worthwhile. I tried to buy stamps from the vending machine, but it just wouldn't take my money. I had to go back and forth too many times. finally I bought some out of the other machine where I didn't get ot chose which stamps I wanted which kinda pissed me off. then we went to dobie to visit karen and christy. while we were there I had fun. but then my ankle started hurting a lot and I guess I just walked on it too much. we went to eckerds to get my pictures and a lot of them look good. I was kinda mad that the pictures of the flowers and such I took got messed up and I can't retake them. oh well. I was kinda scared walking all the way back to kinsolving because ppl could see my injured ankle and someone could've just come up and assaulted me. at the time, I was kinda hoping someone would cause there's just so much stuff here that's depressing. when I got home, I was about to cry cause I was thinking again about how no one comes over here to visit me. I mean, who are my real friends (that is if I have any) they're so lazy they can't even come over here to visit. no one really calls me either. I just don't know how to describe it cause I know if I REALLY wanted to talk to them I could just call, but well, no one really calls me. it's just frustrating cause while erin's out all these ppl always call and when she's over she's on the phone so much and she goes out every night. i know I don't need to go out and be on the phone all the time, it's just that it's really lonely not hving anyone over here all the time to keep me company. maybe if erin and I were more talkative or she was home more often. i don't know, it's just weird. what am I supposed to do about stanley? I mean, I actually would've gotten into a relationship with  him even though I know it'd just be physical, but sometimes that's what I need. the touch of someone who cares. but I guess stanley doesn't really care. he just was thinking of himself and how he needed to satisfy his urges. it's not fair! it's not fiar at all that I have to be here alone when I see so many ppl on the outside who have b/f and g/f and they don't really look like they deserve them. I don't know where to go f/ here cause I feel so lonely a lot and no one can really understand how I feel. crying right now. i don't even feel as though god understands or can hear how troubled I am. i just wish that there was someone who REALLY cared, someone who'd ALWAYS be here for me. but it's like I can't REALLY count on anyone. everyone has their own life. and it's always about them. i don't like being alone. if I just killed myself, I could end all this, but I don't want to. but I do. i need to find out what the future will be like. even if I never find someone who appreciates me, if I can just somehow find some happiness. just a little. go one day where I don't cry or think about being lonely. just a little something. it's not fair. what do I do? it's hard to go on each day trying to endure the battles that come with  each day. trying to face the hardships. if only I could do what I really wanted to do. scrapbooks and drawing and painting have money to do what I wanted to. build my dream house. design it, oversee the construction. one day. that's my dream. to have a wonderful house to live in. where I can go to find myself at peace. a weight room, sauna, spa, pool, greehouse, huge living room with  a giant entertainment center, huge bedroom and bath, huge windows. a painting art room, dojo, so many things I want to do. but I don't know if that will bring me happiness. how am I supposed to be happy if I can't share the big house with  someone I love. someone who loves me back. loves me as much as I love them. it's hard to think of what love is when I think that I've been there, and not been able to feel the same f/ the other person. what am I doing here anyway?? there's nothing for me now. i'm so alone. alone in this room with  no one calling me, asking me to do anything. what kind of friends do I have? no one is as considerate as me or maybe as sensitive as me. i just don't like being alone. if someone wanted to ask me out, in desperation. like donald said, being in love with  the thought of being in love. maybe that's what I've been in with  anthony. but I really thought he was the one. the one I could spend my life with . will I ever be able to fine someone to end my loneliness? 
__label__label0 well I don't know what to say but I think I should start by sayin I'm really beginning to appreaciate the little things of life. I always have but learning about the body is facinating. the brain especially. there have been times when I feel things and wonder, but I'm now getting some answers due to this book. the class we havnt learned much but the book I've gone ahead. i think about all kinds a things. mostly music and social justice. besides psyc, I got bio which is boring so far but I know I like it . my other classes r mexican american study classes which are all intertwing, or overlap. i think college is coo so far, but for other people I'm sure its harder for others. u se e I've always pretty much been alone, besides my mom. my parents divrced when I was 0, and ever since then my father figures have been in a almost constant shuffle. from my stepdad, to my uncle, to a rapper that I consider my biggest influence, and the last 00 years later my dad. i feel alota anger deep down but have always been able to control it. most of the  time but we all have outlashes I guess. now I am just starting to reach a stable state,,I'm here finally,,no more anticipation,,I'm off weed and drinking,,but the main issues are always family and my lady. shes still in san jose, ca where I'm from. i don't know if I should be faithful or what but I think so. weve talked about a lot a things in our year together and I've taen a lot a shit out onher. i miss every0 a lot but I'm a strong person that can overcome it. always have. adversity is a part of my life that I take in stride. u have too. i see all these others here adapting and hardly any look happy,,they look all fake but maybe its just cuzz I'm on the outside just the way I like it. i'm a chicano here and it seems 00% are all white and 0% asian, 0% black , and 0% other. i also don't like it cuzz I havent really been far from campus cause no car and its to hot to take the bus. I love the bus cause I get to see all the poor people that I love associating wiht. the other homeboys and girls in the struggle or the older mexicans. u can learn a lot from talking to strangers or just observing. thats what I've always done at home and I look forward to doing it here. thats y I came here instead of miami,,cause theres mexicans here. i got a lota pride and love for my people. thats y sometimes my relationship tears me apart. my lady is white. i don't know how it happened,,we started as nothing and ended up being perfect. but llike everyhting I think theres a reason and I know if its meant to be I can work through it. i liked the part of the text that talked about anger and the balence of hapiness we all achieve,,,money doesn't make any0 better. in y opinion its almost like it makes potentially good people worse. but theres always exceptions. power is the other main curropter. or do people currupt power,,,who knows. i've always known that sensations were the vary things to guide ur life. they come from somewhere and I couldnt say where. i think god. gods everywhere. i don't go to church but in my heart I'm going the right direction, doing the right things. thats y u feel what u feel. ur direction and what u want to become. people don't realize that. and sometimes unfortuanatly people are very impressionable. especially in our society, putting aside color, gender, socioeconomic, everything,,,theres very few people that fight through it. i know iam 0 but I also know its harder to stay on top than just getting ther . i look forward to proving that I belong here 
__label__label0 0:00. 00 minutes. time?   Why did I wait so loong to do this? Well I didnt know about it until Thursday, but still, what happened Friday?  Oh yeah, I slept I think or maybe not it seems so far away. I guess its worth waiting since I got to see PROPNAME. God I sometimes feel like we are in competition and I keep reminding myself that  it can't be like that. Of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. I wonder why I have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since I've been here. PROPNAME I can kind of see because she is older and attractive but I would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. Maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. God I need to loose weight. Why did she think I didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell I had?  Maybe she feels threatened like I do. I bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. I kind of want to skip the greek festivle because I am afraid. I'm afraid of being the odd one out. Ok obviously I willl be like the only non greek. PROPNAME,. how I wish I was greek or smatter sometimes. I miss feeling loved. I miss feeling strong and powerful. Although I do feel that way here sometimes. LOCNAME just isn't right for my balance I think. Then again this is an emotional time of the month. But no I have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. I gues sits good to face, but at the same time I just want to crawl back home to paris. Will I always think of it as home I wonder. God, sometimes the future is hopless. Dear god, why do I sometimes feel this desperate?   I know there are a lot of things I have done wrong, but I also know that I have been forgiven. Lord, I love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which I can get to a church so that I can get the spiritual nourishment I need. I am starting to feel drained/. My father, jesus christ, please help me to help PROPNAME. Help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. Lord I pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. Christ PROPNAME please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. After vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. Please help remind me not to give  up, that mistakes are just that  nad that I neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. Lord Jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because I know I don't have it. Please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. Help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. Lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. Lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. Lord I pray for jUles. my heart is breaking for him because I love him so much. The thought of him tears me apart Lord. I know that everything happens for a reason and that I am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. Lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when I see it and to embrace it willingly as I believe I do now. Lord please continue to work in the life of PROPNAME. Help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. Help him to understand how I know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that I am able to experience any time. Give him peace lord   jesus from whatever may torture his mind. Help PROPNAME and PROPNAME to find the same things too. To be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time?  00:00. 
__label__label1 I sit staring at the blue syllabus from the class in front of me. What do  I write about? The sad part is that it seems like such a miniscule task. Write about what I'm thinking about. So now I ponder what I normally think about? What do I normally think about, but I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm thinking about right now. I'm thinking I should turn of the television behind me, yet I'm so attracted to this rerun that I have watched so many times. Although since I am writing this, I am not exactly paying attention to what is going on on the television. I can hear the faint noice in the background. Why can't I concentrate? I always have this problem. I feel that my attention span has shortened as I have gotten older. I have problems watching a thirty minute television program! How can I sit here for twenty minutes on task? Especially since I have a million things to do. Such as a paper in my Literature and the Law class. But I am not able to sit for a long time and simply work on that paper. How did I ever get into college? Sure my grades were somewhat decent, yet I always tend to work to the point of exhaustion, mainly because I procrastinate. When I procastinate I do all at once. since my attention span is so short, and I am not able to sit and continuously put forth a vast amount of effort my work comes out poorly. This must be why I have only decent grades. I must put forth more of an effort. Life can be extremely challenging especially since I am not able to do such a miniscule task of prioritizing. But why am I complaining about my grades? College has just begun! I can turn around and begin new! But I say this every time and it never happens. Sure you can change anything, but come on, am I actually gonig to do that? NO! I'm just pathetic in that way. Its like all the people I know who have broken promises. Sure everyone says they'll do this or that,but do they? I am always upset when people break promises because I never break promises to other people except to myself! I can stop being a procastinator, but do I? I can start exercising more, but do I? The most important person in my life,me , is the one person who I put last. Who cares how I look to others as long as I feel good inside. Do I feel good inside? Hard question. Do I have an answer? I don't know. I'm constantly criticizing myself. Come on sonia, you can be better at this or that. But do I make a point of actually becoming better no! I suppose all people are like this, they attempt to be someone their not. I have to just face the fact that I am who I am and if I really want to change I have the chance but I don't have to change! 
__label__label1 I have no idea where to start on this thing, and I forgot to look at the clock 0:00, okay, I feel better now. This has got to be the longest version of LOCNAME LOCNAME ever, it takes them about 0 years to start singing. I need to go to the grocery store, need to get some milk and hot dogs. the essentials. Could probably just run to the 0-00, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion. Should just by a new one, but don't know where I'd put this one in this tiny room. Dorms suck. Living it up at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man, my typing skills have gone downhill, it's sad. I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 00 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 00. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised PROPNAME hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love PROPNAME PROPNAME. this song brings back memories of 0th, no 0th grade. I think I liked 0th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s. I should really go find PROPNAME and reminesce. Don't think that's spelled right, whatever. Haven't talk to PROPNAME in awhile, she's probably off trying to be the next PROPNAME foster. psycho. Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy. PROPNAME will probably be back in my spot. That would suck. My foot's asleep, three minutes to go. The computer better not crash now. I really should clean this room up, that's probably on the list of things to do. I wonder what song is next. Oh, that's the end, good my time is up. 0:00, yeah. 
__label__label0 Well, I suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did I wait this long to get assignments like this done. I always put a lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off. I haven't been doing in college so far, but I know if I was more productive with my time I'd be better off. That and money. I haven't been very good with money lately. Oh, I have plenty to live on, but I spend a LOT of money on things I simply don't need. I also tend to spend money unwisely, like buying things somewhere when I KNOW I can get them somewhere else much cheaper, but I buy it anyways because it's there and convenient. I don't have any income right now eithher, I need a work-study job, but that shouldn't be too hard. I've already paid my rent for the semester, and so a job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine. I've got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people, too. The unfortunate thing is, it's getting to a point where it's almost a home-run business, and I'm beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue. I hate filling out forms, much less loads of tax forms. I'm only 00, and it's a thing I do on the side to make extra money, and I don't know if I should be concerned with such a thing as business tax forms and accounting. I've only done three small commerical webpages . . I don't know if that excuses me from anything. I need to talk to some expert about that. Money is no object to me, in the end, though. That's probably why I'm so careless about most of it. I have been keeping a pretty tight track of it, though, just to make sure I don't go broke. I'm looking at buying a computer, and I think I have just enough. My work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses. I also spend a good bit on music, which is something I'm really into. Not music in general, mind you, but just the stuff I listen too. A lot of it is fairly obscure . . I'm not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure. I listen to a good bit of forgotten artist's stuff, like albums they release after they've had their heydey - which is usually in the 00s. I listen to music basically all the time. My roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time, sometimes I wonder if he minds, but I don't think he does. We have a guitar in our room, and it's my roommate's. He doesn't play it too often, only a bit now and then. He's decent. I don't know anything, though. I'm not muscially inclined, personally, in any way. I don't sing or play any insturments, though I wish I did. Something like keyboards or drums would be cool, but I've been learning to apprecaite the guitar more. I like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make. PROPNAME PROPNAME, when he was a guitarist for Genesis way back when, is a great example. I heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized, and as a result, he played some interesting solos. He made the band sound a little more Floyd-ish I guess. Still, that's the kind of guitar I'd like to learn to play. Acoustic riffs would be neat to learn, too. The keyboards would be tough, but I'd think the most fun to play could be the drums. Drummers have a lot of different styles, I've noticed. I wouldn't leanr to play really fast and make a lot of noise, I would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesn't take just speed, but lots of skill, too. I don't know how most bands play it now a days, but drums don't always particularly stand out in some songs now a days, but I guess a lot of them don't hold that as important. When PROPNAME PROPNAME was drummer for Genesis, the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out. Not because they were loud, neccessarily, but because they were different with what you usually heard. They didn't go along with the song, they would almost LEAD the song. Really, though, all of the members of the band Genesis make it such a great band, which if you haven't caught on by now, is my favorite band. I'm getting a little tired and I have lot more reading and some homework to do. Tomorrow is Monday and classes start up again. Fun. 
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems long, I wonder what the footbal game will be like. I miss my best friend. I'm glad to be going home next weekend. My own bed. It is lonely when no one is around me. WOnder what my roomate is doing? Why is my floor so quiet right now? I'm glad I don't want to be around anyone right now. I hope clubbing is fun tonight because I do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in Jester. WOnder if I'll transfer next year? I hope I get into the busines school, but at the same time if I don't I have an excuse to leave LOCNAME. I miss LOCNAME. Autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in LOCNAME? I hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. I just want to be back in my comfortable bed in LOCNAME not in LOCNAME texas. I know I must be upset because I could barely eat at lunch. Why has no one called me today? I call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. Oh, this is my favorite part of this song. I am gald I decided to put on PROPNAME PROPNAME while I did this. I wonder if my cats miss me? I bet they miss onnecticut too. I hope I meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. I hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because I suck and I don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. I am praying that I don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. I do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but I like to know a guys name, maybe his major. Now I am getting too worried about the thing maybe I should stay at home. No, I will not do this to myself again, I can't this is completely ridiculous. Just because I don't know these people too well doesn't mean that I can hide from the world. how am I going to get know these people better if I don't go and do these things. ORGNAME was fun last night and I tought it wouldn't be. I am glad I got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. I think that I am loosing weight, I should be because I have been eationg a lot less since I have been here. No snacking for me!!! Plus I walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 00. But I could do with out the heat. That seems like a little too much for me. It never was that hot in LOCNAME. Okay, maybe, but I just miss it up there. All my friends, even though they are at college. I wish it was senior year again. Everything was so much less complicated then. Now I feel as though I will never have everything that I did there. I tried to appreciate it all when I had it, but I didn't appreciate it enough. I had so much and even though I still have the memories I miss it all so much. I know it won't be the same when I go back, but I miss the security that I felt there. I know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but I do not want to have all this growth I happy with myself and what I was and don't want to change. Maybe if I am lucky I'll be able to graduate in three years. I already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. I miss Mrs. PROPNAME and even Dr. PROPNAME. Why can't I just adjust and love everything? well I guess I just have to keep on doing what I am doing and that is that. all I know is that I will never forget what I left behind. 
__label__label0 this tyoe of thing bothers me because it seems really impossible to typ eexamap wow that was swpelled bad I mean t exactly what I am thinking . mab thisis really hard for me because I kkep wanteing to go back andn fix allt he crap errors I am making, I never realized how bad I was at typing ok that is better I guess I just need to get in the wrythim or nto to get the typing thing right. well I don't knw I have done this before in my spare time but somthinges was that suppoes to say somethings because I think I meant somethines  man that is weird I can't type it I somethings no I want to type sometimes ok then,  this mamkes no sense myabe my mindis just ompletely twisted and illogical. I doub t it though because it sut nevermind that word I  often think abou t things so logivally that it scares me. proving yourself wrong is knida werid because you almost regret it sometimnes. an interseting thought that keeps coming to me, I will have to ask the prof this: if one is beign tried for  a murder, and to get "away" withit he pretends to be insane, and the trial lasts like a real long time like a year or two, and this whole time he has to pretend he is really off the wall completely insane, would he after a while actually in reality become insane, but because he is really insane not realize it and still insist he is completely sane in his own mind, I somehow htinki  that he could really go insane and not realize it, I guess itsa ll perception thought, I mean who perceives what, I perceive mysefl to be sane, but maybe on another standard I am insane, who is to say what is really right?  Well I think ultimately there is a standerad or fgith and wrong it is just ath people who are wrong can't really be proved that they are wrong because we deal with perception. like basicaly I belve in GOd, and what he says andhis standards are absolute truths, but since those of us who believe it are human, we can only relay it as our perception see, and those who have a different perception may be wrong, but cannot be prved wrong because each argument is a perception. basically that is what faith is there for, some fcould argue that faith is actually a device made up by the human mind to justify a perception, but then you could argue that this arguement is actually a perception devised to justify a different percepton. I really didnt find blari witch scary, I mean, it really was a little freaky, but not hjold my breath to stop from screaming scary. whats wrierd is I have started thinking outside whati am typing and I keep thinking how I am faliing at truly represeintinng my thoghts. can yoiu belvie I am actually tryin to think of a creatvie way to end this?  How do yo end sterama of conciousness anyway??????????? in reality you can't can you, I just have to force my hands of the keyboard. 
__label__label1 Ever since I came to LOCNAME about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in LOCNAME. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. 
__label__label0 Right now I am very tired, and I really don't know why. I got enough sleep yesterday, but then again I had a very busy day yesterday. It must have been when I went to try out for the texas crew team. I am not sure whether I should join, and it has been bugging me all day. If I join, I will have to sacrifice many things. First off, I would have to get up really early in the morning and I am not use to that. Second, time would be another sacrifice. I would have less time to do other things,  and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. I am really missing the girl that I left back home in order to come attend the university. She was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. We got along great, hardly ever fighting. I miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. Her parents were really good to me also. This girl was going through a really hard time in her life when I met her. I am greatful that I was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. That time was when her parents were getting divorced. She got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. This upset her a great deal. I enjoyed the fact that I could be there for her when she needed me. As a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. Her stepsister is really making her life tough. For that, I resent her stepsister. She disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. This girl is named PROPNAME. Emily really pisses me off a great deal. Why does she have to be that way. Nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. I think about my girl quite often, but I know that I am up here for the reason of getting an education. I don't know whether I should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when I am home. But while I am in LOCNAME, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. It seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. At first I was bit scared, but I know I can come out on top if I put the work and time in. It is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. But it can be done. I am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at LOCNAME. I plan to do the best that I can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing I will make it through alright. Wow, it has already been twenty minutes and I've got to make a class. 
__label__label0 I am sitting here on my bed in my dorm room. It is 00:00 at night  on a  wednesday. My friend is sitting here with me and we are about to watch the movie  Go. We just came back from brians room where we watched Pulp Fiction. My foot  kinda itches. I feel like I ate too much today. I am mad at myself because I  smoked two cigarettes today and I don't usually smoke unless I drink alcohol,  but it was fun anyway. I really hate to read and study, I would so rather go  out and party or even just hang out with people. I kinda feel like I get behind  because I am a slow reader and I can't comprhend all of the information in one  sitting. I keep losing concentration. I really want a rug in my room. I just  boiled some water to make coffee for suzanne and I . I am really gald I don't  do drugs or deal them. I kinda have a headache. I am really stressed out right  now about getting all of my work done. I need to find two monologues by friday,  type them up and read the plays they come from. I really want to be a good  successful actress when I graduate from collge and move back to LOCNAME I know it  doesn't look like I wrote a lot but I am just ti 
__label__label1 I keep thinking about the future and how my life will alter during and after college. I wonder how my grades will be after the first term. I hope I can make my parents proud. I don't want my parents to view me as a failure and a screw up I want them to be proud. I want to be accepted by everyone I meet. I want to succed in life. I wonder how my math test will be tomorrow. I just wish that society didn't view people on how much money they make I wish I could go to a place where everyone was the same and there was nothing to worry about maybe the place I'm thinking about is eternal utopia or heaven. I wonder if there is a heaven what happens after death where do we go. do we ever see the "creator" what is the creator is it god or did we evolve through evolution of mico o

__label__label0 This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 0 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the "freshman 00" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have PROPNAME because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of PROPNAME this weekend 
__label__label0 Now I am doing the stream of consious assignment for psy. class. It's wierd because I usually don't think this way, boy I am glad that PROPNAME PROPNAME is one of my good friends, I mean I thought there was no way that we would ever keep up after highschool, but right now we talk everyday I am sitting here at my desk wondering if Mer will call I really had a wonderful time with her on Mon I have thought of her kissing my ear several times sense she did it when we were in the man I wish my sweetmates would pipe down how often is it that when you break up you spend more time with the girl you broke up with than before crazy huh. Well I wish that I could see mer right now she would be so nice to hug and hold close and feel her tightly pressed against me and then I would feel back in highschool I think that bucs is going to be a good fraternity for me to join zube seems to be a great leader I think that he really has a great heart or the lord it's been 00 min so I hope that I am getting close to the timelimit I tried to due the dang survey but my computer locked up towards the end so it didn't count any of the work that I did which completely blows  I am really secretly attracted to shannon across my hall she has the most carefree attitude its so infectious I can't help but be relaxed when around her plus she is hot today matt said that he knew that she wanted me so I thought that was pretty cool I wish that when I went to my mailbox there would be something from someone I am tight with everytime I love my mom I know that most guys my age have a pretty bad relationship with their parents so it's diffinitely strange to be as close to mine as I am I love the fact that my parents are starting to trust me and give me space I love this song on the cd inx is the best I just wish that he wouldn't have killed himself to try and show that he was a talented musician I will never understand those that feel they have to kill themselves to get respect I really can't believe that I am having trouble in calc class when I have already had the class that's crazy I saw sarah today which was cool because I gave her a really big scare 
__label__label1 Why do I have this pimple? Why does it matter what people look like so much? I am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. I am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their "body", because their new "body" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. I went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. My best friend and I had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. He has a girlfriend, and I just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. It was HORRIBLE. It was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially "accepted" you had to have a beer in  your hand. Now, one might think that would be an excuse, but I didn't see, but 00 out of at least 000+++++ without a beer. For some reason, I want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. Thanks. :o) Well, it was so dumb. My best friend and I walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and I'm not all about that. I am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. It doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. I am more a people person. I like to make people laugh. I don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way I am. I have this quirkiness (thanks PROPNAME) about me, but I love it. I don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because I am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when I had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. My whole life, I have been nice, and I go by the saying "ORGNAME guys finish last". I had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is "nope". I was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. Okay, I know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. Two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying "PROPNAME, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying "oh, he is ugly" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave "See  you around", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 00,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 00 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare. I promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, I would get those stares. Thank you for your time. 
__label__label1 Being at cllege is a new experience for me and I think that it is giving me  a sence of being dependant on myself. I like all the new freedom that I have  gotten, but I also am homesick a lot. I miss my parents and being in my house  in LOCNAME. There isn't anyone to make sure that I do everything that I am  supposed to do. I am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that       I am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, I am  getting worried and that is gettting me scared. I have a lot of thing s that I  need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. It makes me very  frustrated and annoyed at the same time. I feel like I should be a lot more  organized and up to date with everything. I am a very organized person, even a  "neat feak," and that is why it's driving me crazy when I am behind. I think  that if I work hard, then I will do alright.       Last weekend, I went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so  good to be home. I was able to go driving around and I knew where everything   was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that I just need  time to settle into ORGNAME, and then I will be in more control. Austin is never  going to be "home" for me, but it will be a place that I can come to enjoy. I  don't think that any city can compare to LOCNAME because that is where I grew up  and that's also where I have all of my family and friends.       Sometimes I think about how life would be like if I was adopted or even if  one or both of my parents were dead. I look back and don't think that I could  manage. My parents play a very important role in my life and I don't think that  I would be the same person that I am without them. I know a lot of people that  have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough  times and they are doing well now, and I give them so much strenght and poer for  being able to do that. If my mother would pass on, I think that I would really  go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that I  would become very quiet when usually I am very outgoing and lively. Many things  don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. I usually  don't cry in movies, and I don't care to become very emotional all the time. I  have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. No matter  how depressing the news, I am unable to show my emotions. That is something  that I think that I get from my parents, specifically my mother. I think that I  have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical  qualities from my father. I think that I am able to be the person that I am  because of my parents. They helped shape me into the person that I am.       There are friends that I have been close to in high school, and ever since  I have come to UT, I have not been as close to. I don't know the reason for the  change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have  not tried as hard to keep in touch. I have heard that things like this happen  and that you make all of your really good friends in college. I know what  people say, but I have a really good friend at ORGNAME and me and her have keep  in touch really well. I think that she is an exception to the "rule. "                               
__label__label1 why am I so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in my life, I have no clue. Its probably becasue I'm a freshman or is it because I just don't know what I'm am doing in this school, it's too hard. I don't know how to work the computer system, I have tons of homework, and its all catching up to me at the same time, it's unreal. I'm so bogged down with work and I have so much stuff to do but I'm sitting here typing on my computer on something that I don't know will even get sent to you. My friends are talking to me while I'm trying to write this assignment, and I can't' make my mind focus on on certain thing at all, the music is too loud and I have people trying to talk to me over the internet. these blinking lights are pissing me off I wish these people would shut up and let me tend to my business at hand. I need to read, do my pre cal and I just don't have the time. I don't know how to do my physical science lab, and reading just takes too muck time. I have a date tonight,  I don't have time to take them out, but I have to or that wouldn't be nice, I'm going through rush and that takes up more time than anything. I can't' deal with this anymore. I'ts starting to drive me crazy , but hopefully soon I will get used to it. Its such a change from senior year to freshman year of college. you go from doing nothing basically to have to read every night and do all sorts of written assignment, it's impossible twenty minutes is up got to run

Sailor Soldiers theme plays. i hope I'll still have time around here to write my fanfics and my original piece. writing may be just a hobby, or so PROPNAME says, but I'm devoted to  it just the same, and I will keep writing, no matter what; like TV, it helps keep me sane in what seems like an insane world. all these kids and what-used-to-be-kids-a-few-weeks-ago, drinking, screwing around, partying their butts off, struggling through classes, spending all their free time studying; God!!! How can humans live like this?!!? I must write, I must watch television, I must keep my imagination going - I must keep creating my own worlds and immersing myself in them as much as possible while still functioning normally in the outside world. why write fiction, someone once asked? Someone quite succinctly answered, "Because reality bites!" I want to be like these people, and yet I do not; but then again, that's the way it is with me, always, isn't it? Human, yet inhuman, helper of men and destroyer of nations, this and that. i am always the great exception, one way or another. Mortal and immortal, good and evil, all abstract opposites do I embrace, and yet none can claim me fully. scientist, warrior, bard, clumsy, ugly oaf. i am what I am. What am I? I am PROPNAME. i have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME. a million assumed names over what feels like 00 lifetimes (but it's not; I know very well I'm just as mortal and human as the next guy - it's just that sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I guess you have these kind of odd thoughts when you have a world-generating imagination like mine. when you have pride like mine. arrogance like mine. insane and freaky judgment like mine. "I am a god! I am a god!! Damn you all who say it is not so!!!" goes a line from a book I've read. my roommate is on the phone again. talking with all of his friends who always call here, while  no one really ever calls me except for Mom, who just calls to nag. not that I mind the solitude, it's just that taking messages and answering phones for someone else and not getting paid $00. 00 an hour for it can get really annoying really fast. He's talking about a friend who lives in a private dorm - I wish I lived in a private dorm. I don't think I'll ever be really happy unless I can have my own house - not a big house, mind you, just one about the size of the one I grew up in. Just my own little castle in suburbia with my own bathroom, my own bedroom, my own closet, my own kitchen, my own TV, my own stereo; a place where I don't have to share and I don't have to worry about what anyone else wants - hell, I want a place where I can go (and stay) and have no problems. No worrying about where my paycheck and financial aid are, where the closest bank is around here, what time I have to be at class, what assignments I have to do. I want to be able to sit around all day and do nothing if I so choose, and have no ill consequences come out of it whatsoever. Yeah, that's a world I'd love - a world with no problems and no ill consequences from anything done. Hmph, how funny - I've just described Sailor Moon's Crystal LOCNAME of the 00th century. I want utopia. not a bad wish, when you really think about it, except that when I wished for it, I just wanted it for myself. I've noticed myself become more selfish and arrogant this past year- I wonder how that came out? Ah, well, forget about how - research that when you're in med school or have to write your next psych paper. For now, just condition yourself (whatever name you choose to use this time around) to be a good person, do your best, and keep writing about worlds where the good guys always win, problems can always be solved, and no matter how tragic things get, you can always have a happy ending. "Oh, what a beautiful dream; if it could only come true, you know, you knowith  what we need is a great big melting pot* Okay, strike that; hate that song. Okay, it's been 00 minutes, so let's send this in and hope the Prof. doesn't think you're too crazy. In case you have doubts, Dr. PROPNAME, I'm not; at least, not to the untrained eye. okay, shut up- you're not helping your image. Just wrap this up, okay? WRAP THIS UP! All right, go!  
__label__label0 Hi, when I think of this type of writing I think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and I thought it was very strange. right now I am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. PROPNAME PROPNAME is kind of cute and PROPNAME PROPNAME is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. My boyfriend plays football for St. marks. I love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. My friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but I can't imagine not talking to him. Last night at the Pike BBQ thing, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME played and that was cool, except that I had cramps and felt bad and PROPNAME had not called so I was mifted. I knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but I still wanted to hear from him, I am not sure that I am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. I fell like I am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so I don't know what to put. I am so tired right now. I went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (I told her to make me go)  The pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. I had issues with that; I don't think I was as openminded as I could have been because I was tired and hungry and grumpy and I had not talked to WEs this morning. My roommates phone is ringing,  I like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying,  We are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than I do. That's okay. I am not that big of a party girl and I think that my friends think I am a party pooper. Oh well, I did not party hard in high school so why start now. I know how to have fun, but I came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend PROPNAME went to ORGNAME and she has not called me or talked to me yet. I like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to I think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht PROPNAME. I am tired adn bored oh well  There are some very ood commercials on the television. I know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but I am a perfectionist. That is a major character flaw I am not that bad any more, however I am editing this little paper as I go,  I mean that I am just correcting my spelling, I wish that I knew how to type really fast,  liek super fast. wes thinks that I am Super Fine like the sugar I bought to put in my tea. Wow dallas is getting their butts kicked I normally would cuss a little in describing the cowboys, but I don;t knonw if that is appropriate for this assignment, I guess it does not matter one damn bit because it is not like anyone will read this. Anyway, Our pledge retreat was fun, okay this tyoing thing sucks. I have no idea what I am thinking. that is what I am thinking I get to go home and see wes's football game against PROPNAME. I hope that they win. okay why the hell has he not called me yet. this is very frustrating I know that he is busy but I would like to hear from him YEA only one more minute. kick ass. I love that phrase It is fun to say. My roommates phone keeps beebing and it is driving me crazy, well not really  but that was just something to type. okay time is up bu-bye  I like that way of saying bye,  The red skins just scored,  okay really bu-bye this time. 
__label__label1 I don't know how to put my thoughts into words. my mind wonders all the time. I'm really tired. the dog is taking a nap -- I wish I was taking a nap, too. I stayed up too late last night. church was hot and not very interesting. I wonder what time we're leaving today. the houston comets are playing very good. I guess they are still mourning the loss of PROPNAME PROPNAME. her death was so sad. where did that crazy dog go now. I bet she went to take a nap in my bed. my typing probably distrubed her. crap! the comets can't score to save their life. good shot. who the heck is that girl. PROPNAME PROPNAME is incredibly fast. I wonder why she doesn't get a long with cynthia cooper. pass the ball. rebound. is that a play or what. my sister is being such a baby today. she is so bossy, and when she doesn't get her way, she throws a fit. I never stick up for my brother, but the one time I do, it infuriates her. I can't wait to get back to austin, and I'll stay on my side of town, and she can stay on her side. I won't call her for a couple of days, so she can get completely over her temper tantrum. I hope eryn doesn't call me for a few days. I just want to stay at my dorm and relax and study by myself. this is the stupidest commercial. I hate that PROPNAME PROPNAME character. I have to go to the bathroom, but I still have 00 minutes to type. I have got to go on a diet. I'm getting extremely fat. I wonder when that aerobics program gets started. I hope it won't be too hard. I have got to set the vcr to tape my soaps for the week. I hate missing those shows. that girl is such a weiner. she is always getting hurt. I'm getting sick of typing. oh that was a cheap foul. I wonder how they wash there hair when it's in those braids. I bet it stinks. that girl is ugly. he is a horrible dresser. I wonder how much money they make. my watch is rubbing my hand. my eyes are tired. I haven't seen this commercial before. it's kind of dumb. my mind is starting to take a nap. it isn't wondering so much anymore. I hate that when I get in a daze and just stare at people. it's embarrassing. this game is getting boring, I wonder if there are any other games on. when do the cowboys play today. how much more room do I have. I guess I get as much room as I want. cynthia cooper is cocky. why do they wear lipstick when they play. that is retarded. they dress up to get sweaty and work out. I wonder how loud it is in that arena. my head itches. I think someone is driving up to my house. that's a walk! the comets are looking better. is it supposed to rain today. it's pretty cloudy out there. my throat hurts. I wonder if I'm getting sick. man I'm tired. can I ever run out of water in my eyes. every time I yawn my eyes fill completely, and --- the phone is ringing --- I looked at the caller id, but I don't want to talk to that person. I still have to go to the bathroom. well it's been 00 minutes, so I'm going to quit. I hope I did this right.      
__label__label0 Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in PROPNAME, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  
__label__label0 Right now I am tired, sleepy, and restless. Stressed about finishing work and school. I have a lot of work to get done before going to school. I want to get off to a good start this year and not fall behind. I need to finish this assingnment and get to others before school starts. I'm hungry and I need to make some food along with other things I need to do. I think I'll make a sandwich. I also need to take a shower before I go. I need to get my clothes out of the dryer so I have something to wear. I think I'll wear shorts today. I'll also wear a baseball cap. I want to pickup a cd on my way back from school today. Also need some groceries. I hope I don't have much homework tonight. Only a few more days until the weekend. I'm going to LOCNAME this weekend, that will be fun. This is a three-day weekend. I'm looking forward to having three days off. I'll probably hang out with friends and go to a movie this weekend. Oh, yeah, PROPNAME is back in town this week. I'll probably hang out with him this Friday, cause Saturday morning I have to go out of town. What is today?  Tuesday. That means I only have two classes today. That's pretty good, but the next two days are pretty long days, and then Friday is another short day. My 00 minutes is  almost up. I'm glad I got this writing assignment done and out of the way. Well, I guess that's it.  
__label__label1 right now my mind says why the hell do I have to do this. I'm not up to doing this crap because I just woke up and I realized that I have to get this homework done before it is due in class. I have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl I love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and I don't appreciate that. anyway I have realized that I have been slacking off in my classes and I have to get started on doing all of my homework because if I don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and I am going to be here all alone. I think that at he is stupid for what he did and I hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to  drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose,  then I will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is  all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, I am also thinking about this girl named felicia that I met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that I have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. I don't think that she thinks much about me but I sure do  hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy I am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food  at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is  not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so I we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out. 
__label__label1 I feel stressed as there is not enough time for anything. Will this ever slow down. Always things, always processes. I am glad school has started again, yet  I am worried how everything will turn out. I am angry with my step mother. A death in the family has made me depressed, and happy at the same time because I know that she is no longer hurting and is in a happier place. I am frustrated with growing out my hair. My dads and my relationship has grown since our talk last week. I am dissapointed in the way I acted a couple of days ago. I hope my dads and my relationship continues to grow and build. I am ready for the heat to go away it is miserable out side. I feel dissapointed in myselfif I don't work out daily, and I probably shouldnt. I love my new apartment, but sometimes I feel lonely. I think I will like all of my classes this year because they all seem very interesting. I need to enjoy something to do well in it. 
__label__label0 I wonder if they sell show posters at that let's see, I have 0:00, I have until about 0:00 to write, no that's not right, yes, wait, yeah it is, anyway, I wish I could go back to new york I remember the LOCNAME LOCNAME I got to tell PROPNAME I ran into PROPNAME today and that she lives in LOCNAME, with the teletubby wrappingpaper on the door, I should tell PROPNAME too, I wonder how PROPNAME is and why hasn't she e-mailed me back, I wonder what PROPNAME's up to  right now. I got to get PROPNAME a birthday card and one for PROPNAME too. My Girl, aww that reminds me PROPNAME PROPNAME, I'm thirsty PROPNAME, I miss her I have so much work to do I want to take ballet really bad it makes me sad when I can't and I really wish I had my ponte shoes here aww daisy I wish she was here right now I wonder if she even misses me she doesn;t act like that, like she does when I get home, she could at least wag her tail or twitch an ear like Mama says awww hee hee oh I needa call LOCNAME and PROPNAME today and tell them hi I really want to see that album of pictures PROPNAME said uncle had and PROPNAME said PROPNAME goes hee hee I could be writing an e-mail for this long and not even notice it like when I write one for like I should tell Ms. PROPNAME about the press job, she'd be proud I still need to get my Savrola from churchill I wonder if they can mail it if I call and does she still work there?  I think so I think she does I wonder if she'd write back, I could just send it to churchill I hope suzanne at least found out something about josh even though veronica doesn't say much, I wish I had some degas posters to put on my wall but I wouldn't put them up there probably, I would probably just frame them cause I wouldn't want to ruin them like my dawson's creek poster, those copy max people I knew it'! I knew that'd be the poster they'd mess up with the laminating that reminds me I wonder what kind I don't remember exactly what kind of system they used in creative writing to do train of thought for a prompt that's write, I mean right! hee hee :OP  kathryn and emily, oh I have to write to her, or e-mail, that's quicker, anyway, it was some kind  of system where you type random letters or something I wonder how josh is doing I really hope suzanne found something out but I doubt she did becuase that's wierd how you can learn to type and eventually not even look ath the keys like gl said, awww I can't wait till 00nd street I wonder if gl and annette and daniel will come  back to do it and ay! those people are so loud!  quit screaming, it's like they've never been on their own before or something no control anyways maybe I'll see if anneliese can go with me to pick out a card for PROPNAME and one for robert and there was this one at LOCNAME and Noble that I wanted to get for christine, a pink cadillac, she 'll definitely like that, hee hee I can't wait till opening night that will be fun I wonder if she will be home tomorrow or tonight I hope so because I haven't written and I called the other day, but I hope she got the message, I wonder if josh got sarah's message or if he even got the card I hope so I want to watch my movies too but I have so much to catch up on. it's so cold in here I can't believe there's still like ten minutes to go, anyway, I can't wait till the a jet all the way why are you so nice to them if they annoy you so much why I can;t believe that lady sang somewhere   that's so wierd like david and mr. walker and suzanne's connected in some wierd circle to all of that it's wierd like it there really fate or, people would just say I'm relating all this stuff together because it's on my mind but things pop out at PROPNAME without her even asking, that's kind of  I wonder how long everyone else's is is it I guess it just depends how long you type snoopy awww I'm glad I brought those with me so they can sit in my dorm instead and my picture of daist mae I got to go to church this weekend too I can't wait till dc starts did I already say that, my arm' s starting to hurt Mama says it's too high like the ones at home it said don't worry about punctuation and stuff right, cause it's like train of thought I better go check at the end I wonder how many people actually type 00 min straight without stopping I'm trying anyway I guess I deserve a break but I don't want to have all this math hw in the week either I 'm so glad it's only a semester I miss PROPNAME I can't wait till she comes here it's wierd how all these twin subjects keep popping up I wonder if I should reread this cause time's almost up I can't wait to go card shopping it's fun I wonder if sara flores is back in town yet what was I saying oh I doubt people check over this I should prolly write to ms. hester sometime I was think ing about calling her but I don't know when she'd be there or have lessons or if I wonder how big little josh is now, not josh, but andrea's dog awww prolly pretty big by now I need to respond to ms martin's letter too but it sounded like she didn't expect me to respond for a while even though I prolly will and get sidetract I wonder what jessica's up to I have to get I'm working why don't they just say the problem instead of giving a number sarah thought that was funny when I said the computer talked I wonder if she ate with the cats today ha ha I should call her!  hee he :OP well time's up I guess I wonder if I should look over this prolly most people don't but  sarah says why do you check stuff so muchjust cause well time's up I guess I can stop writing now,   
__label__label0 I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 00 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 0:00 to 00:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 00 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 00,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend PROPNAME who goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 0 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! 
__label__label1 I am so completely upset with my mother. We used to be so close and now she has turned evil on me!  She's mad about my cell phone bill, well then why did she buy it for me?  I called her the majority of the time anyway. It's not like I was calling PROPNAME or PROPNAME!  I think I- aggh, she seriously thinks I have nothing better to do up here then listen to her bitch about money. I'm trying to earn a college education so I don't have to worry about money. Not that a degree will magically erase all of life's problems, but it will always let me have something to fall back on. I wish I didn't have so much to do. I have a t least 0 chapters to read for each class, and I overslept this morning, so I missed Geography! Oops, I'm seriously not too interested in how the prehistoric man evolved into what we are today, but it seems rather important that I memorize it all now for the sake of the essay test yet to come. What's that all about anyway, essaytests?  Why not just give mc tests like the rest of the world? How boring would that be to read 000 essays over geography? Feel kinda bad for that man. I think that college should come with a scheduled in nap time. Everyone gets tired, it should just be one extra hour where you take your mat and blanket just like in kindergarden and go to your assigned building and sleep! If you show up you get a C if you doze off and on you get a B and if you knonk out you get an A!  Sounds good doesn't it!  It could count as an elective, and those with the hardest classes and the furthest to walk would get to register first!  I'm so smart I scare myself!! Just kidding, well. I still need to find brown shoes. Brown dress shoes, I have this brown dress to wear to this 00th anniversary party, and I don't have shoes!  I feel kinda like the girl in clueless. ohmygod, no shoes whatever will I do?  Seriously, after I enactmy nap time plan, I am going to create a brown dress shoe company. I will make a fortune, because I will be the only person in the world that makes brown shoes!  One day. I have a monster headache, I think it's my contacts, I should probably change them, has it been two weeks? I don't think so!  I'm a responsible person, I just forget to do things sometimes! I had to got to the postoffice today. That was neat. I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like a dumb teenage girl who had never been in any sort of public "Official" place. I'll try to stay away from there. Well it's been 00 min! Goodbye!    
__label__label0 I should have done this assingment sooner. It is a different type of assignment from ones I usually get. It is hard to write out what I am thinking about. I can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe I can but I just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that I think about, especially someone I don't really know. I think that is the reason I put off this assignment for so long. I didn't know if I wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. I don't know if I thought I would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if I just wanted to keep them secret. Not that any of them would be embarrassing. I think that I mostly  just didn't want to have to write them down. It doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. I was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if I would actually get off at nine. I also thought about an internet friend from LOCNAME who I haven't talked to in a while. But I didn't think those were too interesting to write about so I began to think about other things. It is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. Just the other day, I was trying to write a philosophy paper and I thought I would be able to write it very easily. But when I actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. I knew what I wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. I became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause I couldn't expand my thoughts. I believe that I could have written a beautiful paper but at the times I sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and I couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. I htink that I have this problem often, but usually I can overcome my "writer's block" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. I think that is another reason I put this assignment off for so long. I made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have "writer's block. "  I seemed to not be thinking about anything so I couldn't just put my thoughts down. I was also worried about writing about the right things, but I realized it doesn't mater what I write about, it is just supposed to be what I am thinking. These twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and I feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. I have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that I don't have to think too much about them. I just need to write and not worry about how "stupid" I think they sound. 
__label__label1 00 minutes. that's a long time. I'm not sure if I have enought thoughts to fill 00 minutes. that's a lot of seconds too. 00 x 00 = 00000 seconds, I think. unless I put one too many zero's and then I suppose it wouldn't be too bad. luckily, I have a timer for the kitchen that my grandmother just sent me for my birthday that I can use to keep track of this writing assignment. I'm also listening to some tunes as I write this. I don't know if that is allowed, but I think I would get too bored if I didn't get to listen to music. I love listening to music very much. and I love belle and sebastian very much which is what I happen to be listening too now. unfortunately, I can not sing nor do I have the ability to play any musical instruments. what a sad sad state of affairs. I am also drinking some orange soda as I write this. mmmmm, orange soda. I just baked a pineapple upside down cake and I think that I just might have turned out well. as well as a pineapple upside down cake can be I suppose. later tonight I think I am going to visit my strange friend PROPNAME and his roommate adam. they are having a little gathering there. it's a good thing I don't have school tomorrow. esp. since I have tons of work to do and I haven't done any of it yet. I have gotten far behind these first couple of weeks. some of it is because of the recent move but that's just an excuse for the most part. I'd just rather be doing other things than homework lots of the time. I really need to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I don't want to work just yet, so that means more school. I am positive that law school is notthe place for me to be. maybe public policy, but even that I'm not all that sure of. maybe someone will offer me a job where all I do is sit around all day playing jezzball, looking cute. maybe they'll pay me lots of money for that. wouldn't that be nice. I'm sure that I wouldnt' be the only applicatant for a job that sweet. I also need to figure out what on earth I'm going to do for my junior fellows project. dean carver is going to freak out if I don't come up with something soon. I'm such a slacker, I don't' know why they keep letting me do stuff at this university. I worry for PROPNAME and her three hours of school this semester. I don't think that's such a good idea. how easy will it be for her to justify dropping that one class? far too. I don't know what she thinks she's going to do with the rest of her life. run off with michael wherever he decides to go in may? that will hardly work for anyone. yikes. they just got back from some kind of party and they were way overdressed. that is pretty funny. I don't' know why they didn't just suck it up. but I guess that would have made them look kind of stupid. I think that this is an interesting turn of events. I also hope that someone doesn't read over my shoulder because I might get in just a little trouble for typing some of the things that I am saying. jessica is complainging about being fat. let me just take this time to mention taht it is fine time for me to get out and exercise or something like that. I guess I won't ever be as thin as I was when I was 00, but it's hard to face that fact. well, they left again, so it's just me and the orange soda and belle aand sebastian again. that's more like I like it. althought michael hasn't benn over here as much since jessica is pissed at him more often these days. it's kind of nice to have him out of my hair. I am suprised that mindy has not yet called today. she is so nuts, I don't even know what to do with her. I am afraid that she might tell catherine some of the things that we've said to her recently since she's so pipolar and loving of catherine two days after she tells her that they're not going to live together next year or buy groceries together. what a nut case. they're all nuts I tell you. not me exculded, just eeeveryone that I know. where are all the sane people in this world? are they hiding out at home afraid to come out because all of us wacko's are walking around outside? wouldn't that be a funny sight to behold. I hope that I can find someone to teach me to play GO. I don't want to have this board just sitting around the house with nothing to do with it. talk about impluse buys. I guess there are worse things to spend money on, but I can't think of what that would be right now. mmm. I want to smoke. this 00 minutes is killing me. so I smoking I suppose, but since I'm not all that excited about living until I'm 00, it's okay that I'm taking seven minutes off my life or whatever that urban legend is. I need to take a shower soon, if I think I'm going out to any kind of party. with this short short hair and all this gunk that I've been putting in it, it is imperative that I wash it soon. it's looking pretty greasy. I'm not sure about this short hair just yet. PROPNAME says that it looks sophisticated, but I think it just looks short. I've never ever had my  hair this short. it grows back I guess. I do kind of like the fact that I don't have to do anything with it and that it's not in my way in the slightest bit. that's what I get for letting philip choose what to do with it. that's also what I get for being so indecisive. I'm also worried that these bangs things are going to acause my forhead to break out because they sitting there all teh time. oohhh, the timer just rang and it scared the living bageezers out of me. 
__label__label0 I feel very tired and alone. My room is too quiet to sleep, if that is possible and I don't have anyone to talk to since my roomate is out of town. The fan is on high right now to try to create some noise and keep me cool and comfortable, but the mugginess and isolation are too much to allow me to get any meaningful rest. It seems as though me clothes are permanently stuck to my chest and back. There is hardly any noise in my room besides the sound of the fan and the typing sound of my keyboard. I like to type as fast as possible so that the keys make almost a musical harmony. Besides the occasional loneliness, I am very happy with my new life here at college. My ex-girlfriend from high school came in for the weekend to see me, and I had a great time. however, I don't think that I would like for her to come to college with me. She goes to ORGNAME and although I don't get to see her as much as I would like, I think that I saw her too much when we were together. It makes for sort of an awkward situation, but I have a lot of freedom, and at the same time, quite a bit of security knowing that she still cares about me and loves me. I don't like to say goodbye to her, though. She holds me and kisses me all weekend, but when it is time to go, she gets more depressed than she was when she hadn't seen me for weeks. Sometimes I get scared about her being so home-sick. She stopped eating for a while, but only told me about it today. It made me upset to think of someone who was too upset about college to eat. Everyone ends up saying college is the best time of their life, so I think that people should just forget about being homesick and try to get to the fun stuff as soon as possible. I like to have my own place, my own stuff, and a new group of friends. For the first time in my life, I can use self-control and discipline which I lacked back in high school. Back then, I figured that my parents could try to catch me if they could, but here, it's either be smart or lose out on a great opportunity to get an education and make connections. My parents do still have some say in my behavior though. They are the ones that tote most of the bills for me and recently rejected my request to join a fraternity. I was really excited to get my bid and go through the pledge stuff, knowing all along that my parents would make me wait out the first semester until joining. I wanted to make some new friends outside of the ten or so good friends that came here from high school with me. Oh well, I guess that parents know best, and I didn't challenge them too much with this decision. I'm sure that I could still join today, with the use of a little charm and a minor guilt trip. But, they are probably right on this one, so I'll let them win. The weather here seems to give me frequent nose-bleeds, unless I am just picking it more than usual (a little humor even though no one but me is listening). I love to joke around about things. The nose bleeds may be caused by some sort of anxiety or stress about being in a new place. I used to wake up with them all the time when I first moved from LOCNAME to LOCNAME. I thought that it was the driness, but now that I have them again, you can't help but wonder. Time seems to go by quickly when I get to ramble on about life and myself. Does that mean that I am arrogant or self centered, that's probably it. The phone just rang and got me off track, but it's about time to go anyways. I try to correct all my mistakes during this writing even though I know that I don't have to. The work of good teachers or just a perfectionist, you make the call. Actually, I think that the bloody nose may have come from being hit during a game of basketball the other day. Maybe it is just a coincidence. Psychologists always over examine things I think. The answer the usually right in front of their nose, but they think about it too much and get too deep. Was that a pun? 
__label__label1 Well, since my friend just told me how she neglected to get us these free random  glow in the dark condoms, I've got sex on the brain, not that I've even had sex before. It's just one of those things that jumps in my head two or three times a day. I think it's because it's one of those unknown things I haven't experienced yet. I really wish I was back at home sitting on my bed, with my dog at my feet, waiting for my brother to come in and keep me up talking about my poor relationship problems which I still to this day haven't figured out. I miss him, my boyfriend/ friend/ player/ love or whatever. All I know is that I had fun with him no matter what was going on in my life. He could and still can always make me laugh. I miss that. I just plain miss him. And I'm not saying that I never once thought of having sex with him but it was never a real issue. He made me smile and never upset me. Well, that's not completely true. sometimse he upset me but it wasn't his fault. Unfortunately, I loved him a lot more than he loved me even though he really and truly loved me a lot. sometimes  I wonder if he is gay. I know that sounds odd but maybe   . no forget it. I'n so exhausted and all I want to do is go to sleep in my own bed under a real homy roof. I know it sounds funny becaouse they're probably all asleep but I wonder what they're doing- mY family and PROPNAME and my other long lost friends who off at some far away college. poor PROPNAME is out at sea. I hope it's not raining on him. THe food here is good but I don't like having some one tell me when I have to eat and when I can't. There is no refrigerator with ORGNAME ORGNAME stuffed in the back. And most of all, there is no ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Oh, guys I wish I was there to teach my little kids and have them run up and hug my leg. I wish I had my senior class back cause I have so many great ideas from new pop songs I've heard here in LOCNAME. Why can't I just skip the whole college thing. I know ican do it and I have the abiltiy and the committment to finish, PROPNAME don't think I need to . I want to run a dance studio  . I need to be going to conventions and new York and watching my previous dance instructor run the agenda and show me the accounting not learning about some stupid coorporations that I'll never want a job from or need an interview from. I just want to do what I've been doing best for the last 00 years and that is choreograph real dance in my own studio with my own ideas and expectations. It's my dream and its getting away from me. school seems second now and I really don't care. I've put it first most of the rest of my life. I did my 00 years now I want my career, my dream. I still want to dance myself but that is possible except not here in LOCNAME where most of the studios are for elementary and the directors are real snots. people should want you to dance with them especially if you have a good attitude. but my bed is calling to me and I still have some very important e-mails to take care of. it's so nice to know that some people care enough at least to type. 
__label__label0 well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were "men". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 00 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now. 
__label__label0 Hello my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am a biology major. I plan to go to medicall school some day and I hope to become an orthopeodic surgeon. I did not become interested in orthopeodic surgery until I hurt my knee the first game ORGNAME the football season my senior year in high school. I tore three ligaments and blew seventy percent of my cartilage in my left knee. I used to want to be an orthodontist until this injury but my interests changed with the surgey and all. School is very importtant to me although in high school I can honestly say that I did not try my hardest. I did weell enough to get by and to get into the ORGNAME of ORGNAME but I did not do my best. From this point forward I strive to be the best that I can be in school and whatever I do so that I can get into a medical school, hopefully somewhere in LOCNAME. I grew up and lived most of my childhood in dallas texas and that is where my dad lives. I have a lot of friends that live there and I really like dallas. It holds  a special place I my heart because of all of my experiences there. I moved to mIdland texas in the seventh grade and went to high school there at midland high. it is really neat to hear you talk about midland, Dr. PROPNAME, in our class. I had many great thigns happen to me while I was in midland and one of those things is my long term girlfriend of five years, PROPNAME PROPNAME. She means the world to me and I  hope I mean the  world to her. She ended up at texas tech university but hopefully she is going to transfer to ORGNAME at the start of next school year for the fall of 0000. I am going to las vegas with her and her family in september for her birthday and I think that will be fun. it will be hot in las vegas and I look forward to seeing the beachboys and PROPNAME PROPNAME live at my hotel. I miss her terribly and I haven't seen her since the 00 of August. her mom and dad constantly send me email and little care packages and I hope someday I will marry this girl. I want to live somewhere in the country but somewhere that I don't have to drive that far to work. I want to live outside of a big city because I want to be a weell known doctor that people from all over teh country go to in order to get there bones fixed. that has always been a goal of mine and I plan to carry it out. I hope to have kids someday and raise them the same  way my dad raised me because I can't complain. I grew up in a chrch going family and just came to really know the Lord abotu two years ago. Church is very important to me although I havent found a church here in LOCNAME that I am just wild about. I am a freshman yousee and I havenot been heree that long. that is my life story wrapped up in just a little bit of time but I guess that was my stream of conciousness because that is what I thought about when I was writing. 
__label__label0 The Complete Works of Shakespere is a very large book and although I've skimmed  through King PROPNAME and PROPNAME and a little bit of the old Twelfth Night, I reckon  it would take me about a year and a half reading every day to get through that  whole book. I'm glad I could change my schedule during add/drop because getting  up at eight just would have not happened at all. PROPNAME PROPNAME, she lastest and  the greatest of them all. did you know the world was waiting just for you oo ooo  PROPNAME PROPNAME or PROPNAME, however big you think you are areaeaereare. You'll get  yours yet. PROPNAME's massage to the alternative take to this song. All those  weird little encounters. This assignment better be like confidential. A man's  thoughts word for word over twenty minutes by definition should be filled with  nasty gutter talk and such, but for the sake of the grader, this stream of  continuous mental blabber shall be filtered convieniently for filthynesses sake. Helter Skelter would you want me to make you? Tell me tell me tell me the answer  Helter Skelter Helter Skelter Helter Skelter ooooooo!  Aw here she come! Nice  slide guitar work ther, PROPNAME, when I get to the botom I go back to the top of  the slide Do you don't you want me to make you? Comin dowm fast but don't let me  break you. You may be a lover, but you aint no dancer. Helter Skelter Helter  Skelter  LOOK OUT!  ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (slide guitar guitar guitar) THis  is fun. Noise, and back into the song once more. once more. Hahahaha. Next  cut, fellows. It's not necessary to go on for say fifteen minutes. Now a nice  quiet one. No one will ever read this. Time to change the announcement on my  answering machine. I'll have my computer do it again, but in a differnt voice  than that man voice named PROPNAME or whatever. I must go PROPNAME PROPNAME's office hours  today and hand in me homework, lest I be penalized. Where is RLM?  Where will I  go after that. Will I take a shower. Yes. Will I wear my pledge pin or on the  same plane, will I wear a collard shirt around campus this afternoon. I've had  a pleasant and not so well deserved morning lounging around the room while my  good buddy went off to an 0oclock class this morning. Too bad for him, although  I probably should have ittited off to PROPNAME PROPNAME's. We go over stuff that I know  too well already, but the homework definately should have been put up then. After Pledge Line I probably will not make class in the morning Friday, but I  know that I really should go. That would be a very terrible habit to fall into  although I know many upperclassmen that not only do not go to class on a whim,  but sell back half their newly bought books Like Brent right at the beginning of  the semester just for full retail reimbursement and on hopes to just wing it all  from the course packets and what not. I'ts funny when people in conversation  use "and whatnot. " It really says a lot about tha speaka and grabs the  attention of the listener because that little turn of the tongue is not too  oftern used any more. THe directions said not to pay attention to sentence  structure and such a dn that is good because right now I am mayor of run-on  city. I suppose those who waste the time to right all this down on paper first  and transcribe their stuff will pretty it up a bit and the experiment will be  botched like that. enough. I used to do this kind of stuff in 0th grade En 
__label__label1 Right now I am sitting by the phone debating on whether or not I should call this guy who is both my friend and currently the guy I have a crush on. He lives in PROPNAME so I miss him a lot. I also have this nervous/excited feeling. I can feel my heart race. I tried calling earlier and talked to his dad - I think. I don't know what to do! My roommate just walked in and smells nice because she just took a shower - reminding me that I still have to shower sometime tonight. I keep thinking about all the things I still have to do tonight - like shower, read for journalism, read for art history, back my bag, someday soon wash some clothes, and maybe clean up a little. Just random things but I don't have much time because my roommate goes to bed early and I/m such the night person. Getting up is a pain in the ass though. Those 0am classes are hard. I'm so tempted to skip but I never will because school is important to me and especially my parents! What a mess of papers on my bed!  Too much to do and too lazy to do it. I just thought about my email. I love email. I check it all the time and am so disappointed when there is nothing new. I had a crazy email crisis this morning. I hit the wrong key and sent all my mail and a folder to the trash can. What a scare!  I recovered it though but was almost late to art class. Now I can't help but think what to write next. I am still thinking about the phone as time goes by because I have to call - if I am going to call - before 00 pm. I guess I won't call tonight because it will probably just stress me out or bother me. I am done with class by 00:00 tomorrow so I will call late in the day. I miss him and worry about him and so desperately want to see him. He makes me feel so comfortable and always makes me laugh. I can't open up with many people as easily as I can with him. I miss him and wish I could might more people like him. I just don't know where I stand with him and I wish I did. I worry now that time to stop approaches if I said enough because I type rather slow but I did put honesty and effort into this. It is weird opening up for this assignment.

__label__label0 Well, I don't know where to begin. I guess it started when she came over for lunch. I never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. She swooped in and plopped herself on my new Pappason chair. She was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. As she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the Hit or Miss store I noticed it. How her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. I mean, don't get me wrong PROPNAME is the best friend I have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. As she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. It was barely noticeable that my over grown Lab  PROPNAME had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. Then the words just fell out of her mouth. "He's come to rescue me, and I'm going to go. " I have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. I was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. My best friend was on her way to her life long dream. All I could do was cry and hug her. Then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. There was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and CELEBRATE! Wow. She's gone. What is left of me? I sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. I mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. I don't know how long. It seems like a whole season passed. Then one day, I got tired of crying. I knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and I'd be darned if I was going to let it rot inside of me. So, I did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. I joined a club. I went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. But you know what, I didn't find it. So, I began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. I left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. But, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to meet myself a man. I will find out what love is all about, and I mean real love. So, take that! Thus, my Man PROPNAME began. I browsed the Video Dating services, the internet (big mistake, HUGE), I scoped men at the grocery store, I bought some roller blades and tried out Hike and Bike trails, but nope, nothing'. Oh, I met men all right, but the kind of guys I met made me want to swear off of them forever. Yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. He's out there, my PROPNAME is going to come rescue me, I just have to have faith in real love. After some serious time had passed, I stepped out of my life and looked at what I had, and noticed that my Many PROPNAME had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. So I just plum gave up. I was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. And that was it. So, I dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then I began to pray. It helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when I shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? My heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. How in the world can the words I choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the Lord? He is the absolute perfect gentleman. I began to talk with Him every day. I began to listen for His voice and I began to find Him everywhere I went. I realized, I was never alone. I was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. The lord God in Heaven loves me, and I love Him. And you know what else, after I gave my heart to PROPNAME, I met PROPNAME. Would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 0 Great Danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as Dixie bolted out my front door. We met, just that simply. He has arrived at my front door now, so I better go. We are on our way to LOCNAME oh how I love to be rescued! 
__label__label1 I feel so tired. I was so awake until I walk into calculus in which the voice of the professor just made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. Then my mind kept wandering. The year has just begun and I'm realizing that work is just going to get worse. I have to write a rough draft for RHE 000 that will be due next Monday. I have to start working on that. Then I have to remember that after Rhetoric and Composition that I have to cross the LOCNAME LOCNAME and go to the Mezes building so I can sign up for some experiments for Psych class. I would rather do experiments instead of writing a 0page research paper. Then my mind always wanders to this weekend. It will be a special weekend because it will be the onemonth anniversary of my boyfriend and me. I don't know what to get him. I have to remember to ask my best friend for suggestions. He's my first boyfriend ever and he has done so much for me. I don't know what I would do without him. I am so happy that my first boyfriend is someone special because I've heard of first boyfriends that don't mean much other than they're their first boyfriends. Then again, most girls have had their first boyfriends when they were as young as in grade school. I'm in college now. It's a little different I would think. Now, what do I get for him? It's such a hard question to answer and I'm low on cash. Well, I'm not low on cash, it's just that I'm given a $00 allowance for each week and I've already used up 0 weeks worth of allowances in less than a week. I need to be able to budget my money more. Then I've been using up my dining dollars faster than I should be. I'm about $00 under than where I should be. I'm really not good with keeping track of my money. Then I have so much reading to do in all my classes. The only class that doesn't require much of my time is calculus. Unbelievable! I'm so thankful that I took calculus in high school or I would be so lost because it's hard to understand everything the professor is saying. If I go back to visit high school, I'm going to go thank Ms. PROPNAME for being a great calculus teacher. I went looking through my psychology book and there are so many interesting things in there. There are some funny quotes and cartoons in there. I always found psychology interesting thanks to my psych teacher in high school. That reminds me, I'll have to thank Ms. PROPNAME too for being a great psych teacher. Oh, looks like time is up!  
__label__label0 Wow, that psychology chapter is really long. I am so mad at myself for letting myself get so far behind already. Hello, it's only my third week of school and I am already more behind than I ever want to be. I wonder if typing on my computer bothers PROPNAME as much as it bothers me when she does it. Do I have enough selfdiscipline to make myself catch up on all this stuff or am I just going to keep procrastinating until I absolutely have to get it done, like the night before a test. I really hope I can make myself catch up because then I can go out and have fun and not have to worry about what I have to do when I get home. I don't know why I let that bother me so much. Last night, I wasn't really having any fun at all and they all said it was the funnest party of the year. I wonder if it's because I didn't get completely wasted or if it's because I don't like their idea of fun, or if I was just in a bad mood. And why would they think there's something going on between me and PROPNAME. EWW! I mean he's nice, but come on. I thought this wasn't going to be like high school. Shouldn't I be able to be friends with a guy without everyone thinking there's something going on between us? Eww! Oh, well. I hope I have more fun with them soon. I would hate to have just joined this organization that they all seen to be totally into and me just not like it at all. I want to be able to gush about how much I love it to all of my friends and family back home and the ones here. What if it turns out I hate Longhorn Singers? That would really be a shame. What if I can't find any organizations I can really get into here? Like the whole dance thing. I looked at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and they looked like a drill team trying to dance with really bad choreography. And the Roustabouts just seems a little too provocative for me even though I think jazz is so fun. Why does it have to be all about sex (as PROPNAME says) I really want to take some kind of jazz class because I need to expand my horizons so I can move to LOCNAME LOCNAME or LOCNAME LOCNAME and be a dancer on LOCNAME or a backup dancer for some music artist or in someone's music video. Would it be great if I could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that I could live comfortably? If that was guaranteed, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wonder if this is what I'm really passionate about. All the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do. I mean I have so much fun when I dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me. It would just be fun a job of pure fun. But, come on, who really gets to do what they really want to do. Who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man? People do what they do to make money and I think that's so sad, but I'm one of those people, too. Money is important to me. It doesn't rule my life but it is definitely a factor. I don't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what I deserve or what I've earned for it. And our society is just completely out of whack. Why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws? Why are teachers so underpaid? They should be some of the highest paid people in the world, I think. Because of them, we are able to learn. We would be nowhere without our teachers. That's such a shame. It pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality. Just look at LOCNAME. What a mixed up place that is, yet it looks like so much fin to me. I would love to be famous. To have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them. That would be a blast. All you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines. Go to awards shows, and travel. I want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages. But I don't want to learn them part way. I want to be fluent in the way that I don't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think I'm stupid like we do when someone can't speak our language correctly. I wonder what that would be like to change cultures. No one would know anything about you or your past. Like PROPNAME. You could be a total loser/reject in our society and be a heartthrob/most popular kid in school in another country. And you're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you. 
__label__label0 I feel really good today because it is my birthday. I'm looking forward to being with my friends later on today. I'm thinking about tonight because my fraternity is having a match with the ZETAs. I'm pretty excited about it because they are the hottest girls I've seen so far. I kind of would like to go home though and see some of my friends back home. A lot of them are making trips back home this weekend to see some concert. I also would like to see my family on my birthday but I am sure I will see them soon. I don't really know what else I should write about except my birthday because it's all I have been thinking about this week. I plan to go pre party after I finish this writing assignment. So far I am loving it here in LOCNAME and am really glad I chose to come school up here. The size of my classes is quite a surprise and something I just have to get used to. I really enjoy having all the freedom here compared to back home in LOCNAME. I wish I had more time to just hang out but I stay really busy lately. Being a pledge in a fraternity really can be time consuming but it is worth it. I've met so many people these last three weeks and I'm sure it will be the same for the rest of the semester. Now I'm beginning to draw blank and can't think of much to write. Oh well, it's not like anyone will actually read this passage. I've got five minutes left on my time. I am so glad to be out of high school. College is much better though there is a lot of work to be done. My date better look good tonight in her eighties outfit for the party. The theme is an eighties prom but I just went got some clothes that look like their from the eighties. I can't wait to see what other people are going to be wearing. Well time is up. 
__label__label1 Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for ORGNAME ORGNAME and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named PROPNAME. She went to ORGNAME. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of PROPNAME. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. PROPNAME makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the LOCNAME LOCNAME has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. 
__label__label0 I have so much on my mind right now. It seems as if my world is changing in every way from every aspect. I have been told by someone close to me (my ex girlfriend) that I have changed. She will not tell me what she means or in what way I have changed. It bothers me more and more all the time. I can't see how I have changed. I have looked at every aspect of my life and personality and have yet to find any feeling different than that which I felt three months ago. I don't want her to be upset with me. I just wish she would tell me why. I feel like I am continuously trying to make everyone around me happy. I spend so much time being the listener of other people's problems. I just sit there and listen to them and when they want feedback I provide it to the best of my ability. The only problem is that sometimes I want to talk to someone. But people do not usually seem to have the same time for me. I usually find my own way of dealing with things such as bowling. Bowling is great stress relief. You challenge yourself only and get to throw heavy objects at other heavy objects to improve your score. I am not a violent person at all. but I do feel better after a few games of bowling. I enjoy talking to people about things and helping them with their problems. It just seems like there are a lot of problems out there for which I have no advice to give. It's as if I am letting them down. I am somewhat worried right now. Mainly about what will happen when I finish this thought process. I have to go to my fraternity house and help work on one of our pledge class's projects. I am tired and feel overwhelmed by what I have to do. I have schoolwork, friends, and fraternity. Any one of these could easily take all of my time. Yet here I am trying to budget all of it in. I realize that schoolwork comes first, but I do not want to give up my fun time. I enjoy fraternity but it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Right now if I had one wish it would be for me to never need sleep again. That would give me another 0 hours to get my daily tasks done. I guess maybe I should think of some good things too. Life can't be all bad. I have met so many new people since arriving at LOCNAME. I have made friends with people whom I can already tell have the potential to be lifelong friends. College has been like starting over. I have friends who also came to ORGNAME. But I rarely see them. And those who I did not get along with, I have yet to see thanks to the incredibly large campus. This is probably one of the most interesting assignments I have ever one. It has been a very long time since I simply sat down and wrote my feelings. In fact, this is the first time since I arrived at LOCNAME that I have had the opportunity to think about how I really feel. I actually feel better knowing where I stand on some of the most important aspects of my life. I will definitely make sure to read this again. maybe in a day or so. I might even do this assignment over again on my own in a week or so to see if and how my feelings have changed. I need new shoes. I stepped in a deep water puddle the other day and soaked them inside and out. It is time for a new pair of shoes anyway. I actually saw a student walking to class without shoes the other day. I can't imagine walking down the streets of campus without shoes. Why am I thinking about shoes? What time is it? Only one minute left. I have really enjoyed this assignment. I hope the upcoming writing assignments are as interesting as this one has been. Time is up. 
__label__label1 It is 0:00pm and I have decided to use my break between classes to tackle this writing assignment. I am not even in my dorm because my we ordered my computer and it hasn't come in yet. I am typing this from my friend's computer. She lives two doors down from me at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Life is a really funny thing because it is so unpredictable. For example, three weeks before school started I was in a really bad car wreck. In the accident I broke my patella from the impact of my knee crashing against the dash. I have been in a brace to immobilize my knee and crutches ever since. So now I have to crutch around campus. it's terrible. I am having a really hard time writing this paper because there are no rules or criteria. I absolutely hate having no outline, it drives me crazy. I am the kind of person that needs very specific and detailed guidelines. Otherwise I panic because I not sure if I am doing is exactly what is expected. My classes so far seem really fun. All of my professors are really interesting and down to earth. My one concern is on Monday because I have two classes back to back that are on opposite sides of campus. I can't believe that I am on my own. My parents have been such a major part of my life because of snow skiing injury. My freshman year of high school I hit a tree while skiing and broke my femur. The brake went through my growth plate so I had major complications. I was completely dependent on my parents for everything. I couldn't walk, carry things, or even sleep through the nights. I've had 0 surgeries on my leg and I have been homebound from school for half of a semester. When I was homebound I had so much time to think about anything and everything. The main thing that I concentrated on when I was home was learning how to roll with the punches. I am an extreme perfectionist, which makes me very uptight about every little detail. Most people would assume that it is a good quality to be a perfectionist, but I beg to differ. A perfectionist gets so overwhelmed by the tiny mistakes that he forgets to look at the big picture. As a perfectionist your job is never finished because there is always something that could be improved. It's a terrible quality, it really is. My roommate is not really a perfectionist, but she is a neat freak so that is good. I am so lucky that I got paired up with such an awesome roommate. Her name is PROPNAME, and I love her to death. Its almost like we are the same person. We hit it off right from the start. What I like about college is that you aren't penalized for being yourself. In high school I was often accused of being fake. Sorry that I am a really friendly girl and I try to get along with everybody. College is such a big step in life, I feel like I am starting a new life almost. My three fiends from home are going to school here and they have an apartment at Melrose. I feel like they are my family now. They are three really great guys that I graduated with. I make sure their house stays clean and their schoolwork is taken care of. In return they make sure I am taking care of my knee and that I don't get too stressed out. It is such a warm feeling to know that someone cares about you. I think it is so important to show someone that you love them everyday, and to know that you are loved everyday. I was raised in a very affectionate family so that is what I am used to and what I need to get me through each day. Well the timer just went off, twenty minutes is up. I look forward to a great semester with you. 
__label__label0 I woke up this morning and my words from last night at 0am, "Can I have a 0 piece chicken tender and small fries to go" echoed in my ears. I felt guilty. Within five minutes of ordering I had scarfed down the whole thing. Although my body wasn't hungry, I was thinking about food and I started to have major cravings for something filling. I sent myself on a mission to quench my thoughts, not my stomach. Is it normal to eat when you think about food and your body isn't hungry? Does thinking about food imply that you really are hungry even though your stomach isn't growling? This also brings up the issue of will power. I usually have strong will power, but with food it is another story. My body feels weighted down by guilt today. I went to Tops the other day to look at pictures and I looked fat in all the pictures I saw of myself. I'm sure every freshman promises themselves that they won't gain the dreaded "freshman fifteen. " I refuse to believe that it is an inevitable event in my life right now. I know how to avoid gaining the weight; exercise, eat healthy food, and above all, don't have late night snacks. My will power crumbles late at night when I see food or if my belly doesn't have that full feeling. Getting out of bed I could feel the unused calories building up in my body. I didn't eat breakfast and went to the gym where I worked out for almost two hours today in hopes of burning off last night's calorie fest and hopefully today's too. When I returned to my room I was in a bad mood, felt very lonely and as I told my mom, "I'm not feeling like myself. " I was depressed. I only felt good about myself today when I was exercising. I wanted to go eat lunch, but I felt guilty about even thinking about eating. I love to eat. It brings me satisfaction, comfort, and pleasure. However, my body image tampers with my enjoyment. I am not over weight but I feel like it. As strong, smart, and confident as I am about myself and who I am, I have been sucked into the belief that I ought to be skinny. It is amazing how easily my mood depends on my eating habits. 
__label__label1 I feel a little behind in everything I am doing for school. I have a hard time reading for long periods of time. My eyes cannot stay focused for very long and words become blurry. It's a constant struggle to understand each sentence. I'm not sure if I have always had this problem. I can read novels fairly easy. I really hate being in class with a lot of people. I don't like to interact with them. They seem to be very clueless over the important parts of the material covered in each session. I'm tired of stupid Internet questions that waste class time. If I had a computer question, I wouldn't stop class to ask it and make myself look stupid like most computer illiterate students. Students in psychology seem to pretend that they are interested in what is taught, but they really are not fully in to the subject. There are so many students who claim they are psychology majors, when in fact, after they take Psy000, they'll change their minds to something over and over until they slide into the working class. I cannot understand many of my peers. Their conversations are pointless and insignificant to their life as a whole. They spend so much time conversing over issues that they usually don't care about. I dislike the general public in the college atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoy the professors, but I can't get any intelligent feedback from my peers. I realize I'm not perfect, by any means, but at least I attempt to improve my intellectual state, somewhat. There are way too many sheltered students. I assume that professors have a hard time, especially with freshman, in trying to relate cultural differences. It must be extremely difficult to maintain the patience required to teach any level of pupils. Students forget that they are the ones paying for the class and the professor. Even in college, they still act as thought they're being forced to attend each session and assigned a certain professor. Most of the time, students fail to research their professors before they sign up for their class. I suppose it takes all kinds to make a world. 
__label__label1 Well, I've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. Right now, I'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. Recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. I think PROPNAME was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. I just found out today that the classes I plan on taking over the next 0 and a half years will earn me a BS in Computer science, and a BS in Mathematics. At first I just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when I was talking to Dr. PROPNAME today he told me that I should check to see how much of the major I would be completing. I hope a double major will help me get into grad school. Right now I really want to go to PROPNAME PROPNAME to do my grad work. They have a really great CS program there. That's assuming of course that I remain a CS major over the next few years. But I don't see my interests changing or anything. I really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. We're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. Luckily this is typed and not spoken. Well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. I misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. Its really bugging me, so I think I'll go fix it right now. I know that if I look around my room I'll see something that I want to talk about. Usually that subject will be computer related. Its really sad. (Sad but true dear reader) Why does that make me think of high school. Weird flashback I guess. Never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because I had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. All extremely intelligent. I wish I could meet more intelligent people here. Most of the people I know are either average, or just plain dumb. I did meet some cool people in my CS 000 class. But its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. That reminds me of the math problem I solved today. Professor Freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. He encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. Well, so far I'm the only one I know who came up with a solution to his problem. The last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. I wrote a dinky little program in C to compute all the data, and then I pasted it all into Excel to plot it. Right now I have another program like that running. Its been running for about 000 hours right now. Something like that. Its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking. I wonder how long I've been typing. Probably at least 00 minutes. I really haven't been keeping time. Oh well, once this hits a page on size 00 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when I paste it on the web). My DVD player comes in pretty soon. I've been waiting for at least a month because the first one I got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. I need to buy some DVDs for it. Probably will get the ORGNAME DVDs even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. I like anime. 
__label__label0 This computer lab, LOCNAME LOCNAME, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. 
__label__label1 its 00:00 and I'm listening to an old episode of Saturday Night Live in my friends' room. I need a computer. I don't know why I didn't bring mine. I'm hungry. I can't eat because I have to type this assignment. PROPNAME has a lot of pictures. This is a pretty funny snl sketch. I have nothing to say. MY back feels a little sore. I'm slightly offended that there aren't any pictures with me in them. I don't want to do this anymore. I want to watch tv, instead of just listening to it. I really don't have anything important going through my head. It was nice of PROPNAME to let me stay in here and do this. Her and her roommate left, so I'm not even sure I'm supposed to be here. This song isn't that bad. I have never heard of the musical guest on this episode of SNL but the song really isn't bad. I really should have eaten before I started this. I'm about to pass out. Only 00 more minutes. I should call home later. I'm quite upset that I couldn't do the pretesting survey thing for the experiments. Maybe I'll try again in a little while. I want to change the channel. Some station has to be showing the U. S. Open. They just have to. I think someone keeps trying to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, but I can't tell them it isn't her, because I'm doing this. I'm interested how this assignment will tell how my mind works. It should be good to know. I hope someone explains it, preferably Professor What's his name. I would check to see what his name is, but again, I Can't. Just looking around the room now. This is kind of boring (no offense). Only 0 more minutes. Cool. The only bad part is I have to stay here until PROPNAME and PROPNAME get back because I can't lock up. There are just a lot of pictures in here. There are many of PROPNAME's boyfriend PROPNAME. Interesting that she's dating someone with the same name as me, isn't it. Snl is over and only 0 minutes until I'm done. That is a stupid picture PROPNAME has next to her printer. I like the opening music on this show (The Kids In the Hall). only 0 minutes left. That's good because I am still very hungry. This is very boring. I thought about using a lot of big words, but I realized that that isn't how I think so I should just stick with my sixth grade vocabulary. This isn't a very funny sketch. Phone's ringing, can't answer it. They told me not to. It's PROPNAME. she knows I'm here but I still can't answer the phone. she isn't going to like this. I'm done. 
__label__label1 As I sit here, I wonder what I got myself into. I came from a school of 000 people. I graduated with a senior class of 00. The University is such a huge place, I wonder if I'm going to fit in, or should I say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. It's not that I don't like my classes that I have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but I wonder what the future holds. My birthday is today, and I am finally 00. It seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. But now that I finally made it, it's no different. My mom called this morning to wish me a Happy Birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. Her little baby girl is now 00. She asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. My grandparents also called this morning. They live across the street from my old house, and I was continuously over there visiting them. She told me that she still thinks that I'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. She says it's like I'm gone for the weekend, but I'll return soon. And my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. Every time I look at him, I see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. Raising 0 kids is no easy job. The day after their 00th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 00 grandchildren, 00 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. I was going to read for the mass. I went up to the podium and I looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. I was so proud to be a part of that. I was thankful that God allowed me to be there and have that feeling. And now when I talk to him on the phone, I get that feeling all over again. I miss him dearly. Sometimes I think more than I miss my mom or my brother. Now, my step dad, I don't miss him at all. Sometimes I look back, and I don't know how I put up with him so long. He is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. He married my mom when I was 0 years old. I didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. He was just a total control freak. Nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. From getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and I had gotten into a name calling fight. He's a dick, that's all there is to it. I never brought friends over to spend the night; I never wanted any guys to come over to see me. My escape place was at my grandparent's house. I would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. All he would tell me was that I could come up there and live with him any time I wanted to. On weekends I was hardly home, I was usually spending the night at PROPNAME's house, she is my best friend. Now that I'm at college, I don't have to put up with him anymore. I don't plan on coming home anytime soon. My mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. Talking about what comes to mind is difficult. I feel that I have burdened you with all of my family problems. Don't feel sorry for me, I don't. Life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes. 
__label__label1 I just woke up and I'm a little confused as I try to figure out what subject I should be studying and which assignments I should be working on. This is all new to me. High school was nothing like this, never had to study. Now I really know what stress is supposed to feel like. Not that the classes are tough yet. I guess I'm used to being lazy. The food here is getting old and I'm scared of gaining that "freshman 00. " Tonight family is coming in, can't wait, a nice paid for meal. Lately I've been feeling sad. I parted from my 0 best friends a month ago to be here and now I can see how much I really depended on them. My life is so different. I have to try and fit into the friendships that were already made here this summer during provisionals. It's not fun. They're all in the sorority and I'm sick of going out every night. I talked to my best friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME everyday either on the phone or Internet. I don't know what I'd do without AIM. I miss them so much. I'm going home this weekend I need to see some familiar faces. I'm not one to be homesick I just feel I have no sort of comfort zone here even though I should. I mean my brother lives here but has his own life with his job and girlfriend. So I barely get to see him ever. I've been really sad the past 0 weeks. It's just been really hard. My boyfriend of 0 months is in the ORGNAME and lives in 00 Palms, LOCNAME. He doesn't get much time off with his new duties that he was promoted to so he had 00 hours off during Labor Day weekend and drove 0000miles to see me. I can't even believe it still, that 00hour drive had to be horrible. That's what keeps me going everyday. How much I can see by the way he's shown me, how much he cares and loves me that he would come all the way here. He finally bought a cell phone so we could talk easier instead of him waiting in the 0hour phone lines they have at the payphones everyday. He's also getting a job for his days off at a western wear store. He wants more money, he's so responsible, as if being in the marines isn't hard enough work already. Its really expensive with all the gas to drive here all they time and the flights are just crazy. I'm going to try and fly there for his birthday. I know my parents would absolutely kill me. I love him so much and we're of different religions so almost for a year now I've had to deal with my parents. I can't stand it, its drives me crazy inside sometimes how disapproving they are of someone they won't even get to know. It's not fair to me. They should be happy as long as he makes me happy. I would never not be with someone because of a religion that they were born into. Not to mention, the fact that we're both not deeply committed to our religions or were brought up that way. I can feel the tension and hurt coming up in the future. When he gets out we will be very close. He'll go to LOCNAME and we'll be together everyday, hopefully for the rest of our lives. I don't know, its just one more thing added on to my stress factors. Sometimes it's just easier to cry it all out but when I let that happen sometimes it lasts for almost 00 hours straight and I make myself sick. I've been sick all week and I hate it. I should be studying and I can't focus or keep myself to concentrate. I have to learn. I have to stick with it. I've decided I'm not going to go out at night unless it's a big function that I care about. It's not worth it. The party scene is old. I've been coming up to Austin the past 0 years for the big parties, pat O's, LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they just don't do anything for me anymore. I guess that would probably be because I don't drink and I don't' care to "hook up" with anyone so basically since those are the 0 main reasons that those fraternities have parties, they really just don't interest me. I'm personally fine with going to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends and renting a sappy movie and eating a lot of junk food. But that's just me. Something I do love here though is that I don't shower to go to class, don't get dressed up nor have I touched my make up bag since I left home. How fun is that? I love it. I just really don't care. Basically my plan is to try and focus on my studies, I won't have any boys here to distract me cause the only one I love isn't here. I'll do well in school and in the end we'll be able to be together. He has about 0 year and 00months left, but I figure I can make it. I mean he's already been in there for 0yrs and 0months and I've stood by his side the entire time, even before he joined. He means the world to me. I just can't even imagine my life without him and that's why I plan on staying with him. I know people think I'm dumb, that I'm wasting my college years staying committed to a long distance relationship, but I don't know why it would be dumb. As long as I'm happy why should I care right? I don't know, this whole college thing is really going to take some getting used to. I mean, me, doing my own laundry? That's just funny. 
__label__label1 Ever since I came to the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME I have been thinking about playing soccer. I turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. I wanted to come here because I know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. After going to the football game I could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 00,000 people. I can picture myself right now dribbling 0 players and scoring a magnificent goal. Every one around me would be cheering like crazy and I would be the big man on campus. Right now, I am wondering if I have made the right decision whether or not I should have come here. Not only did I do very well in soccer, but I also got very good grades in high school. So, I made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. As of now I am glad with the decision I have made. I am having a blast over here. Especially your class. It is the best. My class consists of about 000 people. That is a huge number. That was the size of my high school class in LOCNAME LOCNAME. In my Psychology class right now I have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom I like. I am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if I kissed her. I am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. I know they must be very lonely. I just hope that their health remains in very good condition. I already told them that they have to live to be at least 00 years old. In high school towards the end I started to slack off. I told my parents that I would get very good grades so I have to study a lot this year. I am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. My sister is going to ORGNAME ORGNAME and is majoring in psychology. If I ever need help or anything I can always call her. She is a junior right now. Ever since I got here, I have been missing my cat very much. I have a picture of him next to my bed so I can see him every now and then. I can't wait to go home for the weekend. THANKS! 
__label__label1 At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, LOCNAME, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows? School is stressful for me. There is so much studying to do and I feel like I have no time to do it. There is time though but I don't like to be alone. And to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. I guess I just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. Hopefully all will work out best. 
__label__label0 Just sitting here and I decided that this would be a good time to write my stream of consciousness. I'm usually tired and don't feel like doing anything, but tonight I have this extra kick of energy (maybe it's the LOCNAME LOCNAME). I've got ORGNAME in the background. I swear all I've been hearing about is the Video Music Awards. Well. they'll finally be coming to TV tomorrow night. We had a hall meeting tonight to talk about the Fire Sprinkler Installation, but we didn't go. We decided to go to the one Thursday night, because my roommate was talking to her boyfriend. I always just sit there and listen to her talk. I wish I could talk to my boyfriend! I haven't talked to him for so long. let's see. since Friday night! I swear our relationship is so strange. We hardly ever get the chance to talk or see each other. I get mad at him during this time because I feel like he's not trying to put anything into the relationship, but the minute I start talking to him I forget about all those feelings. I'm just so happy to hear his voice that I don't care about anything else. He's supposed to be coming to LOCNAME this weekend. I bought him a ticket to the 000 XFest. I haven't even bee able to tell him that he has one because he's never home so that I can call him. Oh well! I'm so excited that I get to see him soon. All of a sudden my thinking process stopped. I don't know what to write. This is how I usually feel when I get a writing assignment. My brain just freezes up. I put it off until l the very last minute. I absolutely dread having to take English next semester. I wish that I had tried a little harder on the AP English exam I took my junior year. I scored a 0 the minimum score you can get is a three to test out of it. I remember sitting in the biology lab room, it stunk like formaldehyde frogs. I have no idea why that's where we took our test. It took so long! On the last essay I wrote one sentence and then gave up. I wasn't thinking that scoring a good grade on this test would save from having to take English in college. Blah! Blah! Blah! I can't stop yawning. My eyes are starting to hurt from this bright computer screen. Ok it's 0:00. I can stop now. 
__label__label1 It is 00:00 in the morning. I had a nine o'clock class and I should still be asleep. PROPNAME should be home soon, I have to remember to tell her that the bank called. I don't think anyone should call before noon. I need to find something to wear tonight I wander if PROPNAME has anything I could borrow. I can't believe I'm still hungry I have been eating so much. I guess this is how people get their freshman fifteen. I wonder why housekeeping is here on Monday. I think that it would be better if they came on Monday every week. I don't really like getting up on the days I have a late class. I wish I knew what was wrong with my computer. I also wish I could fix it by myself. I wonder if PROPNAME is going to call. I hope he had a good Birthday. PROPNAME sounds so far away but it seems like yesterday he was eighteen. I need to do other homework so bad and I need to make my bed and clean up the closet. I'm so glad I got a clean room mate. I don't think I could have lived with another slob. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing I should call her and ask if she misses having her own personal maid. 00:00 ten minutes to go. I'm so tired today. If PROPNAME and PROPNAME come over tonight I'm never going to sleep. I guess sleep isn't that important. I need to talk to mom I wonder if she is still going to LOCNAME LOCNAME? I want to see grandma an Aunt Sylvia but I don't know if I can handle a weekend with mom. I guess I can try to get along with her. I hope we go shopping I really need some winter clothes or I going to shiver my butt off all winter. It is cold in here right now but there is nothing I can do about it. The thing is already turned up as far as it will go I don't think it works. I think they only put the thermostat in each room so you think you have control because it is always cold. If the phone rings one more time I'm going to freak. My phone I so loud you can hear it all the way down the hall. It scares me every time it rings. Halloween will be here soon That and New years are the best holidays. I'm going to have to find a costume. Ok its been twenty minutes I'm going to sleep this was interesting and I don't feel like I wrote enough but these were my thoughts. 
__label__label1 What does the drug ecstasy do to the brain? I have been very curious about this for some time now. Maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug. The reason why I am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it. In fact, in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school, it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic! Several of my friends have done it up to 00 or 00 times already! I haven't tried it since I refuse to do drugs but I'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does. Apparently, when on ecstasy, it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect. LOCNAME is everything and once listening, someone who is rolling (the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking X) can't pull away. Also, they say they feel as if they have "lungs of steel" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they can't stop. Oh, and the mouth chewing. Why does that happen? Their mouths jitter while they're rolling and after the drug wears off, their mouths hurt or feel sore. That's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party. Well, first of all they're sweating profusely and also they're chewing lots and lots of gum! Its crazy actually. I went to a rave with my friends last Saturday. It was at LOCNAME Music LOCNAME. At least 00% of the people attending the rave was rolling on X. Well, essentially, that's what rave's are for. Its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people, the majority of whom is PROPNAME like crazy! Anyway, my friends had a blast there. of course they were rolling. I had fun too, but not nearly as much I imagine! In fact, it was 0:00 in the morning, we had been dancing for at least 0 hours straight, and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired. Doesn't this sound crazy? What does the drug do to people? Have any severe, longlasting consequences been discovered for sure. I've been told several theories, some of which include the brain bleeding, there being permanent damage on the spine, memory loss, and brain cells being killed. Sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with. If it weren't an illegal drug, I'd definitely try it (provided it didn't totally screw me up in the future!) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is. And not just word of mouth. I've seen people on it countless times. They look as if they could die happy right then and there! I don't know if you're planning on discussing anything like this in class but I'm really interested in finding out more about X. Just out of curiosity! Well, I think I'd like to talk about something remotely related. One of the guys whom I'm talking about, in fact, he's in this class with me, is named J. I went to high school with him but we were never friends. We hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally, but we barely even talked to each other. Well he and his friend are living at Towers together and since we're all down here together we've been hanging out a lot. A whole lot, in fact. And I wasn't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave, a lot of people stayed the night at their place, including me, and we kind of "hooked up. " Now, ever since then, we've kind of been messing around well, nothing much. The thing is, we haven't mentioned it to each other at all. We keep doing it but don't discuss it. So I'm not sure what the deal is. I think I like him. well, actually, yes I do like him. The problem is. does he like me? I can't tell either way. I mean, he's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me doesn't mean much. He could hate my guts for all I know and still be doing what he's doing just to get some! That would really suck. And I don't want to ask him because, well for one, I wouldn't know what to say. And for two, I'm scared of the answer. That would just be awful if I spill my guts and he totally cops out. And what's worse is if that happens, not only are we in this class together, but we have to go to the same school for the next four years! What should I do? I don't know. I hope something happens soon that'll figure this out for me well, something GOOD that is! I've written a lot more than twenty minutes so I should probably go now. I guess this wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Whew! 
__label__label1 Well, I'm supposed to write down any and everything I am feeling or thinking right now. The truth is I am totally stressed out today and can't wait to finish this assignment so I can go home and relax and enjoy my wonderful weekend ahead. I have many things to be stressed out about right now. First of school, I'm trying to get my gpa up so I'm having to do just perfect in anything I do for my classes to get into the nursing school. This is my 0th year at ORGNAME and you would think I would have my life together by now. Although it's getting there, slowly but surely. To add to my stressful life is my exboyfriend of 0 years who just moved to LOCNAME so that he can "find himself". Whatever. But it's weird because I feel so much happier now that I am no longer with him. It's kind of like I'm a totally different person. I don't hang out with our usual crowd. It seems that I have changed for the better. Also adding some stress into my life is all my expensive bills I have to pay. Phone, electricity, rent, gas, food, beer, etc. One thing I am so grateful for is my wonderful family. I'm proud to say that my parents did a hell of a job raising my 00 year old sister, my 00 year old brother, and of course me the rookie 00 year old. I am so proud of them and their accomplishments. The reason I say this is because they had me, the first born, at a really young age (high school) and to see how well they are doing, unlike many others who start off on a bad foot. And then of course I have my wonderful grandparents who would do anything for any of their three grandchildren. Especially me since I was the firstborn hahaha! Well, I'm trying to think of what else I can tell you about myself in the remaining 00 minutes of this assignment. I will say that I do enjoy this class very much and want to acknowledge Prof. PROPNAME's excellent teaching skills. He makes the class so interesting you never want to miss his lectures. As a matter of fact, my exboyfriend to this class and he recommended I take it. Well, I have 0 minutes and I'm trying to think of what else I can inform you on about my wonderful life. Well, I'm from LOCNAME, LOCNAME. (pop. 00,000) My family still resides there. It's funny to see my little brother going to the same junior high I did with all the same teachers. And I can't believe my sister is a freshman also. I remember those days. I wish I could go back to when life was so simple. But no, now it's time to grow up and see what God has planned for me. I can't wait. I pray that each day he's by my side and helping me in any and every way possible. Guiding me to tomorrow. Well, I guess my time is up. I think in the past 00 minutes you guys at the psychology dept. can figure out a little about me by what I just wrote. Hopefully the data will be interesting. Thank you once again for your time. Hopefully I have written some interesting thoughts for you and I can't wait to see how my results turn out. Or do I even get to???? 
__label__label0 Wow. I have a lot of books. Ok, it's about 00:00. I tried to start this thing a while ago, around 0, but my girlfriend is over, and I'm helping her learn German. I've had a lot of German classes. Anyway, I'm going to marry her. Sometimes I'm afraid of the commitment, and the choice, but every time I'm with her, she makes me feel confident. When we go play tennis, study (as we are doing right now), or just about anything really. Hmm. PROPNAME got the job at the ORGNAME. I don't know if PROPNAME is just putting on a kind facade or what. SO many guys are like that. Maybe females, but I never really know. But guys are. They are great and pleasant until they're in the company of other men. Wasn't that a movie? In the Company of Men. Yes. Had a yellow and red cover to it, I think. Speaking of which, I need to watch those videos from Vulcan. What a great place. Cheap too. No quite as cheap as my dad's though. I wonder what RPM is going to be like when the evil giant faceless megacorporation finally gets its butt in gear. It seems like I've spent my entire life fighting against corporate america. Fuck Blockbuster, fuck ORGNAME. But now that they have bought out RPM Records. well, I'm glad my dad can retire in ease with all that dough. But I feel like I've betrayed myself. How can I be so gleeful about it? Sure, RPM fought the system, and won. we never went out of business. Several times, the megacorporations had to buy us out, not boot us out. But it's kind of like becoming a traitor for some quick cash. Like PROPNAME. That was one hell of a Judas Kiss. $000,000. Wow. Anyway, I really hope my semester pans out well. I'm really liking the idea of the English Teacher class I'm taking. THe teacher seems friendly. Reminds me a lot of Mrs. PROPNAME. And what luck, a german in there too! Woher aus Deutschland kommst du, mein neue PROPNAME? I think it will be exciting to get to practice my german. THat reminds me, I need to go drop that GER 000 class I'm taking. I don't think I'll really like it. And I can get enough practice helping PROPNAME anyway. I wonder what I should add. So much is riding on these up coming semesters. Did I mention I love my baby? I'm going to propose to her sometime in October. On a hot air balloon, with a large banner on the ground that says, "Will You Marry Me?" I think it will be great. So romantic. Except for the balloon operator. PROPNAME has low self esteem though, at least when it comes to academia. She's so smart, but she just needs to practice. At whatever. SHe's goofy too. So much fun. I'm actually getting a bit tired. I've been writing for about ten minutes now. I think I want another drink. That crangrape juice was good. Hmm. Sleep would be good. Tennis would too. I think I'm too tired for tennis tonight. I may fall asleep during the movie. Studying and writing is tiring. I don't miss home. PROPNAME, that is. Austin is great. So much better than that rotten place. Everyone there, my age at least, had one single goal: undermine everyone else. Ugh. It's been 00 minutes. Bye. 
__label__label0 I completely forgot that I had a discussion group for Philosophy today at 00, so I went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to LOCNAME, one to LOCNAME, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the LOCNAME LOCNAME people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. 
__label__label1 Stream of conscience. Just typing whatever comes to mind. I just woke up a little while ago from an exhausting week of this thing called college. I have made many friends, but still looking for that awesome bond, my best friend PROPNAME and I shared. I am from out of state, so meeting people is a must for me. I meet someone new everyday; it's like a mind game that I play with myself. Can I remember his/her name? What crazy way did I try and remember his/ her name? I do want to go back home this weekend. All my friends that went out of state and those who stayed instate are going back home for Labor Day weekend. When I was small I used to spend this weekend up at our little lake cabin with my grandparents and my dad. My dad would drive up/down from wherever he was on business to take my sister and I up to the lake, for one last weekend full of sunshine and sunscreen. The word Sunscreen reminds me of the beach, LOCNAME trips with my mom and stepdad and of course my wonderful little sister. I remember PROPNAME and I would play PROPNAME in the back seat of the pickup all 00 hours to LOCNAME. Goodness writing from my conscience brings back a lot of memories. I am growing up, that's what everyone says anyway when you go off to school. Here I am its hard to believe that I am fully responsible for all of my actions, I have nightmares about not waking up in time for class or dreaming of scary situations with my friends and family from back home. A couple of "nightmares" I have had have truly disturbed me even after I awoke. So bad that I had to call back to LOCNAME to make sure everyone was okay. Even though I new it was a dream, something inside me made me make sure. Random change of pace, but I am hungry. My favorite thing to eat in the morning is a cinnamon roll, but since I way slept through breakfast this Saturday afternoon, I will have to adjust my system to something much more healthy. My abs hurt when I laugh, they are a constant reminder of my wonderful workout last night. While most everyone was out boozing it up down on 0th street, my friend and I worked out. Seems a little ironic. A little bit of me wonders if I am truly missing anything, just the social aspect of college. I just feel that its okay to do whatever I want, and if I don't feel like getting ready to go out. I shouldn't bother with it, another part of me wonders how can I say no when I never have. I am only seventeen so I use that as an excuse until I turn eighteen at the end of the month, to decide if I want to go out or not. I bought my first football tickets yesterday, the lines weren't all that bad. I just thought this entire drawl process would just be horrible. No big deal. It did make me a little sad/homesick to see all of the groups of friends buying tickets together. Time. Just time and I will also be part of that group. Right? That is what I keep telling my conscience anyway. I am anxious to reread all of these random thoughts from my conscience to see how I jumped from one subject to the next, or even what I did write about. I guess that is your experiment or research on this. I am looking forward to the next class and the research sign ups. 
__label__label0 Well, what to write about? I just got done playing football, we won. I am glad that we won because I really hate to lose. In high school my team went 0 and 0, and that just drove me crazy. As our record got worse my teammates stopped trying, and that killed me inside. I don't know what to really write about, I don't really feel much right now. I guess that means that I am happy with myself. School is cool so far. It is a lot different from high school, because you can't really get to know your teachers and let them help you get through all of your stuff. It sucks that LOCNAME lost. I can't believe that they wasted their season already. I just got back from seeing my sister. She is 0 months pregnant with her first baby. It is a little boy and they are going to call it PROPNAME PROPNAME That is real cool, I really like little babies. I hope that when I have a baby(hopefully not for quite a while) that it is not too fat. That is one of my biggest fears, having fat kids. I guess because I can remember the hell that I put the fat kids through when I was little. I also wish that I could type faster. I have been sitting here for fifteen minutes already and I only have a quarter of a page done. If I was to double space it I guess I would have half a page, but I haven't yet. I wonder if you want it double spaced. I guess I will go ahead and double space it for you. Well that's twenty minutes so I will finish this line and then go take a shower. 
__label__label0 Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Crystal, and I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and PROPNAME got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about PROPNAME and I talked to PROPNAME about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to PROPNAME about Buck. PROPNAME is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. PROPNAME and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in LOCNAME. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $0/hr. That should be 00 times more, but I only work 0 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in LOCNAME. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. PROPNAME, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 00 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. 
__label__label1 My chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. I find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. I have come to the realization that Indian producer people truly are strange. This realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. I mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. The people upstairs just made another random noise. It sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. I'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since I don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. I really don't know what they do upstairs. The people next door to us are just as strange. They screen their phone calls I think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. But then I hear them in their room. Actually, I'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. We've gotten some random phone calls. Some of these calls came from people I know very well and yet I can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. I just realized that I have very random thoughts; I think that this means that I'm not really focused on what I'm doing or something. Actually, I'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. I just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. That is quite sad; generally I always have something that I can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. Yet when I'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. I wonder when I'm going to get rid of my cough. I refuse to take cough syrup because I don't like the taste of it, and so I'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. I don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. Then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. That would most definitely not be a good thing. I guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. At least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. Grape is a good flavor. Chocolate is a good flavor too. I like chocolate. Actually I like all sugar; I think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar I intake daily is what causes my oddness. But sugar is good nevertheless. So is chocolate. I don't think it causes acne. How can something that tastes so good be so bad? Of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, Italian food, etc). Ah well. I never knew twenty minutes could last so long. It's neverending. I feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. There was just another random thud from the people next door. I think they must have dropped something plastic. I just realized that I don't really know any of the people who live around me. I think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. That's kind of sad, considering I hear from everyone that "People who live on the same floor as you become your family" and I don't really seem to sense that. We all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. That, to be honest, is the one thing I didn't like about UT. The fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. Even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. We all have our high school buddies. Well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. If I had counted the number of times I hit the backspace button during this exercise, I think I would come up with this huge number. I never knew I'm so bad at typing; I have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet. 
__label__label1 trying to track how my mind works. I have so many different things going on in my head right now. mainly worries. I have so much to do and it seems like so little time. the scholarship, the basta website, the volunteer tutoring thing. I don't know if I'll be able to finish everything. I feel so drained, so tired. oh well. nothing is as it seems. blah, I feel like I need to just stand in a field and scream at the top of my lungs and let all this worry all this frustration everything that is inside me just come out. maybe then I can relax. I worry too much occupy my mind with so many different things I sometimes feel like my head is going to explode. ay diosito santo que vida. yawn. I feel like I need a vacation. a six month vacation away from everything. no classes, no relationship problems. or I should say breakup. I know that this is part of the problem. I've spent three years with adrian and now from one day to the next he wants things to be over. because he's not sure how he feels. we survived a year in a long distance relationship and now nothing. oh well. not much you can do. I feel sad. lonely overwhelmed at times. but I have good days. days when I feel like I could go on forever just plowing through the week the months the year until I finish my program. then what after that. I feel like I don't have a direction. I have a ba, worked as a teacher in ny for a year, now back in school to finish a certificate program. but then what I want to go to grad school, to law school maybe, but when. what if I don't make it then what. I have no plan. I feel like I just am trying to figure out what I need or want to do. who am I really. what am I going to do. I need a good day of just sleep. that would be really nice right about now. a day of sleep, of rest with no interruptions, no worries just sleeping. I don't even want to dream. just that kind of dead to the world thing. no time though. too much to do too many things going on. deadlines and commitments and work and school and everything in between. gosh I've been rambling, but not saying much really. stream of consciousness assignment. seems forced. are these really my true thoughts or thoughts only in response to an assignment. I think I'm thinking too much. what time is it anyway. time to stop maybe. twenty minutes translates to a good number of thoughts huh. time to go, I've got errands to run. what time is it anyway. good only about thirty seconds left. 
__label__label0 It may be tough to come up with an abundance ORGNAME ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed LOCNAME for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at ORGNAME ORGNAME with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. 
__label__label0 Why do they make us do this? Do they want to figure out what thought leads to the next? Like the autistic people where their thoughts lead them to the next, but only one leads to the next, perhaps a smell or feeling or emotion. I wonder what those people feel. I wonder if they are deprived of some of the things we are. I remember hearing that they can do brilliant things, compose symphonies and paint incredible things, but need help to button their shirt. Wasn't that movie starring PROPNAME PROPNAME who tried to no that wasn't it. I don't remember who starred in it. Maybe it was someone who looked like PROPNAME PROPNAME  didn't we watch that movie in eighth grade? The one about the people who didn't react to normal stimulants? The ones who tossed the ball around from one person to the next, but didn't engage in conversations? Engage that's a good word. My roommates and I were talking about funny words the other day. PROPNAME thought that "fib" was a good word, and there was something else I said by the elevator. It might have been. enthralled, That was it! I remember now. I love great words. If I could have an extensive vocabulary, I think perhaps I would be taken more seriously. There was a cabdriver tonight that knew a lot of big words. I asked him to write one of my papers. What was he doing driving a cab? Can't he find some other occupation that suits him better. Maybe he likes to meet people. Perhaps he finds it interesting to encounter different personalities. Why can't he get a better job? There have to be much better things to do. But what about that movie American Beauty where PROPNAME PROPNAME quit his job and started to flip burgers that was a good movie. Maybe that's what made him happy. To do jobs that don't require a truck load of thought. But then again he found out that his wife was cheating on him. That really sucks. I would never do that kind of thing to my boyfriend. That's downright mean. What kind of girl would do that? There's no way in hell anyone would ever find me doing that and speaking of stupid things, what about suicide? Why do people do that, or rather why would they ever think about it. That is so selfish. If I ever found out my friends were thinking about it I'd beat them into the ground. What would make them think that there is nothing left in the world for them? Do they think no one loves them or cares for them? I just don't get it. What a stupid thing to think or consider. Some people have real problems. I had a conversation like this with my kickboxing instructor one time. It was after the cardio kickboxing class and I was talking with him. I don't know how we got on the subject, but he told me this story about one of the guys that used to go there a first degree black belt and he committed suicide. In fact, I knew the family. The mom actually helped me with this paper I was writing for my really tough English teacher. Little did I know that not only was my English teacher tough, he was brilliant. I have such a great respect for that man. Some day, when I make it big  and the word is "when" because it will happen  I'm going to send him a shit load of money for retirement. I have so many plans for when I get older. I'm going to start a scholarship in my name and all this other grand stuff that I can't think of right now. Oh look at that, the time is up. catch you later. 
__label__label0 I always knew college was about being on your own and being independent. Maybe I have been so busy that I didn't realize I was completely on my own until I got sick. Being sick is just one of those things I have never had to accomplish on my own. I always had my mom to take me to the doctor and even after I could drive, I still loved her company. I also knew that she would get me my medicine and make sure I was taken good care of. Being away from my mom and that comfort zone was not very easy when I became sick. It has definitely shown me that I depend on other people a lot, especially my mom. If there is one thing I am looking forward to about college, it is growing as a person. I hope to become more independent and prepare myself for the future years ahead. I always went away to camp during the summer and spent six weeks in LOCNAME one summer but for some reason, being in college is a much different feeling. I want to be able to do things completely on my own without consulting others, like my parents. I think the greatest thing I need to conquer is decisionmaking. I have always been bad at making up my own mind without asking someone else if I am making the right decision. I hope being in college will teach me to make good decisions and become that independent person I want to become. Already being away from home has taught me so much about myself and how it feels to be distant from that comfort zone. Just like most things, I know it will only take time and patience. 
__label__label0 I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 00. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I hope me three friends from LOCNAME can come visit me. It'll be all of them, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, my mom, and my two sisters. PROPNAME's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. PROPNAME made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with PROPNAME and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 00 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either ORGNAME ORGNAME or the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. PROPNAME is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 0:00. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call PROPNAME by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 0, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like PROPNAME PROPNAME typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. 
__label__label1 Well then where do I begin. Let's see. I need a haircut. I should have gotten one when I went home labor day weekend. But I didn't. I wanted to go home this weekend, really only so I could get a haircut, but I didn't. My hair is getting entirely too long. At least for me it is too long, I mean I don't have a pony tail or anything but still. I forgot to see when I started writing. Oh well I'll just estimate. I really need to get a cell phone. Of course I would turn it off in my psychology class unlike some dumb asses in there. I mean how stupid do you have to be to not check and see if your phone is on even after the professor tells you to make sure they are off. I suppose they might leave it on once or forget they have it in their backpack or perhaps their friend put their phone in their bag and forgot about it, but it can't help but kind of piss you off when a phone rings in class. All I think is, "what a dumb mother fucker. " Hey look, ORGNAME word doesn't recognize the word fucker. Hey it doesn't even recognize the word ORGNAME. My head itches. Because my hair is too long. I need to go to the optometrist and get new contacts. I think I've had these for over a year now. I'll probably get them the same color, aqua. Man it is hot outside, it must be about 00 degrees. Not that I am any good at estimating but hey. Like I can't estimate a girls weight worth a shit. Or a person's age. Of course if a guy is smart, he doesn't try to estimate a girls weight. I need to go to the restroom. My stomach is growling. Man my nose is itching too. I miss PROPNAME. Damn she is beautiful. I wonder if she's thinking about me right now. She is probably in 0th period right now, whatever class that is for her. I wonder if she is pregnant. If she is it's probably mine. Great, just great. I'm fucked. Then again that's what got me in this position in the first place. Speaking of positions, I wish PROPNAME was here now. I want to go home this weekend. Not so I can go home this weekend, but so I can get a haircut and see PROPNAME. I wish I had my car so I could just go wherever I wanted whenever I wanted. Then I would probably be out partying and stuff all the time. 
__label__label1 A fire alarm sounded right before I was going to start this assignment. I had to walk down thirteen flights of stairs. When I got outside we had to walk across the street and stand there waiting for the magical voice to tell us that we can come back inside. Naturally, I had to walk up up up up thirteen flights of stairs. At least I know how to exit if there is a real fire. It also has given me something to write about. I bet that there going to do this crap a couple times each semester. Safety is a good thing. Terrible disasters that can be eliminated with a little planning kill a lot of people. I read that somebody said " a person that will trade freedom for security deserves neither. " I think that it was PROPNAME PROPNAME who said that. I don't liberals because they are not in the business of creating a more free society. They just want to create more of a bureaucracy to ensure more safety. Gun laws are a good example. They think that if guns are illegal, that crime will go down. It sounds like a good idea to a lot of politically correct or pussified people. The real effect from that terrible idea would be less good people with guns and the same number of bad people with guns. The good people can't protect themselves in their own homes from the bad people that can easily get guns. PROPNAME, the constitution guarantees us our right to have guns, probably the only reason why we are still aloud to have them. LOCNAME just passed laws that have allowed the government to confiscate all of its citizens' guns. That would be a nightmare that would not stand for. Sometimes I think stuff this will happen. Other freedoms that people had a hundred years ago, are gone today. My grandchildren and other ancestors might not even live by the same constitution that we live by today in this country. I really want to graduate school so that I can afford to have a lot of kids and still be able to put them through college. I'm the last PROPNAME in my family so I hope my sperm will create a couple of boys with my wife. I wish that sex were not such a strong desire. It kind of gets in the way of being productive. The TVs and ads and the radio just pour on the sex appeal tactic because they know it's such a strong desire and emotion. I saw a cute girl when we had that fire drill. I think she was looking at me too. I should have said something to her. I wish I had more confidence to talk to girls. I wish I could stay drunk or high without the setbacks of puking and slurring words and possibly smelling funny. It's so easy to talk to girls when I'm inebriated. 
__label__label0 I don't like IceBreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. I won a huge pack of IceBreaker's gum from Pro Grad and I now feel obligated to make use of it even though I dislike it. I do that a lot. I eat foods that I don't really like just to make my mom happy. It is not really a big deal. I usually tell people what I like and what I dislike, but sometimes I don't. My grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and I don't like coconut, but I use to eat it anyway. One day I just stopped and she didn't really notice. I was like, "Man I could have stopped a long time ago, but instead I didn't. " Okay that makes no sense, but I do not always make sense. My mind jumps from thing to thing, and I digress a lot. I get off track often. Love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. To me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. I cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. I can get deep and all emotional when I feel the moment calls for it, but right now I am just not really in a "deep" mood. I still have to read my Chemistry and read my Cyberreader for my Cyberpunk class. Why am I taking a Cyberpunk class? I have no idea. I like to try and experience new things so I decided to take it. Actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. Ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. I love to be happy. I hate to be sick. I love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when I am sick. The water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. I don't want to do my reading assignments. I want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. I want to go see "The Cell" with PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I can be such a teenager sometimes. I do some of the most immature and silly things. I can fall all over myself when I see a cute boy band, and I can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. PROPNAME PROPNAME, a country singer, has a song called "Ordinary People". It is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. It talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. The great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. I can't imagine being photographed all the time. I don't look good in photos when I am posing, so you can only imagine how awful I would look in ones where I do not pose. I sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. You all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that I have selfconfidence issues. I can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. I like being short. I like that people view me as cute just because I am short. Being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. I just like the idea of the guy being tall. My boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because I look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason I think that makes us look cuter. Why do they call the prestage room the green room? The green room is often not even green. I don't understand that. I don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. Except of course for in way west LOCNAME where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. I hate people who are hypocrites. I think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. I wish I was smarter. I wish I could sing. that would be a great talent just because I like to sing. Two minutes to go! I can't help but look at the clock. I am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages I have to read. I am very impatient, but I am patient when I feel it is necessary. Times Out! The End! 
__label__label0 Sometimes I like Stream of Conscience writing because when I write fictional or nonfictional stories, that is usually the style of writing I use. I used to write a lot when I was younger and planned on becoming a writer. I stopped at about the 0th grade because that is when I began to focus more on school. I think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades. Those institutions should be places for students to WANT to learn, but now it's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an A in the class. Now that I'm in college, I'm trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes I take, whether they are required or not. I still have no idea what I want to be when I "grow up" besides a movie star. I'm open for all sorts of things. When I applied to ORGNAME ORGNAME I wanted to be a big time advertising CEO, but then I decided that would be selling out too much. Within the last couple of months I thought about dental school and becoming a dentist, but I still don't know. I would really like to be a movie star and I plan to save up money and go to LOCNAME LOCNAME 0 summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs. I know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still don't become famous I haven't even taken a theater arts class since the 0th grade! I don't think taking theater classes do much though, unless one wants to be in theater, but I don't want to stage acting, I want to do films. I think in films to start out with all you need is a little talent (which I think I have) and a good looking face/body (which I am working on. haha) So that's my plan so far. I haven't told really anyone. My best friend thinks that I am going with her to backpack in LOCNAME next summer, but I can't afford it at all. I plan on working at a pool hall next summer so I can make a lot of money and save up for my next years apt. and my famous L. A. trip. I would also like to take a bus to LOCNAME LOCNAME sometime and live independently. My brother PROPNAME did that a few years ago and wrote in a journal the whole time. I would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in a journal. I should probably get a journal now so I can record my little experiences right now, but so far nothing spectacular has happened. I thought that since I'm a freshmen in college I'd be meeting TONS of new people and be going on a billion crazy adventures, but I haven't at all. Most of the people at U. T. are from my high school (I have at least one person from my high school in each class) so it's hard to branch out and meet new people. I've also been stressing over money lately because I have to pay for everything (books, tuition, housing) myself and I haven't had time to think about doing fun stuff. I just got a wristband for the Texas/OU game, I'm not that interested in football though. I like basketball a lot and can't wait until UT basketball season starts though. I would like to make the most of my time in LOCNAME, since it's such a beautiful and fun city, but I don't know when to start. I'm going to LOCNAME this weekend, so maybe next weekend I'll hop on one of the buses and tour the city. Sometimes I like not knowing where I'm going. I just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of LOCNAME away from the campus and the tourist parts. One day my sister and I took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghetto/barrio part of town. It was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus. We saw 0 cute little boys around the ages of 0,00, and 00 and I admired how independent they seemed for such a young age. They got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go, but just decided to go anywhere and I overheard them say "We've got 0 hours, where do y'all want to go?" I think I'm mature compared to my peers at times because I had a dysfunctional family life growing up. Through high school though, we moved into an upper class neighborhood and I attended a very affluent high school which I sometimes felt like a liberal outcast amongst a bunch of conservatives. Some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off. But it's been 00 minutes so I will finish up. This was very cathartic, I should really invest in a journal!

__label__label1 There are some very strange things on TV. I don't watch TV all that often, but when I do it gets stranger and stranger. I love to eat. I eat constantly. Sometimes I wonder what it really is driving me to eat all of the time. Crunch and PROPNAME is the snack of choice for me at the moment. Buttery toffee popcorn with peanuts, it is funny to think why it is so good. But it is intriguing. Why do people change? I often wonder why she did it to me, what did I do to deserve it? I thought she was my friend, but I guess I was wrong. Without trust, friendship means nothing. I often think of this as I look at my relationships with other people, do I really trust them? I wonder why I sit and harass myself with the torture of scrutinizing every aspect of my life. Why do I? I know there is nothing wrong with me, yet I still sit here and ask myself what I could do differently. I need to accept that people do change, including myself. I believe I am addicted to Instant Messaging. It is a remarkable invention. To be able to "talk" instantaneously with my friends all over the country is just unbelievable. I can carrying on a conversation with as many people as I can handle at one time, but usually I just stick to two or three or it becomes too much to handle. I don't even know if this is making any sense, but I don't really care. The thing with instant messaging is that I have an obsession with wondering who is on or who is getting off, I have to check every time I hear the sound of the door opening and closing, even if I have no intention of actually talking to anyone. Why do I play mind games all of the time? I really do. I sit here and plot ways to make him want me or make him think I am mad or happy or whatever. I seriously need to quit eating this crap. It may taste good, but I know it can't be good for me. This is ridiculous, I really do need to stop eating. 
__label__label1 Must I write for 00 minutes? Why? What exactly does writing as I think, called my "stream of consciousness" prove? I suppose magical thoughts that exploit my deepest darkest secrets will arise or something. Of course they could if I really got bored because my mind does jump sporadically from idea to idea but who knows? It never stops and I can never focus on one thing for very long before I get bored. I think I have ADD or something because it is hard for me to focus for extended periods of time which I'm sure if that's a fault of mine or genetic or experience because of TV and how LOCNAMEn society has raised me. LOCNAMEn society is crap. Everyone blames violence on TV as the problem with the current "violent" America. Kids watching violent shows does not make a kid violent. Rather parents not telling their kids that violent shows are fake or parents that are violent or parents that tell kids violence is ok is what makes kids violent. It's stupid to blame entertainment, of course there are some cases where the TV is too blame. We cannot simply say it never does but we also cannot say that it's the root of the problem. The problem is parents and society today. 00 years ago parents would never let kids do the things kids do nowadays. Drugs, alcohol, sex and everything else has become much more liberal. Lets face it, all these things sell and so now we have corporate America where only the strong survive, or get rich, whichever. How the hell can you call this country so great when there jobless, starving and homeless people everyone, including children. Yeah sure for the 00% of people with jobs, even then I'm sure a good % of those people with jobs still struggle to make it. They bust their butts day in and day out to get what they can for themselves and their family yet we're experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in however many years like it matters to those people who are still unemployed or working crappy minimal wage jobs. Yeah, great country America is. I'm listening to this nice piano soloist on cd on my computer as I type for this long 00 minutes and it's quite pleasant. Whenever I listen to this I think about the girl who gave it to me, PROPNAME PROPNAME. Even though she's getting kind of fat, I still find her attractive. It's very unusual for me to find an asian attractive, well at least in the past. I find a lot more attractive here at LOCNAME nowadays because I think I just had a town full of ugly asians or something, who knows eh? Well anyway, I was so "in" to her, never could get her off my mind. I think I have a problem with obsessing over people, well girls, when I like them. I've never had a girlfriend and I've never even had the courage to ask a girl out. I'm so insecure it's not even funny. I wish I could suddenly build up courage and ask a girl out or even get a little kiss or sex or something. I'm no different than any other guy and one good thing is I rarely masturbate so luckily sex doesn't drive my mind and life. I can focus on other things such as watching tv, playing video games and talking to people. I think I want to be a psychologist, the PhD level, so I can do research or get paid lots of money to advise people. People and their pasts interest me a lot, it's freaking amazing what you learn about people when they actually open up to you. You hear about traumatizing experiences and good experiences and stories of best friends and family and deaths and everything else you can imagine. It's all fascinating to me, I love to hear about it and try to piece together how these experiences have made the person the way they are. It's pretty cool to also, for me because I keep being told I'm really easy to talk too. Be it guys or girls, I hear the same thing. So I feel as if I have some sort of gift or something that allows people to talk to me and sometimes that's all a person needs is someone to sit there and listen to another person talk and they will feel so much better. Given I don't know what to say many times but I know how to empathize and sympathize with people because I feel that I've experienced enough pain, hurts, injustices throughout my life so I'm not totally oblivious to everything. I, for the most part, understand that not everything is black and white, there is always a gray area that cannot have a simple answer. There must always be a compromise that comes from both sides or else it will be black and white and life would be boring. Life is boring as it is, why make it more so? A few thrills here and there but life usually is one big long path to death. How you live your life makes who you are and how you are in the end. Is there an end? Well there could be but that depends on what you believe in. Whether it be christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism or any of the ism's, you know where you're going or think you know where your going. So what about atheists?. Well you simply cease to exist. Isn't that a scary thought? You die and that's it, the void. You don't exist anymore. You are no longer conscious and it's like you were never alive. People remember you but you are forgotten once they die unless your a martyr or a hero or king or anything of that sort, but for the most part you are forgotten within 00 generations. And my 00 minutes is up so I'm done. 
__label__label0 Ok, I am starting writing for 00 min. My thought, are what I am writing about. Right now I am still thinking about visiting my friends at LOCNAME this weekend, not sure If I want to do that. I have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what I have to do. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why I am thinking about visiting ORGNAME. I have to be back at 0 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also PROPNAME wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 0,0 in CS, chapter 0 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to ORGNAME tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see PROPNAME and PROPNAME and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with PROPNAME or PROPNAME, most everyone went back to see PROPNAME, I wish I was seeing PROPNAME, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them. Oh well, I can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant ORGNAME on Tuesday, I may go run then work out a while today I want to figure out what I am doing tonight first though. PROPNAME said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. So I am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, I need to work out defiantly this weekend. Hmmm, I wish I could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, PROPNAME keeps asking me to come visit her, which I should do but I am lazy, hah, I have no time for anything anymore, I squeeze in homework and studying, I need to do something about that, I would like to see PROPNAME though, I kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than I thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, I guess I have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl I have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, PROPNAME was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, I need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. I guess I will skip workout today and just go up at about 0:00 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore I thought would be. I just have weekend plans on my mind so I can't think of much else. Psy is fun, I need to be a little less tired Monday so I can enjoy it, I will work on that. Over and out. 
__label__label0 Right now I am a little worried that I am not doing this right because I don't really know what I am suppose to be writing about. Well, I am excited because my best friend, PROPNAME, is going to be in LOCNAME in about two hours. She started school in LOCNAME about two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since then. We are going to the lake tomorrow and Labor Day and I can't wait. I love going to the lake with PROPNAME because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. I am excited about school starting. I have always planned on coming to LOCNAME, but I never thought the day would ever actually come. All my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. I think that I will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester I am going to have to take a nursing 000 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that I have to give. I hate giving speeches. I always think that I'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech I start to shake and sweat. I am getting better at it though. I believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. My freshman year in high school I was terrified of getting up in front of the class. I would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what I was saying. It was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. During my junior year I was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior I played at region band and almost made district. I also performed skits and memorized a Shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. I am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that I don't know very well. It's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that I know well or my family and friends. I just feel like people that I don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. Now I just try to forget about that and try to focus on what I have to say. As a nurse I will have to deal with people a lot. I enjoy talking to people one on one, but I will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so I will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. I hope that by the time I graduate college I will have no problem speaking in front of people and that I might even enjoy it. 
__label__label1 Wow, those life savers look really good. hot pockets remind me of LOCNAME powers that's a funny movie. I can't wait to go home. I miss a bunch of my friends there and homecoming will be a ton of fun. hey that guy was in the wonder years. I wish tatiana and I could talk about serious topics for once all we do is jokingly insult each other. Zoo keepers?? we can't be zoo keepers, we have to be a famous hollywood couple. The retreat this weekend is going to be so fun and then we'll get to watch the football game! I hope I'll be able to get some studying done. I really need to do better in Spanish, I'm not doing too well in there. I wonder how my campers are doing. Two of them are online right now. Lunch should be pretty fun today. I'm glad classes are finally over, for this week at least. That guy looks really funny with that blue towel around his head. Where are all those loud guys in our hallway. Saturday Night Live used to be such a funny showwhat happened to it?? PROPNAME PROPNAME was one of the funniest guys around. PROPNAME PROPNAME was in True Liesthat was a GREAT movie. 
__label__label1 I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 0 or 0 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 0, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 0. Good I have until 0 to study until people come over. 0 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. 
__label__label1 I guess I'll just start out by explaining how I feel right now. Because of school, I've been feeling really stressed. Although because of our class I'm not really sure what stress is. To me stress is when I have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. I feel like my whole life is school right now. I live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. By the time I get to my dorm in between classes I have to leave in 00 minutes to get to another class 00 minutes away. The days have been going by really fast though. I'm always so busy. I try to just get my work done during the week so I can go out on the weekend and have fun. I'm really excited about college because already I've learned so much. I feel like I'm being able to think better about things. Or I guess maybe deeper about things. Not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. I've begun to think more about what I want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. I guess you sort of have to be like that at LOCNAME, because there are so many people. In high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. A lot of the classes push that during the discussion times I guess because the classes are so large. Our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else I talk to have an even smaller class than I did. It's really weird but I keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. I know of 0 people that are in 0 of my classes. Maybe it's just that I recognize them. I still don't really know what to expect from my classes. Most of them seem interesting except for Calculus and Economics. I really like the experiments we do in class. Ugh, I can't think of anything else to write about. I hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. Actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. So I guess it's sort of like a journal. I actually don't feel as stressed now that I've gotten this done. It's one less thing I have to worry about. Now I have to figure out how to copy and paste it. I'm not very good with computers. 
__label__label1 I do not want to draw that apple again. It's so redundant that it completely diminishes the idea of art. I mean, I understand that Professor PROPNAME wanted us to experience the "discipline" aspect of art, but it's really hard to express yourself with a piece of fruit. It's not even like one of those beautiful pieces of fruit you see in most paintings. It's from the LOCNAME LOCNAME, so of course it looks like it's been through hell. I can't believe I paid seventy cents for it. That's relatively cheap, but it's a bruised, disgusting piece of fruit. The food there is expensive compared to the quality of it. Day before yesterday, I paid almost three dollars for a bowl of wilted salad and a glass of tea. Maybe I'm just being cheap, well, actually it's my parents money, so it really doesn't affect me, but still. I need to call my parents. You'd think emailing them everyday and calling them every other day or like every three or four days would be enough. But no, they insist that we talk every day so that my mom can whine about how she really wants me to come back home and go to PROPNAME. I know she's not being serious, they really want me here, but the whining gets really old, really fast. I'm so glad I got away from that area, it's such a hellhole. Everyone knows everyone else's business. I guess that's typical of a small town, but I hate it. Here no one cares who you are. I guess there are good and bad sides of that, but mostly good. My roommate is so loud. She's really nice and all, but she's a little annoying. She's also extremely hypocritical. She claims to be so openminded and liberal, but then I've heard her put down people who are religious, which is really closeminded. I was offended by it, too, I mean she knows that I'm a Christian and she knows that I go to church, which, by most standards is considered "religious". Oh well, I haven't been "preachy" about my views, so I guess I'll just attribute her closemindedness to ignorance. I really want to go to the Counting Crows concert, I'll have to get the tickets soon though. PROPNAME PROPNAME voice is so powerful. Anyone who can evoke so much emotion from listeners using a song, has to be a musical genius. I mean how is it possible that I didn't cry when my parents left me here in a city of a million people, five hundred miles away from home. Yet, I cry when I hear him sing about a lost love. I don't even think it's the words that get me. Well, that could be part of it, but I guess it's the combination of the music and the lyrics and PROPNAME crooning them out. I mean, I could be in a perfectly good mood, and I listen to a song, and halfway through it tears are streaming down my face. And I do this to myself repeatedly. It's almost like a sickness, maybe I have OCD or something. I hardly ever become emotional at movies or other times when the typically "sensitive" girl would cry. Maybe subconsciously I know that I need to cry at certain times, and that's what makes me listen to the music. 
__label__label0 I have been sitting in my room for the past four hours. I am addicted to a video game. I haven't studied. I haven't eaten. I haven't done anything except sit in front of my television screen and focus on my Sega Dreamcast. The game is Virtua Tennis. Along with my roommates, I have begun to form somewhat of an addiction to the game. We play everyday and sometimes we play as late as 0:00 in the morning. We have played all sorts of different players from all over the world and it sometimes takes as long as two hours to beat the harder players. Sometimes, I wish I could just take the game and throw it out the window. It is starting to run my life and it is drawing me away from my studies. Every night when I do get to sleep, I think about tennis over and over again in my head. It is like a disease that is eating away at my mind. I finally drew myself away from the game because I am starting to realize that my classes are important. I am now beginning to focus more on my work. Luckily, I haven't been in school long enough for this game to do anything to my overall effectiveness in any class. I think the main reason I was drawn away from the game is because I, along with my roommates, after hours and hours of playing, finally beat all the levels and achieved every goal we could possibly get out of the game. This video game has turned me into a lazier person than I have ever been and it makes it harder for me to concentrate on my studies. I must get rid of this game before it messes with my academics. Therefore, I am going to the store sometime soon to return the game, or at least exchange it for something much less addicting. By doing this, I feel I can better focus on my class work and devote more time and effort to studying and making a good grade in all of my classes. 
__label__label1 I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, LOCNAME was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. 
__label__label1 Right now I am not stressed and I feel very comfortable. However, I feel like I should be thinking of ways of obtaining a scholarship so I can help my parents out. I guess you can say that I feel kind of guilty. I mean putting two kids through college is no joke. I guess I have been pretty preoccupied with that during my entire stay at UTAustin. Overall I like the campus. Most of the parties and events that I want to attend are off campus, but that does not keep me from having fun. The people are generally nice here. That was really unexpected, because most of the people at my high school usually considered themselves superior to the rest of the people. I wouldn't say that my high school years were the best because it was not. However I think that I could have made it better. However, now that I am in college, I feel that I can start my life all over again. All those mistakes that I made in high school are gone and I can try to learn from them. (Such as waiting until the night before a major exam to study) I think that college will definitely teach me how to balance my time. I am glad that my parents decided not to let me work because I do not know how I could have adjusted. However I know that I will have to work at some time during the school year. Hopefully I will be able to handle it. I am pretty much worried about my classes and what grades I will get in them. So far it has not been so bad. I know that the worst is yet to come. Preparedness is not one of my stronger assets. I tend to be flustered and nervous most of the time. A young woman that I knew from high school told me that the important thing to do in college is not to stress. Hopefully I will live up to that. I can't promise anything. I still feel upset that I did not get any type of scholarship. I felt that I worked hard, but then again there are a lot of intelligent young people on this campus and not all of them obtained scholarships. So in other words, I don't feel as bad as I used to. 
__label__label1 Life, was is it. what can we humans get from it. Is it just something we experience and can't explain? but why do I think of this? no one tells me to do it I just to it. do I feel like I have the answers? maybe, maybe we all have the answer to what bothers us. can we decide when the hurting stops and when our happiness begins. I guess I'm trying to evaluate what is bothering me now. kind of strange, or is it? the think that is bothering me now is that someone else is going to read what I am placing down on this sheet. it doesn't seem fare for me to be doing this when no one else tells me what they think. so I'm giving my 0 cents for nothing, and to no one so I will think about something else. school. kind of fun yet very hard to do. what should I major in? I wanted to do something with math but now that kind of seems hard, money wise. I'm guess I'm just going to go for something that is easy for me to get now. then payback loans and go back for a math degree of some type. what to think of now. students in my classes seem strange this year. heck I seem a little strange this year. I've noticed that I have changed about the aspects of what my university has to offer. I can see why most people come to this school for, and guess what, not for the classes. I remember reading one year in a sociology class that the university can act as a marriage broker. I see this statement "seems" to be true now. is that why I came to this school, probably. I mean I could of stayed in my home town if I wanted just to go to college. would have been cheaper that way. also family had to do with it as well. older brother went here and got a bs in aerospace engineering. could this also explain my interest in the mathematics? and why do I seem to be self evaluating? should I just go with the flow and not worry about the future, past, or even the present? nah, I like to keep my ideas in sort "check. " now I'm remembering what my friend said about the ORGNAME religion and one of the guidelines in it. it basically said that if you get rid of desire, you will feel no pain. kind of an interesting statement. because it shows a whole set of values that you could change, and this would make you happy. now thinking of what my evolutionary biology teach once said. purpose of life is to pass your genes onward, sense genes are immortal. these two statements seem to conflict with each other. that funny. now beginning to think about what time it is. 0:00, only 0 more minutes to go for this rant. well, guess I can explain what I plan to do tomorrow. going to cal class and spark up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex. reasoning being is for "help" on the homework, just needed though. I should just do it and get it over with. that approach never works for me, but never say never right. it should be very simple to do if I get there on time this time. getting a little hungry now, but I will finish this, only have 0 more minutes anyways. damn just remembered an embracing moment in Deutschkurs (German class) freaking had a voice crack, och. hate speaking in front of others, don't know why. draws people to look at me I guess, and I'm not comfortable with that. has to do with a self esteem problem. am working on fixing that by making myself get use to attention. don't know if that is the right thing to do, maybe might learn something about it in this class. (one reason why I took the class, and sure for some people as well ) noticed the brackets I have been putting all over this. seems like my consciousness is explaining something to me. that a interjoke. oh times up. 
__label__label0 I have no idea wher to begin. Im sitting in my dorm and the sound of th a. c. and the fans is driving me crazy. Its like either be hot or be completely annoyed. Besides that, I have twenty different other things on my mind. Am I going to bo to the SI session tonight or am I just going to study so I can go out tonight? Should I even go out tonight? I feel so nervous all the time that Im not using my time wisely. I don't feel at home in this dorm yet so its hard for me to have an organized lifestyle that I am comfortable with. I am so hungry but if I take the time to eat I could be taking time out of other things and I still have another 00 minutes to write so I really can't stop to eat yet. Mainly food is on my mind along with allthe other things I still need to do. It seems like it never ends. Its wierd because when I am studying I feel so enlightened by learning things and I also feel like I am getting a lot accomplished but when I am not studying no matter what the reason, I feel like I am wasting time or getting behind. I wish I could know where I stand compared to the other students as far as knowledge and studying goes. I am so tired and overwhelmed and excited all at once about everything that my mind is going crazy. This whole writing thing is also making me crazy because at times I can't think of what to write and I feel like I have to be constantly writing. Peolpe keep calling my cell phone and I want to answer it but I don't want to loose my train of thought but I guess that doesnt matter because as long as I write what I am thinking its ok but whatever. I keep worrying that the thinking that the things I am writing are making me sound depressed and that along with prof. PROPNAME saying that most college students are depressed really disturbs me because I am not one to be depressed and it doesnt sound very fun. I feel really bad that I am ignoring these phone calls because i always seem to ignore the person who is calling. 
__label__label0      lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 00 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 0. instructor, 0. teachers assistant, 0. myself, 0. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a0 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 0 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 00 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face 
__label__label0 Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea ORGNAME this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in LOCNAME, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in LOCNAME, but had to move here to LOCNAME for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, PROPNAME, is a business major at LOCNAME, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like PROPNAME and PROPNAME, which is pronounced PROPNAME, so that makes 0 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named PROPNAME, whom I have been friends with since 0th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to LOCNAME with him, and his sister PROPNAME, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in LOCNAME at the time, moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME when I was in 0th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 0-0 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 0 business majors, then PROPNAME is a Chemical Engineer also studying at LOCNAME, and he, along with me and PROPNAME, who is 00, are all freshman, and PROPNAME is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 00 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since PROPNAME and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 00 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 00 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say. 
__label__label1 Right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular. I am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting, and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual. I am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts. who knows. I also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i can't figure out why. This is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want, to grab life by the horns so to speak. This is not happening though, and it is kind of scary. Throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities, or a combination of both. It scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done, and have still managed a somewhat successful, although underachieving, life. It makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life. I don't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something, and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else. This not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships. Up to this point I have many friends, but very few whom i can actually call close friends. They are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school. I wasn't popular because of my stunning personality though, but more of what i was;  a basketball player, an intelligent person, and somewhat goodlooking. When i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought. I don't really know who i am and who im not, and i am kind of scared to try to find out. When i finally decide what i am will i like it?  Will anyone else like me?  Will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am. They say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true. You can TRY to be whoever you want but for some reason you cannot always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better. If i try to be a suave cool underpressure type guy, but fall down a lot, it doesn't really fit. I can want to be that way so badly, but it may never come true. If I accept that fact that i am a goofy dork will I like what that will get me. I am going out on a limb here and saying that women aren't exactly falling all over themselves for goofy dorks. At least not ones that i have met just yet. Perhaps this is just society pulling on me, and i should just accept whatever i am. The true question how do you find out who you are?  I want to know so bad that it hurts, but there is not equation to find out. You just have to go out there and do it, and I am too scared to do it. I don't want to end up like the rest of my family, just sitting around waiting, feeling sorry for myself. I feel so much safer and better though when i just stay within myself and don't wander out of my comfort zone. My guess is when you do the wandering is when you find out who you really are. I don't see the oppurtunities yet. I am still waiting and wondering, hoping. I guess if i knew how to talk to people better than it would be easier to find out who i am. When i talk to people though its like they want to get away from me as fast as they can. They look down on me and they don't even know me. I don't understand why this is, but i am afraid that it is because of   who i am  . I think i am doomed to always be this way, and it scares me. I don't want to  be this way. I am too needy for random people to want to be my acquantance, friend, what have you. I expect too much too fast and it scares people fast. People accepted it in the past because they   wanted   to be my friend because of who i was, but alas now that is not the case. So now im stuck, clutching onto the past like a has been with no real hope of ever stretching out and completing myself. Then i will be like the rest 
__label__label0      So I just read the asterix at the bottom of the screen about your social security number and it sounded like the most rediculous thing EVER!  I mean, obviously you don't want you SSN to be taken, but if youre telling PROPNAME you have to speak quietly?!  So no one overhears you?!  What the hell?  I read it out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school, PROPNAME and she said it was probably serious because our freshman English teacher in high school got her social security number stolen. I was sick this morning and I skipped all my classes. I don't know if I should write that because now maybe you think I'm a slacker. But I really felt like complete shit. I did go out last night til like 0,  but I'm really snotty and coughing up phlegm. So last night when I got home, I had to walk home early because PROPNAME felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird. So we came back and I was a little drunk and I called my ex from high school, but he's still my best friend and we talk all the time, PROPNAME. It was so funny, he answered the phone- I was really surprised because he sleeps like a log, but he answered and sounded kind of awake so I asked him if i woke him up and he said no he was about to take a nap though. But I'm sure he was woken up. I really like him and I think I'll probably end up with him someday just because I can't picture ever having a friend I can confide in as much as him and I feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem. But I still get elated when he calls me and I love talking to him most of the time. I'm really excited because tonite I'm going to KA pledge line!  with one of my friends from high school, PROPNAME, a KA pledge. I can't decide if i should wear this black tube dress with a white ribbon on it or this black mock turtleneck dress thats a little bit longer and supertight. Its very flattering, but it seems like guys always like strapless stuff and I have to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and a lot of guys like petite girls. I might go with that one anyway though because I have like a zit on my chest and it shows with the tube one. But I've met PROPNAME PROPNAME a few times and I'm way starstruck with him and want to go on a date with him really bad just so I can say I could kind of, and he's kind of short. But I have a crush on this pothead (of course)  I'm always attracted to that type (except PROPNAME) who's tall and his name is PROPNAME. I may just forget about PROPNAME and go for the tall shoes. haha. So I've only been writing for 00 minutes 00 seconds!  I have so much time left and I already feel like the most shallow girl ever- not to mention slacker for skipping class already. PROPNAME, my suite mate and I are going to go to the ORGNAME later and then-shopping!!  You can never be too sick to shop. So right now I'm undeclared liberal arts and I was thinking about transferring to the business school and then I was like what the hell am I doing because I hate math and economics!  So I dropped economics and added art history which I do like and decided to just stick with calculus-unfortunately. I got a 00 on my calculus homework yesterday. great a C already, that sucks ass. But I'm taking textiles-which sounds like another crap course but I'm really interested in fashion merchandising as a major. I want to be a buyer when I grow up or own a cute little clothes store. I think that would be a blast. But I told my dad I was taking textiles and he laughed his ass off for like 00 minutes and I mentioned fashion merchandising (but not like I was going to do it) and he would absolutely die and disown me if I majored in that. he was like you can still major in English and be a buyer. But I know he's going to tell the whole family I'm taking textiles and theyre all going to laugh at me and think I'm dumb, but whatever. Textiles really is harder than some of my other classes like French (that you would think would be a really hard class). We have to memorize like 000 different kinds of fabrics and their properties. Yikes. So I'm like aching right now and I really think I have LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME's brother's friend (in LOCNAME LOCNAME) had to have his appendix out because they thought it was appendicitis, but he really had LOCNAME LOCNAME. How much does that suck?!  So I like UT ok right now, but from what I've heard everyone saying about the college experience being the best thing ever, I don't know so much right now. I can't imagine ever having friends as close as the ones I had in high school or meeting people as nice as the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. LOCNAME people seem way nicer to me than LOCNAME people. 
__label__label0  Hi, my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am a new student at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I absolutely love it here! It is so much more than I expected. I am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here. I didn't know anyone here when I came so I decided to go through the rush process and go greek. I was very disappointd in the greek system. They are so political here in LOCNAME. I felt like I was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents didn't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush. A lot of the legacy stuff didn't make sense to me. Oh well, I ended up pledging PROPNAME PROPNAME and I absolutely love it !  The sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun!  I have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already. Right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and I am typing this for my new psych class. I am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend. We were together for the past year and I was so in love with him, but he was 00 and I was 00 and that 's not a bad age difference, but he just wanted to party all of the time, which is okay, but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me. That also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so I broke up with him. But I still miss him so much. But moving to LOCNAME is a good thing for me because I am away from everyithing from back home and I can start all over. He wasn't good for me at the time. Hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out, but until then I am not putting up with that and i can do better. I love the new girls in my sorority, they are so sweet!  It made me think of that because  a new friend of mine PROPNAME, knew PROPNAME, my x-boyfriend, and they were friends their senior year. Its knda crazy becasue I am from LOCNAME, an hour north of dallas, she is from LOCNAME, and he is from Prosper. I met PROPNAME at the lake when I was modeling for a swimsuit store. We fell in love and spent the next year together. ANyways, i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me. Everytime I talk to them they arelik how are yoyr grades?  When it has only been 0 weeks and this is like the first assisnment I have turned in. They are so worried that I am just down here partying and not going to class. I don't know why they think that because coming to ORGNAME has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl!  I am so happy here!  My mom got upset with me last night  becasue i told her I was going to the ORGNAME vs. LOCNAME game in LOCNAME LOCNAME and she said no, and I said well I'm old enought to make my own decisions now. Why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun?  And then I was going to eat dinner at 00:00 at night and she flipped out on me because I had class the next day. She is being unreal. And I havne't talked to my dad in over a week because we just argue about how i should be using my time wisely at college. I don't even want to go home and visit anymore. I have always had a good relationship with both of myparents so I don't know why now it is a problem. I love them to death but I just can't talk to them for a couple of days. My roommate is cool, but she sometimes gets on my nerves. She never cleans up after hersolf and she always has one of her two boyfriend over here (that don't know about one another) and she is sleeping with both of them and then asks me to cover for her. but at the same time she is doing their laundry here and being inconsiderate of me. I don;'t know, i'm just really stressed out right now. MY new friends here ar eawesome though. I guess I keep talking about them because this is the first time in 0 years that I havene't had a serious boyfriend. But I like the single life sometimes, I don't have to answer to anybody or call in and check in with anyone anymore. My friends just fight with their boyriends all of the time. I came from a small town where you were able to be involved in everything. I played basketball, ran track, softball, was a cheerleader all thourhg school, did student council, sisters of service, fellowship of christian athletes, and took a few leadership roles and it was great. But a lot of girls hated me for it. I was alway ssweet to everyone but the girls always taked bad about me because I was friends with their boyfriends or was with the guy they wantred. Now that I am in LOCNAME, i don't have to worry about jelaous girls anymore. Which is so awesome. I used to come home from school and cheerleading practice crying because of some of the things the girls would say to me. THey were so hateful and mean. I loved to cheerlead, but half way through my senior year iI quit cheerleadeing because the girls got so bad. It was really messed up. I always argued with our sponsor because she didn't like me and I had no respect for her because she cheated on her husband and slept with the football coach and she was just horrible. And then she tried to date my boyfriend. This was our sponsor, what kind of authority position was she to be in?  Anyways, this is just what all is on my mind . I will make my parents happy and come home with awesome grades this semester abd they will be so proud of me!  That is my main goal in life right now!       
__label__label1      I don't know what to write about right now. I guess i'll start by telling you how I feel right now. I've been a little depressed lately. Complicated stuff with my girlfriend. Well she's not really my girlfriend becuase she said we are only   dating   so it isn't as serious as going out. She's in PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME so she's been really busy with sorority stuff. I guess I just miss spending time with her. I also thought about joining Lamda because I couldn't hang out with her. Now I realize that would be a bad move becuase I need to concentrate on my classes. I am going to make an   A   in all of my classes. I need this 0. 0 to have a better chance getting into the Business school. My sister believes I can do this and I think that if I try really hard I will do it. Wow it's only been three mins and 00 seconds. This is harder than I thought. Hmm I don't know what else to say and I feel obligated to keep typing the entire twenty minutes. I just popped my knuckles and I know i should stop doing that because it's really bad for me. I'll prob end up having arthritis when I get old. I'll talk about my environment now. I'm in my friends room at LOCNAME LOCNAME. Room 000. There are four of them in this room. PROPNAME just said he hates working on Fridays. I would too, if i had a job =P. PROPNAME is sitting beside me and doing stuff on his computer. He said he needs to work on some website this weekend. PROPNAME is eating barbeque he got from Jester City Limits. He said the sauce is kind of spicy. They are watching ORGNAME ORGNAME right now. Now back to ORGNAME and LOCNAME is on. Damn she's hot =). PROPNAME is on his computer messing with some photoshop stuff. I don't know how to use photoshop. I just play games on my computer. Oh yeah, and sometimes do homework on it =P. wowowow, its only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. dang time is going by slowly. haha, now they are watching tennis. ok, nevermind they are just flipping through the channels. It smells really bad now, someone farted =PROPNAME PROPNAME said it wasn't him but i think it was. PROPNAME is getting me to write more. Now he's telling his brother that he was put on the second network. For some reason last night his uploads went crazy, which put him over the bandwidth limit. The second network doesn't seem that bad. All the webpages he went to opened quickly and stuff. PROPNAME needs a new computer. He's singing it to some song on mtv right now.   I need a new computer. mine's a piece of trash. whoaahh   haha weirdo right? =P  uhh ohh now everyone is humming/singing to the song!  oOoOo a girl is coming here right now, because it says on her away message that she is stopping by. dang it now its been 00 minutes 00 seconds. lalalalalala I miss PROPNAME =P this sucks. I was pretty sad last night because i started thinking about her again. Well atleast she goes to the same school. My friend PROPNAME goes here, and his girlfriend PROPNAME goes to . that girl is here now. oh yea jenny goes to UT arlington. PROPNAME smells like girly stuff, she smells good. She said girls fart and go number 0 just like guys. PROPNAME is going to try to transfer to LOCNAME next year. She's been more depressed than i have because she hates it there. She found jizz on her couch at her apartment and she was like what the hezzy. =\ oh yeah i left my phone in someone's car and haven't gott   its evolution baby!   - marco - weirdo. i haven't gotten my phone back yet. I went ALL day yesterday without my phone. I was a new experience.

__label__label1 Somtimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. Why am I falling in love with a guy that I can't be with? I mean, my gah, we're perfect for each other other than the fact that he thinks I'm some sort of deluded tricked person who is believing wrong (referring to my religion). We're both stubborn in the aspect of our beliefs and aren't willing to compromise however there is this unnaturally strong bond, I guess you could say, between us. I don't know what to do. I want to be with him so bad, I really honestly and truly do however I'm afraid of getitng hurt again. Maybe I am delusional, maybe its because I'm afraid I can't get a guy here. Maybe I don't know what I believe or not. I question what I really want and often wonder why I choose to live the way I do. Why do I sacrifice happiness for the sake of morality? Something that would make me happy, why do I avoid it? Because I'm afraid that God will condemn me to hell. Yes, that must be it. I know I'm saved and that I will go to heaven however I feel that other people will condemn me, I will condemn myself and ultimately God will condemn me. Fear of man, fear of myself, fear of God, fear of doing what I want, fear of getting pregnant if I choose to have sex, all of these things cause me inner turmoil. Why be with a guy that's all the way up in LOCNAME LOCNAME and you're down in LOCNAME? I love him, I want to be with him, but I'm denying my inner feelings somehow--I don't know 000% what I feel or how I feel it. . I don't know if I'm creating some sort of mental captivity for myself by not choosing to be with him--am I missing out on the best thing of my life?  He says all the right things, but does he truly mean what he says?  I guess only showing will prove it.   I do like this rose that he gave me. I mounted it on this background thing of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that I made. its a beautiful glass rose, but it broke in the mail. He was upset that it wasn't perfect however me and symbolism, I said it was better that it was broken because things aren't perfect, and even though it will be mended, it won't be perfect. And that's okay. Nothing is perfect. The rose is so beautiful. It offsets the background and the Statue of Liberty infront of it. I love LOCNAME LOCNAME. Do I love this guy because I love LOCNAME LOCNAME so much? Or do I love LOCNAME LOCNAME so much because I love this guy? Who knows? All I know is that its raining here, and I'm sitting alone in my dorm room, cold and alone. surrounded by the mass but alone in spirit. alone in body. alone. I think its stopped raining now, but I'm not sure if it will continue. I have no umbrella. I'm not prepared for the storm. Like life, huh? You can prepare yourself for everything except the most obvious--what happens if it rains? You prepare for the cold, you prepare for the wind, you prepare for the ice. . but the rain comes, and you have nothing. No umbrella, nothing. all you have is what you took with you. . your books, your clothes, your hand, the trees or a overhang of a building.   I came here to LOCNAME not knowing anything. I mean I knew what I've heard but I didn't actually know. I now know, and I don't know what to think. The mass is around me but I'm alone. . alone, cold standing in the rain with no umbrella. dreaming about the distance, and longing for the closeness.   I've thought about becoming a psychologist. . However I don't know if I want to abandon business. I don't know what I want to do really. I mean, I know certain things I like however I don't know what I want to do with what I like. I like many things but I love little. I've always helped people with their problems, listened to their issues, offered my advice when prompted. maybe its time I get paid for it, lol. . I wrote in my notebook about becoming a psychology professor--that way I can interact with students, be in authority and teach about psychology. but I don't know if I want to do that. . Why wouldn't I want to? Money, travelling, I don't know to be honest.   Wow, ten minutes and I've typed a novel. . Omg, I feel for the individual who has to read this, lol. I guess its a curse from typing since like the 0th grade. I think I can get up to like 000 words a minute now. . I was talking to this one guy online however I told him I would   brb in 00  . He has a crush on me. I don't like him. I know its for superficial reasons, but I don't wish to get in an internet relationship, lol. Yeah it would end up being an internet relationship. and I'm not about to go down that road, lol. . The first and ONLY one was this one guy who ended up being a clingy-blood-craving-dog-collar-wearing-submissive ex-goth who liked to bite people. Strange, eh? Weird guys fall for me, lol. One guy. . omg, the state hospital patient--He hit on me while I was volunteering there for bingo, omg. that was scary, haha. Then there was the drunk guy who said I was Miss America 0000--poor kid, lol. . Then, let's see. . the ex goth, the state hospital guy, the drunk dude. Hmm, I know there's more. . Ahh yes, boyfriend number one. The sex-craving chain smoker who was like 0 inches shorter than me. I learned from this guy to ALWAYS tell your mother about your relationships. That stupid dork called my house at midnight and was saying nasty things to my mother thinking it was me, lol. I came home and my door was off the hinges, my tv, stereo and phone were out and she changed the dead bolts on my door. THEN we proceeded to go to the health  clinic where I got the hepatitus A series vaccine (which is good to have anyways lol) and was threatened to get tested for AIDs. It was a traumatic experience, lol. Darn those junior high days lol. .   Well I have less than five minutes left and have managed to go thru most all of my relationships. LoL, wow, the more I remember them, the funnier they get. . my friends think they're hilarious lol. But one thing I've learned--I can't please everyone. I guess I have to live for myself and that's about it. Though I have religion and the morals that   confine   me with that--it should be done out of love. . but right now I don't have love. I want love to give to God, but I'm so caught up in what I want and the inner turmoil that its causing me to just want happiness with this guy, I managed to squeeze out love or desire to grow with God more. . Yes, it hurts to say it, and to acknowledge it. . but hey, I guess its the truth? I guess that's why this was the first assignment--so we can see what we really think and feel. . to write them out and to put them on the table so we can look at what we feel and not deny that we truly did think what we thought. Hmm. two and a half minutes left. .   I think I want to skip class. . lol, I'll go though. . I just hope I don't get rained on. A perfect ending to a perfect essay. . with one exception. Perfection doesn't exist. Morality doesn't want to exist. And I don't know where to find an umbrella.   In the last few seconds or minutes or whatever, my mind wonders to the pasta I had for lunch. NO clue as to why, lol, however I do like pasta. I wonder what I'll have for dinner. Wow, this writing went from super deep to super light, topic wise lol. . Grr, I got the Trojan and Mimic virus on my computer. . another lovely addition to another lovely day. Time is up and I have class to go to. Its been nice writing. . Maybe I'll do this again. . Typing of course--I can type faster than I can handwrite, lol. 0. 0. 0. Times up. . Ohh, I can continue writing. Well, I can't now. I have psychology class. 
__label__label0      Well, ORGNAME seems to be a very confortable place. I like my classes fairly well. Claculus and Physics will probably be the most difficult. Chemistry seems like it will be very easy. . and Psycology. well psycology looks to be very interesting. I talked to my sister last night. She graduated from UT with a degree in psycology. All she told me was,   don't get hooked. we don't need two psycology degrees in the family. and at least someone's got to make the money.   That someone being me. I really love my sister. she is a very unique person. Her life has been a blast. She likes to go places and have fun. . she's got a hugh fun-excited spirit. She's been to LOCNAME LOCNAME. . and now she lives in LOCNAME. I almost went skydiving with her a couple weeks back when I visited, but the weather got real bad the day we were going to jump. I think it will take me a litle while to totally accustom myself to LOCNAME. it's hard leaving the people I love. . my family and my girlfriend. I am in a very serious relationship. We've been together fro almost a year now. . and I think that we're going to make it through all this time apart and end up very happy together. Man this is taking a long time. I miss my brother. He is a marine. He joined the reserves back in January of 0000. last january he got a call saying his unit was being activated and he would have to leave for LOCNAME in two days. So mid january of this year he and one of his good high school friends who just so happened to end up in the same unit drove down to LOCNAME. From LOCNAME they were sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME for some training. they stayed there for a couple weeks, then were sent to the east coast. . somewhere near the cheasapeake bay area and had to go through a few months of training. They did some pretty neat stuff like riot training and stuff like that. he was able to to call us every now and then, and it was good to hear from him. Then after he was done with his training he was finally sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. There he and his unit were stationed for patrol duty. . basically they drive around the outer wall and patrol it. Since he has been there he really hasn't had much time to talk to us. He did take his laptop so he can get on the internet to e-mail, but he isn't given much time to do that. every now and then he gave us a call. He called the day of graduation to see how I was doing. I really wish he could have been there to see me give my speach. It was just not the same without him. He acctually called me here the other day. at about 00:00 at night. so I didn't want to talk long cause it was keeping my roommate up. But He comes home in November. . so it won't be ong before I see himn again. When he gets back my sister is coming down from LOCNAME to pick him up. . then they are coming over to LOCNAME to see me. . and we're all going to go skydiving!  I can't wait. I'm going back home this weekend. I leave tommorow right after my last class. I'll get to LOCNAME around 0:00 in time to see the high school football game. We won state last year. But my girlfriend is in the drill team. . so I'll get to see her perform, I miss her a lot. time is almost over. I've got a little moer homeowrk till I can get to work on a project I've been planning. I'm making my girlfriend a cd. . well actually two cd's. I think she will like them. It felt really good to sleep in a little today. Thursdays are the only day I don't have an 0:00 class!  so I like thursday. well. . time is running down. . only a few seconds left. . so I'll say adeu. . till we meet agian. 
__label__label1      ok here goes i am starting to write for my psych class and i have just switched my roommate. She hated the three of us and i don't really understand as to why. Well, actually i can because we did talk alot of smack about her but we gave her a chance and she never would reciprocate. So my new roommate is in the process of getting situated right now as i type and i wonder what she thinks about me. She seems pretty cool and i hope she is going to be the kind of roommate i was looking for all along. i really miss my boyfriend. He is working and i wonder if he is thinking about me at the same time as i do. i hope he will call soon for i know he will but hopefully not right now because i am in the middle of writing for twenty minutes straight. I just started thinking about how i took a class over the summer on writing. that was weird. anyway, ozzy ozbourne is on his show right now on mtv and i remember how my dad didnt think it was very appropriate that i watch the show when it first came out. That reminds me, i am upset since he doesnt think that it is appropriate for my boyfriend PROPNAME to come and stay with me until he has a place. i went to walmart today and was getting so frustrated with all the mexican people who were crawling all over the place. It was ridiculous. i wonder what my suitemates are laughing about. this sucks having to right this im telling my roomates about this project thing right now. it is for psychology. man my fart smells. i need to take a shower and dump. thanks for getting my new table. umm ya my lava lamp is purple and clear. shutup PROPNAME. hi lerrin. joe is hot says erica. my parents can suck it if he stays. i wonder what they would say if they knew that trey had stayed with us for a week since he cannot find a place in austin. he goes to southwest and i think the people there are incredibly nice, despite what some say. i dread having to read two chapters in chemistry but i know i will do it for i am the determined driven type. the ozzy show cusses more than i do which i think is incredibly weird. i almost threw out arielle's shit today because she made me go through the whole ordeal of moving in again and my mom thought i was pissed at her but i was just upset in general. joe suggested that i throw her shit out in the hall because she was being such a bitch. i wonder if i can cuss on this assignment?  well if not i apologize for my french. some la madeline's sounds really good right about now. i shouldnt be eating so much because you know what they say- freshman fifteen!  erica keeps bothering me about writing this thing i have to fart again. i want to go eat some pringles and ranch dip but then i will feel fat and probably be even more gaseous than already stated. do you ever wonder if people talk technically so they feel smarter as well as to sound smart. why do such people need to feel that way. just go through life doing your own thing and not worry about what others think because in the long run all of that will be forgotten. by lerrin. whats the point becuase the things that matter are all you will remember when you are dying in your bed when you are approximately eighty years old. my biggest fear is that of dying. sometimes i lay at night and wonder what it would feel like not to breathe and that is the scariest thing to me. i hope that i go fast or in my sleep so i don't know that i am consiously dying. did i spell that right?  well im too lazy to go back and change it anyways if it was spelled wrong. i am so happy i finally got my glasses in the mail because my eyes are just dying and i know that i havent been taking good care of them. sometimes i just think that i will get that laser surgery and i use that as my reasoning to my lack of nurture to them now.  I wish my best friend amy would call me. i knew that i would be replaced but i didnt think it would be so soon. i know soccer is a tough schedule at st eds but she doesnt even make an effort to call anymore but i am part to blame as well. im glad no one is instant messaging me right now because that would suck because i wouldnt be able to talk to them. stop interrupting me ashley and stop trying to be cool with kirby because she will figure you out quick and decide if she wants to make you her business. but thanks for running to walmart for me and im sorry i complained all day but its probably because i am on pms time right now. i wonder who is going to read these and what the real purpose is or even if you really do read this. i has made me feel better and calmer that i am typing about what i am feeling and thinking. i am worried about money and my financial situation right now. kirby says we are normal. i think she is really pretty and skinny. i am going to have alot of fun with her. but i hope that i don't get carried away too much because school is my number one priority. i need to get a job and i would be much happier. i don't even have enough for tuition next semester and my parents said they would help but they backed out and i have great resentment for that. i am tempted to ask my older brother but because i am independent i know i will not ask. i hope you enjoyed reading this. 
__label__label0 The clock is ticking and I have to wake up at 0 o clock tomorrow. Lots of white space on the wall and on the screen, purple hat on the side, people walking in the stairs red trees falling off the building. It is difficult to speak continuously, perhaps there should be pauses in between words but then there would be no coherency but then there is no fluctuation in tone and all the mechanics of rules and boundaries rendering the sentences more honest than not. Difficult to type without thinking, every once in a while something pops into my head but prolonged thought disrupts the image and I forget what to say, and the thought of forgetting makes me think more about it, disrupting it further and pushing any sense of coherency into the deepest of abysses. Hunger stirs in my stomach, quiet thoughts in my head about simple things, nostalgia, reminiscing all things past, good and bad, because there can be no good without the bad, the contrast makes all the difference. PROPNAME PROPNAME was an extraoridinary young man as a result of his radioactive bite, I fail to have any of his special abilities, lacking in the radioactive bites. Does this make me less extraoridinary?  Or perhaps I am something of a special person, considering all the different things that happen. Comic book heroes have nothing to do but save and do superpowers and shoot bad guys but in the realm of the real world i am an exemplary everyman with no superpowers making me different than PROPNAME PROPNAME. My computer is overloaded or maybe my mind is going crazy, but this has been an inordinate amount of time.   0 minutes into the assignment, it is difficult to type without stopping the train of thought im currently in. All I can think about at the moment is how different this assignment is compared to anything i have ever done for any class. Flowing and ebbing out of my mind like a loose river flooding the dam, breaking the barrier and drowning out rationality. Confusion and mayhem and all things in my head in disarray, unquestionably noisy because of my roommate, undeniably hot because of centralized air conditioning. Tired of typing, concerned about the method of writing , and if my stream of consciousncess is anything like the professor expects. Should words be spelled correctly?  MAybe I should stop correcting typos and keep typing the letters on the keyboard. People are talking to me but i have managed to tune them out, a song is playing somewhere in the distance, or maybe it is right next to me. at this point it makes no difference. i am confused still, a bit baffled, left in stupor. finding the words to describe anything is tough. i visited home over the weekend and realized i didn't miss it too much. i appreciate my family and love them but the thought of a monthly visit home makes me cringe slightly. the blue cable running from my laptop to the resnet connection is coiled up tight yet loose, symbolic of my thoughts. it looks like its organized, but upon closer inspection there is nothing but chaos. few sockets not plugged in, one surge protector shared with my friend. i don't know what else to say. I have some worries about my future, whether or not I chose the right college, and especially whether or not I will have the courage to switch majors if i realize i am in the wrong one. the finish button stares me in the face, tempting me to hit it before the timer hits 00 minutes. 0 to go, I find that I don't really have a stream of consciousness, instead I have very few thoughts, or perhaps they are buried underneath the noise and nonsense i find myself having to sift through right now. occasionally pausing, because the only word i can think of would be a jumble of letters ars opposed to words that make sense. if everyone is having trouble writing this then im okay, but if i ask my friend tomorrow how she handled this and she says it was fun i will be in trouble. this is incredibly hard. am i tracking my feelings or am i tracking observations?  what is the difference?  philosophy in a 00 minutes stream of consciousness, unabashed, the sentences stopped making sense long ago. 0 minutes give or take. pennebaker is a professor of psychology, enrolled in psy000 i do not know what i should do with 0 minutes of typing. i type faster than i talk. i talk and often my thoughts move faster than my mouth, so that the sounds coming out of my mouth are made up portmanteau words, assemblages like fooding, eated, noteady, meaningless in the end. personally i think that soft drinks taste good, but i can feel them eroding my teeth with intensified sugar collecting around the teeth. science or engineering?  i prefer to do the maths because my memory is not so good. business or engineering?  i am indecisive, hunger in the belly, thirsty all over. shower and swim, run and jog. nothing to study but people seem to be studying frequently. calculus is different than algebra. too many courses in this college. they should combine them all into one super course.     
__label__label0     Its hard to start anywhere I guess I feel like I'm being analyzed   for what I'm writing, but I know that it doesnt mean anything, that   twenty minutes of writing can't really say everything about me. class   somewhat worries me, I know I've taken 0 some odd AP classes yet   i still don't feel like i'm prepared, i just have to stay focused, i hope   that doesnt bother taylor to much but he's just going to have to learn   that it takes me a while to study and that has to come first. Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems. The worst battles are those that come out of ignorance,   and people learn how to float the system of books and test, but it   would be harder to ignore real human interaction, there seems to be   so much misunderstanding in the world simply because people   don't interact and learn who's really out there, so much of humanitys   misery could be qualmed if only people spent time physically   interacting with humanity. Its easier to disregard a text than it is to   disregard a human. but i suppose not very many people see it that   way. I wonder if this is where im supposed to be or if there is some   greater plan out there for me, i wish i knew, but i guess thats life, the   suprise of the future, the unknow of the big picture, everyone goes   through it I suppose i just have to as well. I'm tired of pouring out my   thoughts to a page, i want to talk to people, people who think like   me, i think PROPNAME PROPNAME is the most amazing person ever, her   attitude toward people is superfluous with love. she just is the most   beautifully person inside and out, she is a role model for the way to   look and society and people, i hope to gain a lot of the knowledge   that she has. I'll just keep reading her books, i need to check out the   library and see what else they have, too bad i never have time to   read what i want to and what really enhances my life because im   stuck reading textbooks for hours. I hope i get to join the crew team it   will be really exciting if im actually around athletic people, maybe it   will get me off my butt, lord knows i need to. oh well, 00 minutes   done, gosh that flew by, it was a nice writing assignment, i wish we   could have more like that. This   open your door    thing next week is   going to fabulous im exciting about people stopping by and meeting   everyone on our floor. i swear that the strangest thing, its the second   time I've switched the words our and hour, and not in the same way   either, very odd. tonights going to fun watching the football game, i   hope taylor enjoys himself tonight, it makes me so mad when hes   upset about social surroundings, oh well he'll learn. i guess i have   to get ready soon to go watch the game, i seem to always be   running behind, i'll catch up soon enough, i hope my package from   apple computer comes soon, im excited about my new adaptor silly   really to get excited but what the hey, might as well enjoy life 
__label__label0 Ummm. haven't done this since 0th grade. Thinking always gets ahead of the recording. Allergy's in the air, uncomfortable contacts. PROPNAME's still here, said he was going to the store. Grammar's gotten lax. Cats on the couch. At least they're not playing. Place is messy-I should clean but I probably won't. Twenty minutes is a rather long time. Is that to get to the truer feelings?  After getting too bored for anything else in 00?  I had a feeling that was the purpose of the 0. 0 hour questionaire. I don't know if I spent 0. 0 hours, but it took forever. And I started the questions too late at night. After answering pages of them I didn't want to back out. Have a   ORGNAME ORGNAME   experiment scheduled Friday. I'm peeved that they didn't give you any idea what you were signing up for. Is it necessary not to fill in the participants?  And my vision isn't 00/00. It's not terribly far from, but I hope they don't check and kick me out. I never use this desk (the one at home) and it's filled with papers and trash that isn't mine. I hate stacks of other people's paper. Filled with cryptic scribbles. I don't feel like I can throw it out, but the odds of it being valuable are pretty slim. Strip Tease with PROPNAME PROPNAME is on cable tonight. I've never seen it, but I watch 00 minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off. I'm trying to watch less crap tv, but it seems like that's all there is lately. I wonder when the new season starts?  I should try to watch something other than PROPNAME this year. It's easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials. But if I'm only going to watch one, I guess it should be something other than PROPNAME. My typing has gotten pretty decent. I used to type 00-00 wpm, but typing at work has improved that. Most of my practice though is personal email at work. I waste way too much time online instead of working. It's just so easy with the way my computer faces. I wonder how obvious it is though. I'm rambling, but I feel like I'm suppose to be talking to someone. I say   used   and   supposed  . I'm fairly sure that's wrong (but not sure, which is sad). I always say it, and I can live with that, but I type it too, and can never decide if I should make a change or not. PROPNAME said he was going to the store. I'm paranoid about him reading it for some reason. He just walked up behind me and started to read some, and I asked him not to. It's silly-there's nothing in here that he doesn't already know. And I ramble just like this to him frequently (probably too frequently) and don't have to screen my thoughts much. At least less than with anyone else. But I've always been shy about my writing. I wouldn't even let my parents read the dryest of papers that I wrote, much less one's that were on personal matters. Fish tank in the room, we let moss grow pretty heavily before we bought a cleaning fish. The fish has done a good job though. And it's a good thing we only have neons and guppies, can't kill 'em. Boredom, boredom. Only 0 minutes to go. I wonder how many of these will be read through, and I wonder how many of these wonder how many of these will be read through. Are all people boring like me?  Even witty, entertaining people?  Are there thoughts more exciting?  Does being   on   mean acting like something, not really being one's boring self. Strange itch it my back. I know it's silly, but lately I've felt creaky, like the very mild beginning twinges of getting old. I should excersize. I know I should. I get winded going up a flight of stairs, and I can stand to lost 00 or 00 pounds. I try to diet even though I know the sucess rate from dieting alone (calorie restriction) is dismal. And the PROPNAME's diet thing. Although it evidently works for many people, it's obviously targeted diet in my opinion. That may not be fair, but from my own observations women are much more likely to eat a carbohydrate based diet, while men like to get more calories from meat. PROPNAME calls a carbohydrate diet unnatural and unhealthy. And that's ludicrious. Perhaps his diet is healthy, but it doesn't follow that the other is not. Only five seconds left, does the timer stop by itself?  Went over time, but couldn't resist finishing the sentance. Shave and a hair cut, two bits.        
__label__label0      I'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. I was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best I can do with how ready I am now. It's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, I've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. Habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. You'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. So much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. Only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. That which makes things most apparent is contrast. I could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if I drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then I'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which I don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. PROPNAME's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 0 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from ORGNAME, EGB, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. Even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. With any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. The anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. But what is to name something?  Very far from actually understanding it. So we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. PROPNAME and PROPNAME, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of PROPNAME's law was true. I hope that makes sense to someone besides me. How can anyone ever trust words?  They give us so little to go on. Try describing an experience you had to someone else. They'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. Divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. The impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. I am the universe and I act in the universe. I can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. Let's try some meditation. You hide, they seek. Sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. Instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. This is as true now as it will be now. Hahaha. oops. I don't know what it means. My ass hurts. I should shift or something. That's better. I think I forgot what I was supposed to be thinking about. Don't take points off, please, haha. I still don't know what it means. Any of it. I've done this type of thing before but the time I remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. The goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. Phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one I was handwriting and somehow, I still can't explain it, I just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd 
__label__label0      I was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because I've never really done anything like this. So i decided to put it off until the last minute. It is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. Im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. So far I havent really met any new people that I would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. I think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ORGNAME. It is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. Although I know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. I don't know I guess will just have to see how things turn out. One thing that I am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. In fact she is a mere stones throw away in LLD. She means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. I mentioned LLD well that is a girls dorm, near LLB which is my dorm PROPNAME court that I now call home. Whitis is a nice little community although I don't much enjoy some of the company here. The rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in Jester. However its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. It seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. I guess its just one more thing Ill have to get used to. Not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. I am also planning on joining the ORGNAME ORGNAME and going to the ORGNAME course this summer. It is a big step  in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. My father was a marine and his father was in the army and I feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. One thing that I would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. Me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. It seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. I know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. Hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. He came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. I really do love and care for my family but I believe they think much to the contrary. I guess I don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. This short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much I miss them. 
__label__label1      So, I'm supposed to be wtiting something. hmmm, looks like blank for now. that lady at the library help desk is really talking fast, or maybe i'm. i can't believe my sister didn't call me back, we were supposed to go grocery shopping. i keep hitting the back slash butten and then i have to stop and delete it. la dee da. biology note. now that woman can talk fast. she's just out of school too. and she has a good job. hope i can find a good job once i get out of school, of course that first means that i have to get out of school . when ever that is. nice pants. actually never, i don't really like heather grey. my mom always says that makes me look washed out. whatever that means. blank. another blank. i hope that the timer on this computer doesn't go out berfore the writing assignment timer goes out. writing assignment. library online. i have so much work to do. . wendy's that's sounds goood. i;m wearing a lot of blue. i always wear a lot of blue. . blue pen, blue spiral, blue notepad, blue mouse pad, even the E for internet explorer is blue. too much blue. hmmmmmmmm. keep writing don't stop. this will be jam packed. oh yeah. i wonder what tthis is for too. oops mispelled this. should i go back and change it. ha ha , when i type i saay everything so slowly. at least i haven't mispelled more words. finally got my bracelet back. PROPNAME. that was wierd seeing him again. what was even more wierd was seeing him wearing my bracelet. jerk off. oh, i wonder if it ws okay for me to   say   jerk off in this writing assignment, oh well, too late. finish button. can't wait to click on you. i crack my knuckles a lot. i hope i don't get arthritis. that would be a nice addition to the collection of future annoyances. hey that guy ws kind of cute. never mind! he turned around. mark is cute. yes he is. i wish he would call me back, but he's busy at work. raaaaaaaarrrrr. wait a second. has it been twenty minutes. am i supposed to keep track of the twenty minutes or does the computer automatically cut you off after twenty minutes? it's got to have been more than 00 minutes. at  least. i wonder why he said   set the right key    set the right key to what?  right, right.    
__label__label0      I really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. It's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so I guess there is not much we can do about it. When i listen to music, I like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but I parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. I also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. Music helps me go to sleep also. I can never really fall asleep to it, but I will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. Speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. I've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. Why is that? Usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, I also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. I still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that I know they are ok, makes me feel better. Even if I keep going back to the same part of the dream I try my best to get them out of danger. I have a very strong family background. When I was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect  family and that nothing could ever go wrong. I always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. Their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. One of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. I don't think I could handle my mother calling me a name like that. I think I have a very good relationship with my mother but I know that I don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. I've noticed that I have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. I guess that is because I'm afraid to trust one person so much, but I don't think that is a bad thing. I just think that I'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. I guess that is because in junior high I had a group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what I do. Not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. I've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. I work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me. 
__label__label0      I wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean. What can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes. I'm not a very good typist for one. None too good at spelling either. I hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes. This computer screne is far too birght. i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this. I wish i could read some other students writtings. Maybe i'd find some insight to how i'm doing in this rat race. Maybe i'd figure out what the girls around here are looking for. how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it. I wish i were at the lake right now. no books, no tv, no phone, just a hamock and a cold drink. Maybe a seadoo. A little bit of water sports never hurt anyone. Accept the ones that crash. God i hope  never see anything like that again. Why did that have to happen, all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower. All they had to do was look around for boats. They could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldn't understand that a jet ski isn't a toy. A goddamn toy! how could anyone   play   with their life like that. I hope i go in my sleep. i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now. those poor bastards. i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though. i could never live with that kind of baggage. they didn't even know where their parents were. for the love of God, what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call.   MRs smith, your daughters are dead. There was nothing we could do, i guess these things just happen.   and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek. Maybe i am ill. maybe i should get a bike. I could get around alot faster. Maybe i should just leave early, then maybe i could loose some weight. mayeb i've got it all wrong though. maybe they don't even care about that. I should loose some weight anyway. its unhealthy. Who ever reads this thinks i'm a nutcase.  Hello out there. welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind. its cold in here, but you'll get used to it. watch your step, there are some loose screws here and there. don't poke at that, i'm affraid it might fall apart. don't trip on that, its allready fallen apart. i know its messy in here but i'll get it all organized sooner or later.   i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady. I hear they are very affordable. I guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole immigration mess. maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess, or our terrorism mess. or our youth mess. or our drug mess. who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are. i'll just let trusty george W. handle it. err, imean cheany  
__label__label0      So I started my college life about two weeks ago. It has all gone pretty much as to what I had expected it to be like. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME which is an off campus dorm and I have met tons of new people. I live with four girls whom I didnt know when I first started school. Some older people at the ORGNAME set us up. I really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. We get to experience our new life together. We get along great and do everything together. I am also really enjoying the fact that I get to make all my decisions on my own. Not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. I mean I don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work I have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. I have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. I have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. With homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. My roomate and I have had grown very close over the past two weeks. We have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. We realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. I feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. We both experienced ORGNAME ORGNAME together. We both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. We accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. I feel at home whenever I am at the house. Each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 00 of the new pledges. I am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. Other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. I am taking 0 classes which comes out to 00 hours. I chose the classes that I wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. The work load started off fine and I think that I am going to be able to handle everything. I was a little nervous at first about the large classes because I came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 00-00 people. My classes at LOCNAME on the other hand were quite large. I didnt know if I was going to be able to concentrate during a lecture if there were on average 000-000 people in the classes. As soon as one day passed I knew it wouldnt be a problem as long as I got to class early so that I would have a decent seat and be able to listen as closly as I could. As these last two weeks have flown by I have realized differnt tecniques to make the rest of my experiences at LOCNAME even better. I have learned from my mistakes and I have gained from my experiences.                       
__label__label0  How necessary is sleep? The past few days, I have been going to morning swim practice and then my 0 A. M. classes. Is only four to five hours enough? I know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. But is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. Right now I am feeling somewhat tired, but know that I have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. Will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will I get use to this kind of sleep cycle.      Also I wonder if I am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. Are my notes as good as they should be or should I be taking more during class? I write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do I need more details in order to do well.      The past few days I have recieved two different parking tickets, that I thought were unnecessary. I double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. The signs indicated that I wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if I could find a spot. But after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, I guess I now have to pick a different location. I wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. I wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. The front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. This is mainly because of the lack of evidence that I have, which I think is incredibly stupid.    
__label__label1      What to write about? I don't really know. Should I talk about my fears of not successeding in life. Of my fears of never finding the true some one. Or maybe about the sadness I feel when I think about my past four years in highschool. The friendships I made and my heart that got broken more than once. Or should I talk about my family. One of my little brothers that we have a connection that is so strong I miss him very much. Or maybe I should talk about the hopes of a good year. Or maybe I should just concentrate on my work here and forget about the emotional stuff, maybe that will help. I came here for a reason, to kae something out of myself and make alot of money because of it. I also came to prvoe and show off to people that I am some body. I don;'t really know what to say. My head keeps going back to the first person I let in my heart that ended up breaking it. Why I don't know I got over him but when you hear that he has a new girlfriend it just hurts. But then I think I must lose weight so when I go back I can make him regret it. But what do I care he is not even thinking about the future. I want to have a good job with alot of money, with a loving and faithful husband, and two great sons. I guess I want boys becasue I really never got along with any girls. Me and my sister really don't have that close of bond becasue she betrade my trust and I don't really know if we can ever have the same bond. However, I I do have a great connection with my cousin who is a sophmore in highschool she knows everything about, just like my mom. My mom knows everything about me too. People think that it is weird that I tell her everything, but I don't. I can't tell my father everything because he has this vision of me that I never ever want to disappoint him. He sees me as this smart girl who can do anything. I don't see it. I believe that I can make anything out of myself, but I don't know if I can actually do it. Is it going to be to hard? I really can't tell. My dad says he will love me even if I don't make it but he says it is nonsense to think that I won't I have to prove this to myself and family and my so called friends that I left behind. None of them have really kept that much in touch only like 0 or three. Am I being selfish to think that my friends can't even email me. But I am glad I left. Most of my friend were under class men in highschool becuase  the senior   friends   that I had were never really my friends I just hanged out with them once in a while and when ever i did I felt like such an outcast. I sometimes feel like that once in a while. But I guess everyone feels out of place once in their life. I think I just have to let go of my past and MOVE on. I have to start my life here make new friends. I haven't even made one yet. I have to break out of my quiet shell and just take the risk and try to meet people. This is my time to live on my own on my rules, I justgot to wake up and do it. I have to focus on all my goals and then just do it and after I do this I should look at the end of the tunnel and see my future the things I am destined to do. Hopefully they will be great and my life will have happiness and success. Now if my roomate will stop talking to me i could write more. Mut time is ending and I must leave now.

__label__label1 Well to me PROPNAME will be writting for a solid twenty minutews so I guess I will talk about a very cool event that has just befallen me in the past few day. Early this summer I recived the new student directory, a directory that shows the pictures and intresets of the new incomming class. Well, when I first got the directory my sister who is nine looked at it first. When I finally got a chance to see it I noticed my sister had left me a note that said,    Girl you are going to marry page 00 nPROPNAMEed PROPNAME PROPNAME.  I looked att the picture of the girl smiled at my sisters innocent joy and put the dirctory on my shelf, and thought nothing more of the girl. THen on Wendsday of this past week I see this knock out walking down the escaltor. I was walking with some friends and in an effort to get a better look at this beautiful girl I told my friends to go ahead. So I tried to make myself, not that anyone noticed. ok pause I have killed like five ants while I have been writign this thing. any way I tried to make myself look like I was doing something until she neard the door. I then reached out and conviently opened the door for her. She said,    Thank you,   and nothing more but I felt great! Well as I wathced her walk away I felt something in my gut tell me to go up and say hi or something of that nature. Well, I am fairly confident person and I have been known on occasion to go tell girls I thought were very pretty, just that, that they were pretty. I don't really know why I say these things sometimes it just makes me feel better that I told them they are pretty. Ok number six just got it. Ok so I have this gut feeling to go up and tell her I think she is beautiful. So I run up to where she is walking,and I kind of get infront of her and say,   PROPNAME, I just wanted to tell you I think you are really pretty. Thats all thats all I wanted to tell you.  She says thank you and kind of smiles. It must be wierd for her to have some random guy just come up and tell her that, but I just kind of needed to. Well now for the cool as heck part. I reach out my hand to introduce myself,   Hi my name is PROPNAME,   and She says   Hi I am PROPNAME.    What is your last name?   I asked and she says   PROPNAME.  Well at this point I don't know if you can scroll back up to the begining of my story but, this is the same girl my nine year old sister picked out for me to marry! I couldn't believe it! Our conversation kind of ended there I said I would see her arounf and she said good bye. . I am almost out of time but I ended up talking to her on Friday and we are going to go out sometime this week. I couldn't believe how strange this whole thing played out but, I know I have prayed about it and I am just going to keep trying find teh right path and who knows, it might be something amazing.         
__label__label0 I am sitting in my dorm room right now and I just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because I don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on TV. I was so stressed out earlier today because I can not hack it in my calc. class. I went to class though only to affirm what I had previously believed. YEAH RIGHT. I used to think I was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that I am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. Simply for the fact that math is required. I am actually happier though because now I have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. I like that. I like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. I am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. I also added RTF 000 to my schedule. I am so excited for it. People annoy the crap out of me. Sometimes I wish I could just crawl into a box and never come out. Call me a crab but I don't really care. I am what I am. I feel chubby right now. I want to eat but then I don't. I know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when I don't truly want it. Wasters never want. . . good quote. Very true. I have come so far in my life. I can't believe I am finally at college. . on my own. There are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways I am lucky. It is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. That is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. Falling short of the glory of God. It is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. I lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and I also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! I will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. I can't believe I used to sell knives this summer. Seems like 0 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. One day, I hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. I would pay good money for that. I am sure every woman in the U. S. would do the same. I bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. I tan too often but I do like the feeling and I am not going to stop. 
__label__label1      So today has completed a very odd and trying week. I have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and WOW!!! I seem to find myself asking, have I over done myself? I am taking 00 hours of scool and working 00-00 hours a week and on top of all this I got TWO kittens that require a lot of attention. This, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work I have to make sure I am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but I love them. My roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like I am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? I am not trying to say I don't take their words into consideration but I believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he/she learns. This is a test for me that I hope I don't fail at but all I keep telling myself is that I must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). I am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. She found out a month ago that she had 0rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. The doctor said she should be alright but I still worry. I really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. All I can conclude is that I have been set a full plate that I now must eat. Besides all the drama I just mentioned I have finnaly declared my major as Child Development/ Pre-Med with a minor in psychology. THis is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which I am very thankful for. I know it will be A LOT of work but I love working with children, but now whether I follow all the way through with Pre- Med is a different story but I know eventually I will get through it and go to Med-School. For right now I need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. Another thing I am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that I could have gotten two tickets the the OU game and I passed up the opportunity. There goes a couple hundred dollars I coould have gotten off ebay. Oh well, that's the way life goes. By the way, my boyfriend of three years, PROPNAME, Took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. We had 00 courses in 0 0/0 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(0 bottles of champaign ahd 00 glasses of assorted wine later). The cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $00 =). Anyhoot I enjoyed writting and I will see you next time, bye.   
__label__label0      I'm just sitting here in my dorm room wondering what exactly i'm supposed to do on this assignment. Will the professor scold me for writing the incorrect responses?  I'm not sure. I can hear 0 things right now. One in my air conditioner. It sounds like a small, fast moving fan. A fast moving fan that doesn't seem to cool the room at all. I can also hear the neighbors' music through the wall. Now that I think of it, i can hear the soft hum of my computer as well. I'm looking at an award that's hanging on my wall I earned playing tennis for my high school. Now i'm thinking about my high school friends. Steph, PROPNAME, Ki, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME were my closest friends. I miss them but I'm so excited about my new life. PROPNAME was my good friend in high school too, but I guess i didn't include him in that list because he's my roomate. I was going to try and not mention PROPNAME, but that's really who I'm thinking about. I met PROPNAME at LOCNAME LOCNAME about a week before school. She's a really wonderful person that I'm very attracted too. I'm looking at a PROPNAME PROPNAME pez dispencer that she gave to me yesterday. Now I'm staring into my computer with because it has a large plexiglass window on the side. It's quite distracting, really. A jumble of customly installed wires is to me something like a low rider car to another person. Now i see a router that I'm going to use to hook up our network when we get road runner installed in our dorm room. I took 0 years of networking class in high school, and after the first sememster i was convinced that was what i wanted to spend my life doing. However, I recently decided that networking wasn't my true aspiration so I don't really know what I want to do specifically. I'm told that's okay and i will figure it out soon enough, and i beleive it. I think I'm getting kind of sick so i took some medicine earlier and have a bad taste in my mouth from the medicine. Now i'm thinking I should go work out tomorrow at PROPNAME. My friend told me that there's another good gym near PROPNAME but there aren't as many girls there. Now I'm wondering what i'm going to write about for my last 00 minutes, I really have no clue. I could explain how I put my computer together, or what each part does. I could talk about my high school tennis experiences, about my family, or about my high school hobbies. My roomate has arrived and i greeted him, he went to his bed and is watching TV, some sort of sports I'm sure. We went to the football game last Saturday. ORGNAME won 00-0. LOCNAME scored all 00 points in the first half, so the second half was pretty boring. It was still better than I expected for my first college football game. I really want to go see the OU game this year, but tickets are a hot commodity. After this assignment, I'm going to try to do some Economics, and maybe Calculus. This class, Psychology, is the class I'm most worried about this semester. I took Calculus in high school and I think with a little studying I'll be able to make a B in it. I don't know why but I have a great understanding for Economics so I don't think that class will be incredibly hard either. My communications teacher said that her class would be hard, but I think I'm better at communications that Psychology. I also have BA 000 and a Freshman Interest group class but those are pretty much participation grades, so a little time a effort will ensure an A. My schedule is incredible. None of my classes start before 00, and I have Friday's off from school. I find upperclassmen drooling over this schedule, so to find it as a freshman is pretty incredible, I think. As my time winds down I wonder what exactly this class has in store for me. Even college. Heck, even life. I wonder what big decisions I will make, what lucky breaks I will get, what major crises i will encounter, and what disadvantages I will overcome. All I can do is wish myself and my fellow peers luck and great success to find what we truly desire. 
__label__label1      I am wondering how I am going to type because I do not type very well. I also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write/type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know?   today was the yr anniv of 0/00, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 00 as 0-0-0. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there.    i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her  we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves)  like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!!   i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing.  i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it?  i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so I always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i?   well i have about 0 min left, it wasn't that painful   i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 00 mins went by really quickly 00, 0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0 yea!!!!!  its over!  not bad, eh?  enjoy   
__label__label1      Hi, my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. I am 00 years old. I am Catholic, I   like to play the piano, I miss my family, I miss my friends. I do have   alot of friends that came to ORGNAME with me, but I didn't really hang out with   them much in high school because I had a boyfriend and seemed to live a   totally different life than they did. They were on the debate team, I was   on the dance team, I joined every organization there was in high school   because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great.  All my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten   percent of the class. My cell phone is ringing now. I really want to pick   it up, but I think it's just my cousin so I'll leave it alone. It kind of   gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my   room number when I told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's   long distance. I still have the same number from back home, so my mom can   call for free. I had a bad dream the other night about my mom. I dreamt   that she had done something really sweet for me,  and I didn't appreciate   it. All I could think about was being with my friends. When I came to   orientation this summer, I hated it! I called my mom every 00 minutes   telling her that I would rather go to ORGNAME ORGNAME or ORGNAME ORGNAME, the   community college in my hometown. But now that I'm here, I really like it.  I don't miss her as much as I thought I would. I really miss my   exboyfriend. I think I disliked orientation so much because we had just   broken up. We had gone out all through high school, and he's at ORGNAME now.  That's where I really wanted to go. I got in, and into the business school   too, but I really wanted to be in the honors program. I guess I was a   little conceited and believed that I was smarter than the average student   at ORGNAME. Anyway, I had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, I   waited and waited. I received my letter from UT but it didn't mean   anything to me, because I didn't know anything about this college, none of   my friends were going here, and Kit wouldn't be here. But my parents gave   me a deadline and said I had to decide on a college by March 00 or   something. So, I decided to come here. I think mostly because I was upset   that Tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and I also   thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make   it, surely Kit and I can. Well, prom rolled around about 0 to 0 weeks   later, and Kit made prom court. We were both amazed. Because he made   court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and   tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky   football player. So the day of prom rolls around, and Kit callls about 0   to say that the court got a limo. I thought   Great, now we don't have to   worry about transportation!   But then he said there wouldn't be enough   room for the dates, just the court. So I asked him, am I suppossed to go   to prom alone? And he told me to have my parents drive me! I was so upset   becuase later on I found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or   not, and Kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. I   don't know if I'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel.  Everytime I think of my prom, I'll always remember that. He also said   during prom , that I had been acting weird ever since I choose UT. That   made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had   always said, do what's best for you. I didn't know that he thought what   was best for me was him, and not a better education. I miss him so much. I   tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but   everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. That it would be too   hard to have a long distance relationship. I'm really disappointed in him,   this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that I dispise them, and   right before he left for Tech he didn't tell me about it. A week later, I   ran into his parents at Best Buy and his mother told me. Each time he does   something like this I vow this is the last time, I'm through with him, but   I keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and I fall in   love with his memory all over again. I wonder if he's dating anyone yet. I   d 
__label__label0      well here i am, just sitting and typing. I've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - I've got class til 0, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week!  hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me?  thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 0 (or 0?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 00 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big L-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that PROPNAME (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong!  maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that I've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 0) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 0) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 0 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 0) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 0 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she HAS her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows!  im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never

ok. BYE!!!!!!!!!! 
__label__label0      Hi, well. I'll start out by introducing myself. My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. I am a Freshman here at The ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Just recently i got off the phone with my girlfriend. aahhh. i love her soo much. We have been together for 0 years and 0 months already. Except, just two nights ago we had a little argument, or should I say   miscommunication  . She told me some things that I really didn't enjoy hearing, and of course, I got upset. and reacted. At that point I didn't really feel like talking to her the rest of the night, or even the next day. But I fell asleep thinking about it. Which wasn't really smart because it made me even more mad. So, that morning I woke up at 0:00 AM to go to my first class. It was one of my farthest classes, so of course I had more time to think. After that class, I came home and wrote her an e-mail. I was so confused and I had so many mixed feelings towards her. I wasn't sure what was going on. Just that I loved her and that I still wanted to be with her. Well, needless to say, we talked about it afterwards. and of course, we're still together. THANK GOD!!  :)  So everything is going really well right now. And I'm glad because we don't live in the same city either, so its not that easy. I come here to ORGNAME and she goes to ORGNAME in College Station. And I have to admit, long distance relationships suck, but when it comes down to those one or two or three weekends out of the month that you get to see each other, they're great!  And I guess that's it for that subject. Right now I'm watching Shop Til You Drop. I remember watching this show and Supermarket Sweet a really long time ago. So, they're probably all reruns. Right after I get through with this I am going to go downstairs and have dinner. I'm pretty hungry even though I just had a couple of snacks up here in my dorm. I live at The Castilian. It is really a neat place. And it is a convenient location for me because my classes don't seem to be so far. My parents didn't let me bring my car over here to LOCNAME my first year. I was pretty bummed out about that, but I wouldn't have used it to drive to school anyway. It would be parked here in the Castilian's garage, which by the way, costs $000 for the two semesters. Although, it would come a lot in handy on the weekends when I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends, or to go and visit my girlfriend in College Station. Speaking of which, I saw her this past weekend. (labor day weekend). Me and a friend of mine left here on Saturday morning, it took us about an hour and a half to get there, and then we drove back and partied here. It was a blast!  Although my girlfriend got a little carried away drinking and ended up throwing up for some of the night. But it was ok because she was really fun before we went to bed. We also tried going to a club called BOYZ CELLAR, but my friend (PROPNAME), the one who picked me up, is 00. So they didn't let her in because you have to be 00, so of course, none of us went in. That pretty much sucked because I was really looking forward to that. I guess we'll just wait for another good weekend and we'll all go because her birthday just so happens to be about two weeks from now. And now about school. Let me tell you, the classes here at LOCNAME are not going to be anything easy, thats for sure. I am taking 0 classes (00 hours). I am trying to major in Biology, but. my strong point is absolutely not Biology. And thats because this semester I am taking Biology 000, Biology 000, Chemistry 000, Calculus 000K, Cardiovascular and weight training, and of course, Psychology with you. So, I'm looking forward to a pretty tough semester. I just know that I have to study a lot and listen in class and take good notes and hopefully everything will go my way. I don't really want to start off bad because it is not a good impression on the professors or anybody who is looking for someone to fill a job opening. My goals for the future would have to be that I want to live with my girlfriend, somewhere VERY NICE. And I want to be someone that makes pretty good money. And I want to have a couple of pets. Not too many. And I know that my girlfriend wants A LOT. she probably has been planning some part of her future in her mind. Like, at least what kind of house she wants, or something of that sort. I mean, she already has the exact ring that she wants when she gets married. She wants it to be white gold, with a big   ROCK   on it. Sounds pretty simple, doesn't it?!  :)  So yeah. and. well, I think my parents are going to come up and visit soon. I really didn't want them to come up here, I'd rather go down there. because I think that maybe I would feel awkward having my entire family in my dorm for a while. And then hanging out with them here on the weekend. I think I would be too tempted to just be like, ok. well, I'll see you tomorrow afternoon, and go out to a club or something. But, well. that's all for now. I can't really think of anything else to type. My mind has totally gone blank. I have typed everything that I am thinking and maybe even EVERYTHING that I have thought about the entire day. Well maybe a few exceptions. And the time and minutes on top don't seem to be moving at all. I don't know exactly how much time I have left to type. But the twenty minutes have seemed to go by pretty fast.       
__label__label1      Ok. . i;m sitting in this computer lab of this co-op I'm supposed to like and really bond with. Unfornuately, I don't like the people very much,it smells, and the kitchen always wreeks of too much garlic (like a disgusting amount. )  Oh well. But I really like this keyboard. I think typing on a good keyboard is very important. It can really effect your typing and writing experience. It also has this great squishy thing for my wrists to sit on. All I want to do is pinch it all day. But there are other things I have to do. :)  ok. what next. well some say I'm very neurotic, but my boyfriend was supposed to call around noon and I've called 0 times already and he hasn't picked up the phone. It kind of worries me when he's that late at returning my phone calls. THEN I think about this really great hair iron I just got a week ago and how wonderful it is. It's so wierd that something could make your hair look so healthy when it is actually so damaging for your hair. Get this. it get's so hot, that i've had serious burns on my hands from just barely touching it. They don't like to sell this iron to regular consumers (I guess I know why) but I got a special hook up. Now here's where I get neurotic. I'm really scared that I DIDN'T turn off the iron this morning before I left and I wanted to tell PROPNAME to check when he wakes up. BUT what if he hasn't woken up because the whole upstairs is on fire and he's lying there unconscious or even dead?????  See what I mean?  I'm a huge worrier. Sometimes I feel that I could strech my brain so far that I could litterly make myself crazy with worry. Well, my feeling is. what if it were actually true?  you know, bad things have to happen to sombody. Why does everyone think they won't happen to THEM????  Well, technically, If I were to leave the iron on, it would probably just deconstruct itself and melt the plastic tub underneath it. But it could get hot enough to start a fire, I guess. you never know. Well now I'm getting hungry and I'm trying to decide how to spend my time before going to Psychology at 0:00. I have to put a note on this girl's door so she can help me find a replacement so I can get out of the god-awful place and then I have to check my labor assignments and then I have to check the phone book for the nearest cell phone provider so I can get a phone charger replacement. Whew!!!  quite a day. Oh, and I have to cancel an appointment with my dad because I just want to spend a few hours with my boyfriend. It that so wrong!!!!????  I saw my Dad for 0 hours yesterday and he still wants more time the following day!!!  Sometimes people just drive my crazy. 
__label__label1      oops i don't know what i just did. But back to that, i always feel bad for the customers because who wants a server thats all sweaty? I would be so Thank god Alright im not really sure what to do now. I just typed for a complete 00 mins then the side of my hand hit return. Soooo i guess i'll type for ANOTHER 00 mins to make sure i get the credit. Im not an overachiever either, but i might as well just type. We're going to light some candles in our room now. My roommate just said our room smells like shoes. . mmmmmmmm. Luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh(er). Thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty! Alright i feel a headache coming. I think because im hungry. I ate, what. maybe 0 or 0 0/0 hours ago?? aaaaah im hungry!!! Morning seems so far away. Alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again. thanks!!!! yes i am frustrated. stupid hand!! its because i type fast and don't pay attention to what im hitting so much. I just get sooo into this, haha. hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine. oh well mine looks prettier. Ok  i need a date book. I just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go. I want one of our good friends from LOCNAME to come in hte weekend of the ORGNAME game. that would be fun for him. But problem. I think thats the day after Thanksgiving. The morning after actually. Shit. My friend PROPNAME will be in LOCNAME until Saturday, and I know im going to LOCNAME. . But i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all. But what to do. Because Austin honesctly doesnt compare to CHicago. So i need something fun for him to do while hes here. I mean besides 0th street because he is a club freak. But its great, because hes so much fun to go out with!! And even better, he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above. So essentially he can get us in with no problem (not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls) because all the fun ones are 00 and over. Shhh don't tell my mom I told her i stopped going to them! She found out once because of jessicas crazy parents. oooh i can't stand that. But we still continued and had a jolly time. Everyone there knows us and that we're underage. Its great. really the chicago cops, the whole town is nuts. Everyone thinks texas is laid back, which it is, but really the chicago cops really just don't give a shit. There are so many undercover cops at the doors who know us, and even ones who work outside just patrolling the streets. But they look for more trouble than just underage drinkers. Kind of funny. One night about 0 cops were leaving this really big club downtown CHicago and stopped us on our way out and started asking questions. Like hold we were and blah blah. but they were all drunk and laughing, and traveling around in a paddy wagon!! We said we were 00, we're 00 i don't know why we said that. And they asked for our numbers and offered to take us out with them. But thats just how all of them are. Its sooo weird. But unless you know people its not so easy being underage, ORGNAME not a big underage drinkers fest. Which i really do think the law is ridiculous. If the drinking age were persay 00, then i don't think there would be such a huge   binge drinking   problem for kids when they leave to college. Because if kids are allowed to drink with parents supervision (which in IL its illegal) then the parents can monitor it and teach their kids. That way leaving for college isnt such a huge shock and kids won't get buck wild because they can drink without parents grounding them. Most of my friends parents were real laid back about that issue. All of our parents but one was kind of anal. But im glad i went out a lot in highschool and learned how the manage liquor because now i have no desire to try to get wasted and stupid like the rest of the freshman i see around here falling over themselves. Its really not that bad though. There are just a few dumb ones who arent used to it. I would honestly rather stay in my room during the week and keep up with my classes than drink a beer and get fat for no reason! Ok 0 more minutes of reading my typing. Im sorry for whoever does read this, hope youre not getting too bored. I really do enjoy psychology though, it interests me. I just wish i could have switched into an earlier class because i get out so late every day of the week but fridays!! I took a psychology course my senior year. It was really easy. We had a new teacher so she didnt know much what she was doing, but we still learned. I really wish i took the AP Psychology because they were honestly pretty much always at the same page as us and i heard it really wasnt that hard at all, which i thought the regular psychology was just too easy. At least i could have earned some credit from the AP test. WHoa listening to the fast typing sounds so weird. All of a sudden it just goes rapid fire and real fast! I feel like such a nerd. Im about to go crazy typing for the past 00 minutes straight. Ok someone keeps making noise out there whats going on. I have other work i could be doing right now!!! At least this doesnt have to be edited. That would be awful because i never do the right punctuation when it's not a formal paper. even letters to friends im so lazy. lazy americans. 00 more seconds!! this went by pretty quick though i guess. I still want to eat. I hope i can just fall asleep soon, what movie do i feel like watching? im stuck. ok im done now!!! 
__label__label1      I'm just sitting here by the computer thinking of something to   write about. I just finished my Inorganic class, met a really nice guy   who is now my partner for this, however he is married. Two of my   friends are sitting in this same room, talking about math problems.  Man, am I glad my math requirement is over and done with. I'm also   so worried about my med schhool application. Is this what I really   want to do with my life? On the other hand, do I not want to go ahead   and try? Will I regret it if I give up? Will I regret it if I don't? Sometimes   I think all I'm afraid of is hard work. When I think about applying to   grad school, I start to worry about how hard it'll be to my phD   dissertation! Talk about borrowing trouble. I don't want to disappoint   mama, she does so much for me, but no matter how hard I try, I feel   that she's never satisfied with who I am, even though she always   says she is. I'm glad she came to visit me this time, but I'm also so   scared of disappointing her. If she ver knew I got that C for math. ! I   keep thinking about LOCNAME a lot too. Mama said continuously that   he wasn't the right man for me, deep down I know that too,  so why   am I still with him? He always puts me down, and I know half his   compliments and   lovering   is not sincere. Maybe it's the sheer   convenience of livjng together. Although sometimes I wonder what   the hell's so convenient about it! He makes me spend my money   like there's no tomorrow, I've cried more times with him than at any   other time of my life. However, I've also spent the last six and a hlaf   years with him, so there must be something I need that I'm getting   from him. It's hard to let go of something you've had for so long even   if you know it's not very good for you. I like meeting other guys   though, and it comforts me to know that even if I did leave him, I   needn't be alone. Sometimes I think I'd rather be a little prettier than   a little smarter - like I have a choice! But if I did, I think pretty girls   have an easier life than the smart girls, for the simple reason maybe   that pretty girls don't have much to think about. I used to alwasy envy   the pretty girls at school, even if they were younger and dummer than   I was! It was a shock to realise a few years ago, that they had all   been jealous of me. I sure do miss high-school. Sometimes I think   that was the happiest time of my life -even with all the ons of   problems I had. Living at home with mama and PROPNAME was so hard   sometimes, but I had my friends, and it seems as if even PROPNAME   loved me more at that time. To be fair, he also didn't see me 00   hours a day when we were in high-school either! I loved hanging out   with my friends, I've never laughed so hard as when I was in   highschool. It was nice being known by everyone. I miss my click, I   can't wait to see Ash and PROPNAME and hopefully PROPNAME in the winter.  I'm sure PROPNAME must be going through the same things now. I feel   so bad for him, but being a tyypical boy, I can't ask hi to talk to me,   his sister, about any feelings. Then again. even if I did, I'd have no   idea about what to do if he broke down. That boy's badder than I   thought he was! He always looks so innocent and sweet, but deep   down, he's a real bad-ass! And mama and PROPNAME think I was the   flighty kid. Sometimes I wonder if I really am happy with what I've   become. I don't dare talk about it to anyone because everyone thinks   I'm perfect. My bosses, my parents, my friends and co-workers. If I try   to talk to LOCNAME about these feelings, he just belittles me, so I   really have no one to talk to. I could talk to  mama, sometimes I wish   I did, but then, she expects so much from me, and I'm so sure she'll   scoff at my worries. She treats me as though I was still an   impetuous child, in need of being humoured. I wish I could make   her see me seriously someitmes. So many people are expecting   me to do well, they depend on me to do them proud. I feel like my   grasp on things os slowly slipping away. What am I going to do   when I graduate? Will I ever amount to anything? Will I ever make   mama happy with me and feel as though I have fulfilled her dream? I   miss PROPNAME. For all his bluster and old fasioned ways, he's a lot   simpler to please than mama. And daddy, dear daddy, he just wants   me to be happy, but them, I feel as though he doesn't know much   about me, and daddy isn't the sort of person I cold expose any deep   feelings to. He's just not that kind of man. So I have to go along, and   try to do the best I can with what I have. It's not an especially hard lot   even though I fret so much. I have a great family who would do   anything for me, I have a home and a brother who now lives with   me. I have aboyfriend who even if he doesn't give me verything I want,   apparently gives me something I need. The future I suppose, will   just have to work itself out. These crazy thoughts and fears in my   head will just have to sort themselves out, maybe in time they will. I   have to try not to go bonkers, but I just feel so overwhelmed   sometimes, like I'll never get a grasp on my future, or I'll never be   truly happy. I think I know on thing for certain now, I can never be truly   happy if I marry LOCNAME and I need to try and get away from him if I   can, no matter how hard it may be, and it will be very, very hard. 
__label__label1 My roommate finally just left for work! I don't mean to say finally with such a relief, but my head is just pounding from her music!  I really like her a lot, we get along great, we just don't have the same taste in almost anything. now, I'm not a neat freak, but living in such a small place for the next nine months, I would kind of like to keep the room picked up. I don't think she feels the same way!  this morning, she ate cheerios, but threw most of them away, so our room smelled like rotten cheerios all morning. she finally threw them away, it's not so bad. I think some of her habits and ways come hand in hand with the fact that she is an art major. I don't mean to be stereotypical, it just seems that the artist in her contributes to her taste in many things. twenty minutes sure is a long time to write!  that could also be because I'm not much of a writer. I used to like to write for fun, when I was younger, but being forced to do things makes me tend to not enjoy them as much. now, this is not so bad because I'm not worried about correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. , so I sure hope those things don't matter!  I can't believe I waited until three hours before the due date to do this paper. actually, I can, I am such a procrastinator. I think it is the worst feature about myself. especially now in college, when there really is no time for procrastination. there always seems to be some sort of studying or reading I could be doing, but then again, there are a million other things that are just so much more appealing and at the time seem to be just as important as that homework!  like for instance, it would almost be a sin to not see the final episode of my favorite tv show, or to miss out on what the rest of my friends are doing!  only three other girls I went to high school with came to UT this year, and two of them live right across the hall!  it's so strange how things work out. speaking of strange things, I saw a girl that I was best friends with when we were very young, like kindergarten through second grade!  I couldn't believe we even recognized each other!  it was so crazy!  it was great to see her. then last night, I saw a boy that I went to junior high with, he actually lives on the same floor as me!  I moved around a lot when I was younger, so the people I see, most likely don't even know each other!  wow, I just looked up at the timer and it's already been more than fifteen minutes!  that sure went by a lot faster than the first five!  I wanted to go home this weekend, but I'm waiting until next, our town is having the county fair then. I don't want to admit that I miss home because I told everyone that I couldn't wait to leave!  I was tired of the small town gossip and the close minded ideas of all those small town people!  I do love it here in austin and I even have some family here, but I miss my parents!  I think I might even miss my two younger brothers, now that's crazy!  I think I just miss everything!  I miss my kitty and I especially miss my best friend!  he went to texas tech and I keep telling myself that I'll never see him again, but I pray that I will!          
__label__label1 Right now I just feel tired and when I usually don't look at the key board I notice that I am right now because the timer is messing me up. I see things going across my eyes and hear a girl walking. I just saw her. I can hear computers on and I'm still tired. she laughed and it makes me sad I've been sad for quit sometime now and I don't know why. head tilted to the side and staring and the screen. when I was looking at the key board the girl took my mind off of it and back to the screen. I hear my typing and the girl next to me typing. left foot over right foot and back is relaxing. it's weird to know I took the 00 out of my calculus time to do this instead. I can't type for twenty minutes because when I do I get more tired than I already am. I'm relaxed now and more slouched in the chair than before. my back is hurting me and my fingers are still going constantly pressing the backspace as though I will be graded for typing skills . it's habit the more I stop to not do that it keeps going. right leg is over left now and I'm still typing who would have thought 0 minutes was long? I'm really thinking of nothing right now but then I start to think of the thing I will be heading out to in a few. my eyes are heavy and I can hear the printer shuffling is going around and my hands are getting kinda tired now. I hear someone in the back typing at the same speed and it makes me think they are doing the sam e thing I am doing. I had a long day and I'm tired but most of all I feel stupid. it's only the beginning of the semester and I just turned in my first calculus assignment and I didn't do it right I probably only did about 0/0 of it right. my eyes are getting really tired and head is now tilted to the right. my arms are sticking to the table and it really bothers me that I'm still pressing the back space and yet I keep doing it. I say my friend earlier and head is tilted to the left side now. right leg over left now. I want to go home and I can't head is itching now on the right side. timer isn't really bothering me now that I think about it. I guess it was the first thing I saw left leg over right eyes getting sleepily as though I'm putting myself to sleep and someone walked in but too lazy to look up cause I'm like in a trans right now. I've been typing forever and I'm still going . and going and going my back still hurts and now head is tilted to right I feel like breathing the way my aunt showed me and while back that can  put my to sleep and I have to sneeze it's break time oh wait. it went back and leg is itching and the breaths are getting bigger and eyes are tired. it feels kinda nice right now and it feels as though it's cold outside and why and I so slouched back right now and I keep on messing up what I'm doing and that's bothering me and I'm still in the same spot and it's now been00 minutes and I'm ready to turn this thing off but I can' because I'm afraid of what will happen. will my grade be determined by the time and my legs have moved once again and arms are still in one spot. I wish it was christmas and I keep thinking in my head what the hell was that guy thinking and there's and itch on the shoulder and I should get it but I don't want to. ok it's bothering me. hand are rough and I'm still typing and I'm wondering what's going to go on after this and that girl that just walked in is loud and I believe blonde and I'm wondering if the girl . itch next ot me is wondering why I won't stop typing. ok time to sit up. I took a 0 sec break and now I'm back sitting up right and I've had about 0 itches already. so what was that guy thinking when he typed the directions of at universal remote? was that even it and damn it I'm still here typing away and I'm getting tired and head is now tilted the other way . I wonder why I do that a lot and my legs just moved and I'm just about done here and now my right eye itches and my right ear does too. ok that's done and now my stomach is itching and I'm thinking how bad my hands are hurting me and damn I've been typing forever and I'm still typing I can't believe I lasted this long and I'm still typing this just goes to show that I'm a dork that loves the computers. ok right arm is about to die and so my time is almost up and it's just done now bye! 
__label__label0 My heart is beating so fast. that's probably not good. I'm actually getting . I just sprayed. nervous about writing this. I keep messing up on the whole typing aspect, so I have to stop and go back to fix things. deep breath. this music is so pretty. I wish I had an amazing voice like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I totally just got a shiver from the notes they were singing. ohhh, her voice just squeaked, but it add emotion. That's so amazing. I just pooped my back, that feels all strange. geez, my computer just did this whole weird Sticky Keys, what was that? You should have chosen . such an amazing song. That note he sings, it's gorgeous but he says it as EWWWW instead you. that irritates me. I  don't even now the words. If only he really loved it would. wow, that was amazing harmony. I hope that ticket stuff gets there. I want to be this part so bad, why aren't there any theaters auditioning for this musical. My jaw keeps popping. Why am I yawning so much? Nose, itch. That's so funny, PROPNAME PROPNAME totally looks like PROPNAME the bald eagle from the Muppet Show. I guess I have to go help PROPNAME out tomorrow before. I don't feel good. class. That guy today was such an annoying, rude and evil little man. All condescending and all. I got to stop thinking about that otherwise I'll obsess over it, like I always do. I love that note. it's so high and she sings it so amazingly. I can't believe it's the same girl who sings the part of Ariel in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. He doesn't love her, guys suck. I mean ya she was a Siamese twin, and you know, but I mean he loved her, but because he couldn't live knowing someone else was there he dumped her. I'm so cold. God, why do I keep yawning. I've only been doing this for twelve minutes. My hands are so cold. My nose keeps running. Ricola cough drops are so good. I need to clean up. Of course, I'm not the one shedding and leaving hair ever. on the floor, in the shower. it's so gross. He doesn't love you that's why he is hesitating. Ever time I listen to this, I still get emotional. It's so powerful, I don't know I just connect with them. I think it has something to do with the emotions that you can hear and almost feel through the singers voice and the music. Gosh, my eyes itches. or is it itches. hmmm. I don't know. Ewww, something total floated across the floor. could it be hair. I think so. I know it's definitely not mine. It's so gross. Why did PROPNAME come in here and ask if I was singing. She acted like I should be ashamed. I can never tell that harmony. I want to learn it so bad. These ant bites are really painful. They're all scabby. is that how you spell that. because I kept itching them. My stomach is all nervous like. it's because I'm all nervous about this assignment. and that stupid accountant jerk. I hate accountants. weird folk they are. I am totally finished with this assignment and I'm going to sing, and watch Much Ado About Nothing. yea! 
__label__label0 I need to write this paper for psychology to get a good grade in the class. This assignment is much easier than some of the other assignments I have gotten in my other classes. But, then again, my other classes aren't necessarily hard. I mean, in History of Rock Music, I have to go see a concert and report on it. How cool is that?!  I wish I could go to a Coldplay concert. I would love to go to a COldplay concert. I like their music. I like the Beatles too. I'm listening to a Beatles song right now. I believe PROPNAME wrote PROPNAME". I went to the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert last October. It was totally amazing. I wish I could go again. I saved my ticket stub and put it in a box that I store all the important little trinkets I want to keep. I put all my concert tickets in there. I really need good grades in order to get into the ORGNAME school. I really want to become a film maker. I would love to become the next PROPNAME PROPNAME. Producing seems really cool, but really hard. I would love to direct, but directing seems like one of the most impossible jobs to do successfully. I would love to one day be a well known and respected film maker. I love old films. Last Sunday, the State theater on ORGNAME showed Gone With the Wind. I went to the movie instead of the LOCNAME football game. I don't like football as much as I like old movies. It was so worth it. To see one of my favorite movies of all time on the big screen was amazing. I walked to the theater, and I decided to take the bus back. Only, I was not aware that the busses have different route on game days. I got on the number 0 bus and ended up around LOCNAME LOCNAME. It turned out okay though, because the bus circles the mall and comes back towards campus. I got off the bus on PROPNAME PROPNAME street and had to walk back to my dorm in LOCNAME in the rain. The movie was still worth it. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That's also the name of the main character in the movie: The Usual Suspects. That is a good movie. For the longest time, I hadn't seen it, but then my brother kept telling me that I shouldn't see it because it is excellent. Well, during move-in a couple of weeks ago, when everybody was in a frenzy, I just hung out for a couple of days at my brother's house. While there, I got a chance to see The Usual Suspects. What a great film. The ending was amazing, even though someone had already told me how it ended. I was surprised all the same. AH!  People keep instant messaging me while I am trying to do this essay. I'm going to put up an away message so they will leave me alone for a while. My mother called me this afternoon to tell me that the product I ordered online came in the mail. I need to go pick it up. It was my first order on eBay. A friend of mine and I really like PROPNAME PROPNAME, so I found some LOCNAME LOCNAME team jerseys with his name on the back online for only $00 a piece. We have been waiting about 0 weeks for them to come in the mail, but I guess that isn't that long considering they were being shipped from LOCNAME. I hope they are in good condition. I mean, for $00, one would assume they are in total disarray. I hope not. I really want a PROPNAME jersey. Wow, I am really writing about absolutely nothing. This assignment is awesome!  Now I'm listening to a Dave Matthews Band song. "The Song That Jane Likes". I just started liking ORGNAME only about 0 years ago. My best friend idolizes them and plays all their songs on his guitar. PROPNAME is an awesome guitar player. I wish he was with me here at UT. I really miss him. He is back at home, while everyone else we know moved on to college. I feel bad for him. I wish he would move to LOCNAME with me. He works at ORGNAME and is trying to raise enough money for him to go to school. I love ORGNAME. I used to always get a caramel macchiato, but now I really like Irish cream cafe mochas. Those are very good. I have not really had any time to go to ORGNAME. There's one in the bottom floor of Jester LOCNAME, but its just not the same as an actual cafe house. PROPNAME and I would regularly hang out at the ORGNAME by us for hours on end. We would talk or play cards or chess. I really miss that. Its okay though, he is coming to visit soon, and I will be going home for his birthday in a couple of weeks. It should be fun. I'm really excited about that. 
__label__label0 Here it goes. 00 minutes seems like a long time but I don't have to think really. Wait, that is the whole purpose. Think, Think, Think. The game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but I would never say anything. Just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Well, I see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. Hopefully I can get her a ticket to the game. Maybe I will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that I will buy a ticket for, lets say, $00. I think that should work. Ever since I came here I have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. It always comes off. It really annoyed me, I mean really annoying. So, when I went home this weekend I bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. I have installed them and could not be more pleased. I have beat the mattress! Victory is mine! Its interesting that I can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. Pretty decent view. Tonight, I worry that I am too behind in my classes. Yet, I can't imagine that everyone in the class is. I mean, I do a pretty decent amount of work. I bet I am about equal with most students. The part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make Cs in there class. That is just not acceptable. I have to go graduate school. How hard is it to go to graduate school? I really don't know. I can't be that hard. Or is it? 00 more minutes what to talk about. My suitemate just started the shower. I can hear the water running. I also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. Pow, Pow, Pow. That must be fun. I, however, am trapped in this writing screen. Write, Write, Write. Like a machine. Now I hear jazz music. I've never really met anyone who like jazz music. This kind of reminds me of Catcher in the Rye. Maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME was just a steam of consciousness. I wish I had a hunters cap to put on. Maybe I could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. Where do they go in the winter, anyway? Does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. Or do they just fly away, fly away. Ah! I've received an instant message. I can't read it yet. Must type, type, type. 0 minutes left, almost there. Nope, that is still a long time. I just noticed my rubik's cube. One side is completed, the others? You guessed it, INCOMPLETE. Maybe one day I will finish it. Ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 0 and a half minutes left. Just keep typing. My neck hurts too. This is making me sleepy. I really want to go to sleep after this. Ah, that would be nice. BUT NO, I have to read. Lots of reading actually. In fact, psychology, 0 chapter. Pow, Pow, Pow. He says, Missed the head. " What does that mean? Head makes me think of beer. That lager has a good, hearty head. Nice, only 0 and a half minutes left. I'm really looking forward to this being over. I guess there are harder things I could do for a grade. Like, I can't think of anything. I thoughts a clogging because I keep looking at the clock. Oh wow, here we go, and I am done! 
__label__label1 Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for PROPNAME. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours. Well technically I have enough to apply for PT school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. Some of then have been there for three years. PROPNAME and PROPNAME had been there for a year and a half or something like that. Well PROPNAME isn't working there, because he is starting PT school. I wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I don't think waking up at 0:00 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that I am in school, but I guess I just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. I don't really like not having a job, I like the security of know I have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. Of course, I think school would be less stressful without a job, but I know I could handle it if I had one. Okay I am at somewhere around 00 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since I typed that. Man I haven't been typing too fast, I guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. I should put the stuff I need from the store on a post it. I think I have some stuff written somewhere, I usually have random post its with reminders. I know I have one for the stuff I need to get at home this weekend, but I'm not sure about the store. I'll look after I am done with this. Okay what next. I wish I could type as fast what I can think. I forget half of what I am thinking by the time I write down the first thought. One minute left. I wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. Maybe I should go to the doctor sometime. It could be what I eat, maybe I am allergic to something, or just not eating right. Time's up, I guess this is it. 
__label__label0 I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about PROPNAME lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to PROPNAME yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 00,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish PROPNAME was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When PROPNAME's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and PROPNAME had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. 
__label__label0 I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 00 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like LOCNAME or LOCNAME. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of LOCNAME. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in LOCNAME come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at LOCNAME will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like LOCNAME lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb PROPNAME always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, PROPNAME is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of PROPNAME at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame LOCNAME. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 000 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. PROPNAME has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how LOCNAME lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 000 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing ORGNAME and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if PROPNAME is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 00 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike. 
__label__label1 Today has been a pretty good day. I am a little worried about my computer class because I can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. I am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. I wish my ex would call me just to check and see how I am doing. Never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. I start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. Hopefully I will make the team. That would be really cool, except if I made varsity somehow, I would miss my family. If I was on varsity I would get to travel a lot, all over the LOCNAME, but I would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. I think college is harder than I thought it was going to be. But, the internet up here, the DSL I have at my apartment, is really fast. I downloaded some songs in like  two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. My shoulders are hurting, and I am a little cold. I need some extra sleep. I shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up Friday and Saturday. I think I ate too much earlier, and now I am too full. Well, I know I have a lot to do tonight. I have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. I took care of my pretesting last night so now I don't have to worry about it. I really need a neck and back massage. I miss talking to my grandma every night. I miss living with her too. College is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because I am responsible for more things than I use to be. I just miss the security I think I felt in high school. If I thought back, I'm sure I would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. But I need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing I can do if I don't want to end up living in a box on the street. I hope everything works out the way I always dreamed it would, and I hope I end up in a job that I love. I don't want to spend thirty years in a job that I hate. I would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. I would much rather be happy than rich. Sometimes, though, I don't think that way. I know I am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. And what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. It is going to be hard on me when she dies. But I am not going to think of that now, because that is in the Lord's hands, not mine. I wish PROPNAME would call me. Why?  Why do I keep saying that?  Damn. That is why I am going to stay up here next weekend. If I stay up here, maybe, HOPEFULLY, I won't think about him as much. And, I will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. I have slacked off the past couple of days, and now I'm going to pay for it. Especially tonight, I am hoping to get caught back up. I wish I could go to bed right now. I am cold. Need to turn the thermostat down. Maybe it would save some money if I didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. But, if I didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, I wouldn't be cold. In fact, knowing me, I would be hot. Okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. I wish I had pants on, instead of shorts, then I wouldn't be cold. I wish I had turned the thermostat down before I started this stream of consciousness. I was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so I am glad I am taking this class. There is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. He makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and I don't know anything about skateboarding. I also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. He does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. I mean, when does this fucker sleep?  Oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. If I lived upstairs I wouldn't stomp around like that. It is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. I wish I could go shopping instead of doing the homework I am going to have to do. That would be nice. I don't know if I am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. That sucks really bad. I want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. Yeah, and go to Academy. I hope college gets easier as I get used to it more. I hope it happens soon. 
__label__label1 PROPNAME. This is very different from anything I've had to do before. My finger really hurts right now because I cut it last weekend, pretty deep too, I probably should have had stitches but I didn't. Now I'm going to have a scar on my finger tip and it really hurts to type anything, especially on this keyboard because I'm in a computer lab. I'm not used to this keyboard, I like the one on my laptop but my room mate is asleep so I can't really hook it up right now. I wanted to just plug the internet into my laptop somewhere else, but I couldn't find anyplace, I tried the port in the study lounge but it's disabled. Then I had trouble getting on a computer here. I don't have an IF account because I'm in the business school, they just gave us the logins for that and I've never needed anything else. I'm just glad my friend came along because he logged on and let me submit this. I'm kind of tired. I haven't been sleeping well, I'm used to sleeping from like 0:00 in the morning until like twelve or one in the afternoon. This weekend I didn't sleep Friday night, and I partied Saturday night and didn't go to bed until like six in the morning on Sunday. I slept like nine hours then though because I had been up for forty-six. This week has been weird hours too. Sunday night I slept for like two hours, that wasn't bad, my body only needs like five hours of sleep or so before I wake up and can't go back to sleep. Anyways, two hours sunday night, then I got four on Monday night, none on Tuesday night, and then about three and a half last night. Now is like 0:00 I think, the clock on the computer says 0:00 but I think it's wrong because I thought the clock on the wall said like 0:00 when I came in from smoking a cigarette. ORGNAME. cigarette sounds like a good idea but I have to study some more after this. The sleep schedule that I have is kind of weird with classes in the morning, but I've been doing a lot of studying lately. I hang out with my friends during the day and then study with a few of them at night. Tonight it was me and my friend PROPNAME and PROPNAME studying, PROPNAME went to bed at like 0:00 or so. LOCNAME is here now thank god or I wouldn't have been able to do this until the morning when my roommate wakes up. She goes to bed at like 00:00 and sleeps until like 00:00 in the morning. I don't understand how a person can sleep that long, I can try to go to sleep at a decent hour but it doesn't matter because I have to lay there for like an hour and a half before I fall asleep. Then once I finally do get to sleep I only sleep for like four or five hours, I just wake up, not to go to the bathroom or anything but I can't ever go back to sleep. I hate it when my alarm clock hasn't gone off yet and I wake up. If it's just like ten minutes before its set to go off, I don't mind. But when I wake up and there's an hour and a half or two hours left to sleep and I can't go back to sleep it sucks. Then I just have to lay there and be board when I could be studying. At least I found some other people that like to stay up all night though. PROPNAME is really cool, the other night we stayed up the whole night because we weren't really tired. He likes to sleep during the day but I just don't like to try to sleep. We hung out earlier in the day and then studied all night in the lounge beside the jester desk. We could have gone to a study lounge I guess, but we both have laptops and         
__label__label0 Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called PROPNAME" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called "college life. "  I feel at home and myself here in LOCNAME. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. 
__label__label0 ok. so I am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing I don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although I don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, I have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when I sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. I'm hungry. but I don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, I can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that I am hungry now. I want to eat now. maybe something small when I get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. I can wait. I guess. I wonder if they think its cheap that I'm inviting them over on monday. this way I order the cheap monday madness pizza. but I guess its not really a big deal. I was going to invite them over soon. I want my computer up and running asap. I can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. I hope bilal and them come tomorrow. I mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. I smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, I guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. I mean, lots of people do smoke, but I just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. I don't think I was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was I? oh well. that's what I'm doing. haha I can't believe I was so stupid today. I have been going to urdu class at 00 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if I had gotten there right on time, I would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing I went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! I really didn't think that she would let me sign in. I came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, I have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. I have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. I guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. I don't think I have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as I had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. I like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and I'm upset with raza. I didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. I don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. I'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like I have been typing for twenty minutes straight. I guess this wasn't so bad after all. I wonder what happens after my time is up. will I not be able to type anything else? well, I will find out in 00 seconds. now after this, I got to pick up my I'D from the business school, then. then I dunno. I could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or I could go home and study". but that will never work. hmm, I think I just answered my own question. 
__label__label1 Okay so I'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and I see trees and squirrels and birds. I really like my dorm because when I walk outside to go to class. I always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe I should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute. I'm trying to think what I've done today because I feel like I'm wasting the day away. I woke up at about 00:00 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed. We all went to Subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 00 minutes. I came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves. Her boyfriend broke up with her 0 days ago and she definitely isn't being the sweetest person. She is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me, she freaks out. I think she is jealous. but what is there to be jealous of? It's not like I have a wonderful boyfriend. My ex boyfriend. PROPNAME. he goes to ORGNAME because he didn't get into UT. He will be here in a year. Well. he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk. I feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems. Hmmm. well basically he (PROPNAME) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him. We were together for almost 0 years. Well I told him we might be able to get back together but really I have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to UT and by then hopefully I will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him. I love him still and it frustrates me. College frustrates me right now. I always had a lot of work in high school so I am used to the work load but I am just boggled down with things to do. Like laundry. And sorority crap that is pointless. We had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and I skipped out on it. I feel guilty" but then I don't. I didn't see the point in spending the night at the Chi-O house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 00 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at Scottish Rite. I don't think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever. OH well. what can I do? Nothing. I miss my friends. HMMMMM. I never thought I would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so I could escape from all the petty college stuff. like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking (seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting "wasted". It's like the girls in my dorm (which is an all girls dorm) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they've experienced "Frat Parties" they can't get enough. Don't get me wrong. I love partying and the occasional wild nights but then I also believe that frat parties get old. On a different topic. I have a bunch of homework to do. At least I'm getting this done and I'm enjoying it at the moment. It's very relaxing. typing whatever I want. Not having a strict curriculum to follow. I wish I could meet some guys that aren't just interested in sex. That grosses me out. Look. my thoughts are running rampant. But then I also miss things with PROPNAME. But then I don't miss PROPNAME because I'm in LOCNAME. doing whatever I want. in the heart of the city, but then I stayed home last night . a Saturday night and I was in bed. I guess I'm some sort of loser. I almost feel like if I don't party every single night I am like the biggest LOSER UT has ever seen. I need to separate myself from all this Greek B. S. Hmmm. you know what else I need to do. laundry. read Pyschology. Calculus Homework. That's another thing that worries me. The difficulty of my Calculus class. I have already found a tutor and I'm having mass problems with the homework. Oh well. I'll get through it somehow right? I have tutoring tonight at 0. Isn't this little story of my life so interesting. I need like 0 boyfriends at one time like my friend PROPNAME or like 00 activities to do at one time like my friend PROPNAME. No I really don't need to deal with that stuff actually. I have problems enough worrying about what I should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my Calculus homework will take me (probably 0 hours). WONDERFUL. So much to look forward to. so little time. I need to relax. I need a back massage. I need my mom's cooking and my own bathroom. I won't be getting those things for a long LOOONG time. I have no plans on going home. If I go home my curfew will be midnight. Funny how the parties in Austin don't actually start till midnight. Oh another thing. I hope I make good grades to make my mom happy. She seriously is worried about me and my grades. She probably thinks I'm partying so much which is not the case at all. I think I actually am in my dorm too much. Wait. she is going to get mad because I went shopping and used her credit card. OH LORD. I'll be getting a call in a couple weeks. "LINDSEY. what is this ARDEN B store on my credit card bill? AND why did you spend [ ] amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways?" Oh no. Well I have been doing this for 00 min and 00 seconds and it went by pretty fast. And I'm sure whoever reads this will be like "what is this girl talking about?" but that's okay because I'm sure there's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment #0's. Well my 00 min are up and I am closing this lovely "stream of consciousness" with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch. ?You will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her. She was made to be wooed and won by youth. ?    ~PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 I am sitting in front of my computer in a small Jester dormitory. I look around and I notice that the room is a complete mess. I take a deep breath and I can smell something funny. That's right, that's how Jester rooms always smell like. I am feeling pretty full right now after a eating a delicious sandwich from the Jester City Limits. The room is nice and cold, unlike the hot and humid weather outside. My roommate is out of the room right now, so it's a little quieter than usually. I am playing some music on my computer right now. Besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer, I can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways. My roommate walks in after eating at Jester City Limits. I say hi to him and how his dinner was. He notices something weird as I read out what I am typing. He asks, What the crap are you doing?"  I respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class. I turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next. I am sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room. I uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb. I hear someone using the blow-dryer in the bathroom, which is right outside of my room. I look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks. That reminds me that I have lots of other homework to do when I finish with this assignment. I have a strange anxious feeling because I am a little behind in all my classes, especially with reading the textbooks. I think about how I have missed three morning classes already, a quiz in one of those classes, and I get an awful, guilt-like feeling because I don't want to do badly in my classes. Maybe I should go to sleep earlier tonight, for that matter, every night. I notice my computer's processor making slight noises as I am typing. I take off my glasses because I only need them to read. I look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work I still have left to do. I notice that I have been shaking my right leg. Maybe I have been doing this the whole time?  Some sort of a nervous habit I guess. I feel a little pain on the surface of my knee. I reach down and touch the band-aid covering a wound that I suffered from playing soccer at LOCNAME last night. And the twenty minutes is up. A pop up says that I can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness. Does that mean that I should just finish with my train of thought, or should I keep writing more and more?  Maybe that would help me get a better grade on this assignment. Ok, I am going to just stop and press the "Finish" button. 
__label__label0 Well, I guess I get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. I always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. Oh well, I guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. Man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. I can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since I've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. It's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. I've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. I'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. Hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should I finally start off with something healthy, I mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. That would sound good. I need to do something to keep my freshman 00 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers. This computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and I'm now slowly falling asleep. Aww man, I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. It shouldn't be too bad. I don't even know if I'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. It's not like this is an official paper, but since I'm a perfectionist I can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. I guess it only works on ORGNAME because it's just faster to type this way. I just realized that I get off track too easily, I may have some form of ADD. I can barely even listen to myself talk for 00 minutes. It's really hard when I'm face to face with someone. I just can't stand in one place for that long. So, I just zone out. as I'm doing now. I'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what I write. People sometimes think I'm drunk when I'm sending them mail, like when I sent a post card to a few friends back home while I was backpacking through LOCNAME this summer with my brother. Where is he by the way? Oh yeah, he went to work today. I live with him, I thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. I'd always want what he had and vice versa. So, when we were in LOCNAME, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. I guess the difference here is that . um I lost my track of thought, oh yeah, that we have separate rooms so we don't have to really see each other all the time. Just a moment, I need to change my posture. I'm becoming less attentive to myself. that's better. I wonder where my dog is, it's usually good to have him by my side. He is fluffy and fun to pet, well, at least he is there to substitute for my brother and keeps me company. That reminds me, I was supposed to walk him when I got home, but I haven't come around to doing that. I'll just go in 0 minutes when this is over. He can wait awhile. I wish I was a dog, he doesn't need anything but the occasional love, food, water, and he gets to sleep whenever he wants. I want to just take a while to lounge. I don't even get to do that much in the summer. I'm always active, either moving around, hanging out, or traveling. which I like a lot. Oh, I forgot to ask my adviser about the study abroad program. I'm a big language freak, in French at least, after I've finished learning that I want to do Italian and maybe Spanish. I'm slowly losing my Russian though, since my parents aren't there with me every evening to talk to. I need to move around a bit, my butt is getting sore from the chair. I need to get a new chair finally, this one just isn't doing it. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought, I wonder how much I've written already. It seems like my fingers haven't stopped moving for quite a while. It's a renewed sensation since I haven't played piano for a while. I need to finally get one of those too for my apartment. or else I'll forget how to do that too. It's weird how something you've done nearly your entire life can disappear so quickly. Yay, only a few more seconds left to write, 00 , 0, 0, 0, 0. Done 
__label__label0 so I'm sitting here. I don't know what to talk about. except for the fact that the latest mars volta cd is amazing. I especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music. its panned all different kinds of ways to where if you're listening to it in a portable cd player or anything that has a distinct sound system you can notice all these minute details that they have injected in there. any other way would require you to have incredibly sharp hearing sense. I can't believe I have a kitten now. my mom told me to take care of it and get a job to support it. I just laughed at that. is it getting hot in here? I swear. one second I'm cold and the next I'm burning up. and for some reason I'm having a hard time typing right now. I think its because of the temperature. that and lack of knowledge of what to say. my cat is crawling up my leg and meowing right now. I wonder what it is that she wants. I wonder why the mars volta decided to say now I'm lost" as the most definitive part of the chorus. its pretty great anyways. aww. the cat wants to snuggle in my lap. too cute. I'm going to have to do so much reading tonight. sheish. so many classes and concepts to keep up with. something smells like kitty litter. uggg. kitten. she needs to stop biting me. ahh. she is going to tear my sweater. that is my favorite sweater! I've been everywhere and through everything in this black sweater. I started out with it during my emo days of high school and then grew up wearing it. good times and bad, I've worn this sweater. man. I can't wait until I have my interview with saul williams. its going to be so rad. I can't wait to do research on him so that I can know about every little detail to talk about. hold on. I need to take the sweater off. great. right when I decide to do that the air conditioning decides to come on. just my luck, it always works out this way. I wonder if I could ever get my poetry published. it would be amazing to claim that I wrote a book or compiled just a whole bunch of all the poetry I've written. sometimes I get paranoid that someone's going to copy and steal it since I have it online. not a good idea rola. boy I really like this song. I wish I could write songs this amazing. I just wish my band didn't decide to split. they did it and didn't tell me. lead singer slash guitar player is the last to find out. really genuine folks. that is how life decides to roll the dice though. man, that party after the mars volta showithsaul williams interview is going to be killer. that is, if anyone decides to drive 0 hours and spend the weekend here. hopefully they will. that would be crazy. I need a band again. we need to get our dang cd mastered already so that I can play it on the radio. I need to remember to get one of joey's cds when I'm back in irving so that I can get them to play that on the radio. man, I really hope he gets signed soon. he is so talented and puts so much effort into everything he does. it just feels like he gets nothing out of everything. all the sacrifices he makes and all the time he spends, and he just ends up getting screwed over by life in the end. I wish I could make everything better. I wish I were a magic fairy who could wave a magic wand and make all of his dreams come true so that he wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. I wish I could do that for anyone. I could pick who's deserving or not. that wouldn't be fair though since I wouldn't be deserving of making such decisions myself. dang I'm so philosophical. good thing that is my major. uh oh. I told a psychology write-up that I'm a philosophy major. I'm assured to fail now. eh. I'm so tired. I wish I could get more sleep. it was pretty nice to talk about depression today. hah. I used to be depressed. severely. I'm so glad that all of that is in the past. its nice to look back and learn about yourself. I'm such a changed person. and I keep changing. and I keep analyzing myself and noticing different things about myself from day to day that surprise me and don't surprise me. I wish more people at school knew me. I've always been the person to walk the halls and have everyone know my name but me not know anyone else's name. that is my deal. people would know me. it sucks that this college can't be like that. what? in like fifty five thousand people? you're lucky if you find your own hand in that many people. the buses are so annoying. everytime I walk up to the dang bus stop and stand in front of the doors it just leaves without me. like it knows when I'm about to come so that it can leave. that is how the buses here in austin know when its time to leave the stop. they just see me coming and its the all-time cue. that is what they teach the new bus drivers in training. if they ask "so when do we leave?" they say "when rola comes. " my head itches. press the "finish" button when you're done. twenty dang minutes is a long ace time to keep writing nothingness. its all good in the hood, I have like less than 0 minutes to go. w00t! you know. it seriously sucks that people suck. I wish people could be a whole lot nicer than they are. but what is nice anyways? gosh. we can go all philosophy on that as it is. spend like an hour and a year on that subject alone. screw it. I'm not in the mood to analyze anything. I'm just so tired. and that kitten won't quit messing with the blinds. if only I could stop typing this, get up, and stop that. she is making the blind strings look like snakes from where I'm sitting. and now the string is caught in her paw. just great. its like I'm babysitting. no, it feels like I'm a mom now. just more and more responsibility for me. but she is so cute that its worth it. man. I wish I could play an amazing guitar riff like the one I'm hearing right now. I miss playing music a lot every week. I miss being on stage. gosh I wish I had that feeling right now. ultimate bliss. no! instead I'm sitting here typing this stupid thing so that I can get credit in psychology. I better make a freaking A in this class or I'll be so pissed it will be the end of the world and destiny at the same time. if anyone read what I'm typing right now. I'm sure they would pee in their pants from how afraid they would be that a person like me exists. they're probably getting a lot weirder responses than this though. right? RIGHT? less than one minute and I'm a free-bird! and that is not a pun! whoever yells to play that at shows. dude. you're so behind on the times! that is like the oldest thing to say ever. you're just joining the masses when you submit to saying that at every show you go to. tradition or not. 
__label__label1 I have no clue how to start this. I haven't bought my psychology book yet. Is that bad? I wish I could do that DJ thing at the beginning of class. The guy last time played horrible music. I made a friend in that class named PROPNAME. She seems cool. I hope we get to hang out. This feels like a diary entry. Is that what it's supposed to be like?  Today PROPNAME and I went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. One girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. It really got on my nerves. Not because I'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. PROPNAME is really annoying me. I'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. But hang out with him at the same time. And PROPNAME. I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. I don't know if I love him or not. I don't know if I'll ever really be in love. He says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for  me to say sweet things back to him. But I don't know if I really feel it or not. I think I'm really heartless. And I haven't been in English for a long time! I'm forgetting whether to capitalize the I" in some words. Odd. My arm hurts. Am I going to have to keep this up for 00 minutes? I wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. Mine is all boring teenage bullshit. Let's try and write something deep. It's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. All the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. The faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. Aaaand I'm spent. That was so lame. Bullshit, as my English teacher would say. He is really cool. He made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. And he taught at LOCNAME, which is my ORGNAME. I would love to go to school in LOCNAME. Hopefully next year I can go to ORGNAME and be near PROPNAME and see if this thing will really work out. Are boys the only thing on my mind? Am I really that shallow? At this moment, I'm afraid so. I blanked. I have to start a new stream. I'm losing a lot of weight, I think. My wrists are smaller than they used to be. I don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. I want to be super skinny. And if not eating is how I have to get there, I just might do it. I don't think I'm fat right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear PROPNAME typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see PROPNAME again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give PROPNAME all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. PROPNAME and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend PROPNAME as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. PROPNAME is nice. She listens to PROPNAME. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most PROPNAME girls are lesbians. And PROPNAME, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from LOCNAME that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. PROPNAME gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think PROPNAME is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or wrong way to do it? I hope not. I'm sure I'm doing it the wrong way. PROPNAME just told me that he is joining the army. I don't want him to. And I told him why. And he told me not to be punk rock because I'm an indie princess. That's so lame. Just because I listen to that kind of music doesn't mean I can't have political views. And this was a good exercise. Very therapeutic. Thank you, Professor! 
__label__label1 I cannot believe that my mother called to tell me about the pregnancy test, it's none of her fucking business. Besides she doesn't have to shout it out I wonder if my roommate hear, now she is playing that damn music again. red hot chili peppers. I should really be reading my book for lit right now instead of doing this, I wonder if my watch is going to break again, broke twice today. I just bought that nice new one and I've hardly worn it. Don't want to mess it up with scratches and all. I still can't believe that about mom. She can be such a god-damn BITCH. I think she is calling to see how I am, and instead she just screams at me about the damn clinic. At least I avoided her questions pretty well, but she can still draw her own conclusions. I want to talk to PROPNAME. it's been a while since we've had a good talk. All she tells me about now is her boyfriend PROPNAME. That relationship is trouble. She is not her own person anymore; she lives for him now. She doesn't even stay at home, is over at his place all day, lies to her mom, and uses ME as an excuse. Damn. I haven't talked to PROPNAME in a while. I hope he is thinking about me. I need to call him and also send him his present. Hope he likes the card I picked out. it suits both him and me, so I thought it was perfect. I hope my cell phone doesn't crap out on me again it's so old and worthless. My arm is itching. I wonder if I should wear sunscreen tomorrow since I have been burning a little. trade off between cancerous skin damage and nice-looking tan skin God, I could use some coffee especially since I'll be up for a while reading all that stuff I hope punctuation doesn't count in this I don't think it does anyway. It's probably going to tell me how negative and depressed I am. I am not really, though I am pissed at mom and I hate that I am at UT Even the name conveys a sense of sheer stupidity. I worked my ass off for LOCNAME and here I am in this hell-hole. I hate these damn community bathrooms, and I hate that the laundry room is so far away. God the last time I wrote this crazily was when I wrote that suicide note junior year of high school I hate that PROPNAME I hope he burns in hell for making my life fall to shit like that. If not for him, I might be in LOCNAME right now instead, but grade aside, I can't forgive him for all the emotional damage he did When I read that note later, it made me cry to see how far into depression I had fallen. And mom didn't even help me after I cried out for help. well how ironic that I'm in psychology now. The psychology major needed a shrink herself. hahha. I hope tomorrow is not very sunny but I don    t want rain either. too much sun hurts my eyes. I hope I don't oversleep since I'll be up so late tonight. I can't believe someone cut and pasted a dvd manual in this one time; it's such an easy assignment. God my hips are huge. I have lost weight since I came here, all this walking around. But I want to lose a little more. I wish I had PROPNAME's body. She is so gorgeous! Even more so than PROPNAME, and PROPNAME is one of the most beautiful people I know. But I am not all bad myself, I have my moments certainly. My jaw hurts again; I've been holding it too tensely because I am so stressed out I was perfectly fine until my mom called. well I'm almost finished, just a few minutes left. I wish I had a new phone. I hope that photo of my friends at banquet from last year doesn't fade; the light is right over it but I guess I have the negatives if I want another print. That reminds me, I haven't done photography in a long time. I left because I wasn't progressing, they didn't teach me anything, and I didn't like having to ward off PROPNAME. nice guy, but what a dork and oh so weird. I wonder if that was PROPNAME PROPNAME in front of me in math today. I told penner I'd contact him, but I don't know. what an easy quiz 
__label__label0 I begin by wondering exactly what purpose this assignment serves. I also wonder what will pass as the year goes on. Caffeine. I suddenly have a craving for caffeine. I would get up and grab a Dr. Pepper, but that would interrupt my writing process. What would it be like to be known as Dr. PROPNAME?  Do I really intend to go through with getting my doctorate?  And if so, what happens afterwards?  It boggles the mind to think of the ways in which I may change over the next several years. Wow, I certainly am typing fast. On my old computer, there would have been a delay between the time I pushed the keys and when they appeared on the screen. I very much like this new flatscreen, it certainly goes well with my new system. Every computer I build has some odd quirk to it that no other system demonstrates. It may be my fondness for ORGNAME video cards, or it could be my personality reflecting in the way that I put these things together. All in all, the system works well, but there are times when I just want to drop-kick it out the window. That, however would involve opening the blinds, which would expose me to the eye-squinting sunlight. I have always rather disliked the direct sunlight, partly because it is directly associated with heat. I can stand heat when it causes immediate, measurable pain, such as the burning of a hot pan handle. However, the discomfort of extended exposure to the hot, sticky, mind-numbing LOCNAME sun can drive me insane!  There is a point after which I do not care, but sometimes it seems as if that point never comes. ORGNAME is certainly a subjective concept to the human brain. The saying Time flies when you're having fun" is absolutely true in this respect. If only it were the other way around: uncomfortable situations seem shorter, and the pleasant experiences extended. Alas, that is merely wishful thinking. My roommate's girlfriend just called three times within a 00-minute period. Ah, there he is. "The ol' ball and chain just called", says I. What an interesting concept this telephone is. From pretty much anywhere in the world, you can have instant contact with anyone else that has a similar device. Of course, there is a slight delay due to the limits of the speed of light, but as long as you are on LOCNAME, this is a relatively slight matter. Last week, I spent time with my family looking at Mars in my dad's telescope. Mars will not be closer for next to 000 years, and it hasn't been this close in nearly 00,000 years. From what I have read and heard, though, it has been within a few hundred miles of this distance in the last several years. Calling last week an especially special occasion is barely the truth. The difference is like standing in LOCNAME, walking 00 steps towards LOCNAME LOCNAME, and saying that it looks closer. One-hundred odd miles in over thirty-four million?  Absurd!  Looking at the timer, it appears to be about time to wrap it up. Wow, I just had to correct my spelling on the fly about ten times. I guess that it's not as easy to type correctly when there is another person in the room. 
__label__label0 Okay. This is weird. I don't like assignments like this one. I'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all I find is nothing really. Seems like deep down I am pretty reserved. Well, actually I know that I am so this is not a surprising. Anyways, there it is . nothing. PROPNAME just got home. She is my sister. She had swim team practice. I think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. Does that make sense? Working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. I bet you wondering why I am expressing myself so badly. It has to do with the fact that English is not my native language. I am German. My real family is still in LOCNAME. So PROPNAME is not my real sister. She is part of the family I am staying with. Now I am going blank again. Let's talk about the family I am staying with then. They are very kind. After all, they aren't charging me anything. Why? That's a longer story. I think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. There isn't anything wrong with her. It's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. The funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. And I am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. But it's true. From what I understand you can blame that on her childhood. Her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. Well, it was her they got. Accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. Well, you can derive your own implications. Anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. It goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. Even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. She goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. Anyway, I should be talking about myself. I have my own problems. I can't state my feelings. That is as far as I will go because I can't talk about it. Then it can't be cured. Irony. Now I am thinking about UT. It's pretty overwhelming. In LOCNAME my High School graduating class had about 00 people. Yup. But I will do fine. I am just having these high expectations in college. I want to find my dead poet society" - teacher. Someone that will point me in the right direction. That makes learning an adventure. Right now, I still have to force myself to do homework. Time is up!   
__label__label1 I want to listen to more music. I don't know what song to download next. But oh well. I love listening to music when I study. I wonder why? I like listening to rock and alternative. That is weird I guess. Most people would listen to classical or other soothing music. But I like studying to louder, cooler music. I guess that makes me weird. I wonder how things are going at home. I want to go back this weekend, but I know that I can't. I have a lot of work I want to do, and I really want to finish my Calculus before the due date. I should sign up for tutoring down at Jester. So far the class has been ok though. I understand what the teacher is saying, and I am not having that much trouble with my homework. I hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend. But I know that he is going to be really busy with his internship. He has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work. I guess I may be asking to much of him. I don't want to pressure him to come, so maybe I won't mention it. I still wish he could come though. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? She is like 0 months already. She is getting pretty big. I wonder if she knows that PROPNAME is having twins. So many girls are pregnant back home, that is kinda sad. Most of them are really smart, and they could have done so much with their lives. I'm cold. I wish I could turn of the air conditioner. Well, at least it's better than it being hot. PROPNAME still hasn't figured out how to turn off her alarm yet. It keeps beeping every hour. It is getting on my nerves. I wonder if I take the batteries out if she would mind. I'm thirsty. I should get some water. But I don't want water, but that is all I have. I need to get a job. I don't know how I am going to pay for the spring semester. I can barely pay for the housing as it is. I need more money. I hope everything is going ok at the Ranch. We need the place to do better, or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school. I don't want to quit, but if it comes down to one of us having to leave, then I would rather it be me. My brother is doing well, and my sister only has a year to go. I have only barely started, I can wait a bit longer to go to school. Till then, I can help out at home, and work with my parents at our restaurant. My foot went to sleep. I should move so it can wake up. I have so much work to do today. I need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class. I wonder how my friends are doing in class. I want to see PROPNAME. She should have told me that she got married 0 weeks ago. She said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married. That is a stupid reason. How can someone forget that they had gotten married? I won't get mad though. I am happy for her. I wonder if PROPNAME will ever ask me to marry him. Sure we have talked about it, and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together, but still. Knowing him, he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because I could say no. It is just like when he wanted to ask me out. I knew he liked me and he knew I liked him, but he couldn't ask me. So I finally made him ask me. I said,? We are not going anywhere until you ask me. ? So he finally did. I hope him asking me to marry him won't be the same way. That is definitely not how I picture my future husband proposing. Well my time is almost up, but I need to keep going. PROPNAME is back in the room. She can never get her days straight. She just left again. I guess she is going to the bathroom. Wow, time is almost really up. Time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking. I think that is really cool. Oh well. My time is up now. But I am still thinking. I have pretty much said my life's story, that is really weird. I thought all I would put down was how my day had gone. You know, like a lot of crap just to fill up space. I should stop now because I have a lot more things to do. I think I will stop now. 
__label__label0 hahaha, I really like the directions of how to tell PROPNAME PROPNAME our UT EID and such. I wonder if that is weird to him. PROPNAME is an interesting name, you don't here that every day. its a good thing there's a clock on here, I didn't look to see the time for this assignment. I don't really know what to think. I'm thirsty. my roommate needs to control the noise from her computer, its annoying. my face itches. there goes the noise again. I need to clean my side of the room. why do I have so many cords on my desk, but my roommate has maybe 0?  I think I have a rash on my arm, and it itches. I need to go return my nutrition book to the co-op. eew, a duck on tv has oil all over it. what is the purpose of this commercial?  DAWN?!  that's stupid. that girl from Everybody Loves PROPNAME is a spokesperson for too many things, and when I say too many, I mean 0 different companies. but that's still odd. to me. my arm still itches. I never did anything about being thirsty. wow, I never realized how long 00 minutes is. all of this was written in 0 min:00 sec. CRAZY!  is dr pennebaker really going to read this?  I wonder how many crazy people he has in his class thinking about obscure things. too bad I couldn't do this while I'm driving, I think of some really random things when I'm in the car by myself. I like alone time. I love driving home to LOCNAME by myself, PLENTY of thinking time. I need to go to ORGNAME. but I don't remember what for. hmm. why did I need to go?  this is going to bug me. I think I want to be a ORGNAME ORGNAME. the informational meeting is at 0 tonight. I wonder if I'll make it by the time I finish this. I just noticed that I capitalize random letters. well, they're not random because if it's capitalized, its supposed to be. but I don't capitalize everything that needs to be. so that's weird. I wish I could think of more interesting things. I miss my boyfriend travis. TV without sound is funny. mmhmm I love this bar, this song makes me laugh. I really do wish I were more entertaining for you dr. I love dr pepper. I wish I knew someone named dr pepper. my orthopedic dr is named dr payne. I had a teacher in high school named mrs payne. and mr axe. can you imagine what kind of torture my high school was?  no, I loved high school. I love the fact I'm out!  I still miss my boyfriend. I wonder how many times I think about him during the day. I should start keeping tally. nah, that would be a waste of ink. country singers make me laugh. MUCH cooler than pop stars - they're all stuck up. but man, country singers and music lovers. so funny. hahahaha, this music video is funny. I laugh at things easily. people like being friends with me because I laugh easily. it boosts their self confidence I think. my arm still itches. I wish that pretesting thing would work so I can start on that. that meeting is in 00 minutes. should I go?  yeah I'll go. 0 more minutes in this assignment. I still wish I were more interesting though. the guy in this video just poured a latte on himself. now my leg itches. I love the band LOCNAME. back to the arm. soooooo, basically this was filled with how my body itches. I bet that's interesting. there goes my head. what's with that?  I don't understand. I don't think I usually itch this much. I dunno, maybe I do. my stomach just made a noise. 00 more seconds. lalalalalalalalalala. and PROPNAME PROPNAME BAND rules! :) have a great day! 
__label__label0 I don't know what to feel or think. I am so overwhelmed with everything. I have felt this way for the past two weeks, but it just seems like it is all crashing today. I think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow. I feel like I have so much to do before we leave. I have so much homework everyday, and so much with my sorority, and I just want to have time to hang out and take it all in. Not saying that I never have time, because I do, but not much. Anyway, today we signed for our apartment next year. Its so crazy that you have to do that this early here. But I am so excited about it. I'm living with my roommate, my suitemate, one of my pledge sisters, and both of her suitemates. it's going to be so awesome. So I had to pay that money today and in a couple of days, we have to pay like 000 dollars again, so that is a little crazy. I can't wait until I get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right. like I'm having a blast and everything, but I feel so busy. I missed my first class today because I was so behind on reading in another class. I'm hoping I can control myself with that and not miss too often. I feel so behind in most of my classes. three of my classes have been all reading, and that is so hard for me. I'm such a slow reader. I just need a weekend where I do nothing but homework and study, but I won't ever have that, because there's football here, and I like to have fun on the weekends. so, I love my sorority. They are all the sweetest group of girls. We have such an awesome pledge class. I'm living with one of my pledge sisters who I have become pretty close to her. I love her she is awesome. We had our pledge retreat last weekend, and I got to know so many more of the girls. I can't say too many good things about all of them. and I love the actives, too. The seniors have been so sweet to us. Our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever. I love going there and feeling so loved by everyone, it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place. Anyone of them would do anything for us, and that makes me feel so good, and safe. Did I mention that I feel like I'm doing homework nonstop. haha. I really need to read tonight, I have to stay ahead. or rather get ahead. that is the one thing that I heard over and over again from college students: stay ahead on your work. I need to try harder to do that, because in high school I was such a procrastinator and I can't be like that here. I really need to do good, but does not everybody. especially since I want to get into the ORGNAME program. my problem is, I can study when no one's here, and when everyone on my hall is sleeping or in class, but when they're all home, I love talking and goofing off with them. me and my suitemate love to dance so we always make up dances in front of the mirrors. I know, we're dorks, but we have fun. Our hall in my dorm is so awesome. its crazy how close we got in such a short amount of time. I feel so lucky. Even people on other floors in my dorm notice it, there like, I wish I was on your floor yall are so close. and we're always like, yeah we know. haha. but oh well. so me and courtney are going home tomorrow! I'm so excited. I want to see everyone so bad. I'm really excited to see my sister and my dog. I'm excited to see everyone, but I saw my mom and dad and one of my sisters last weekend at the football game. I have not seen my oldest sister since I moved down here. she is pregnant and due in october. I am so incredibly excited. its crazy. I say crazy a lot, but maybe because that is what my life is right now. and I can't wait to see my dog , ellie, either. I love her so much, and miss her so much. she is a dalmation and 00 years old and so cute and lazy and just likes to be pet. she is my favorite. I need to decide what I want my mom to cook for dinner tomorrow night. I am so ready for a home cooked meal. I wish I was staying a little longer. we're leaving tomorrow afternoon at like 0000, and then we're coming home on friday after the homecoming pep rally we're going to, because there's a football game here at 00 on saturday. and I'm NOT missing a football game here. I love college football, and I love ORGNAME football. it is so much fun. I have to go stand in line for OU tickets in the morning. I think I got a pretty good number, from what I here, so how awesome would that be if I got tickets my freshman year. that's going to be one crazy game, and its going to be so cool to get to go and actually be a part of the school. its going to be totally different than watching in still in high school. my birthday is in 0 weeks. I can't wait. I'm going home that weekend. so that will be really fun. I love birthdays. I'm so anxious for my sister to have her baby, its due in like 0 weeks, so you never know. she may have it early or she may have it late. her name is abby. and she is going to be the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to be an aunt. I hope she has chubby cheeks. I'm so excited. yay! 
__label__label0 I am sitting at my small desk, looking at my computer I am not sure what I should be writing about, so I just type my shoulders hurt and I am ready to go to bed but I have so much more to do before I leave tomorrow to go home I am excited about seeing rich I wonder what we will do I know I have to work a lot and I w0ill probably be tired when I am done, but I will probably still want to go out because all I do here is work, study, work out, and try to keep my life in order cleaning my root day was a pain in the ass, finding places for everything sucked, and I still am not done. it will feel like a dark cloud over my head until everything is in place, which is likely to never occur. my roommate passed out tonight while studying. she works crazy hard and is so focused. right now she keeps mumbling in her sleep. it is pretty funny. I hope I don't disturb her. I don't know if she would want me to wake her up because she fell asleep in her clothes and stuff on her book. I'll probably just turn the lights off or something like that. I am craving some ice cream right now. I want vanilla frozen yogurt with granola. mmmmm. that will be my reward for getting this done early. I am glad that I finished my astronomy assignment tonight. it was just another thing that was hanging over my head. I have all this damn reading to do. and I can't seem to get past any of it because the second I finish one chapter, there is another chapter due in that book and in my other classes. Plus studying for that menu test. it should be fine though. I always get more stressed than I need to over everything. I like my laptop, but these keys piss me off. I don't understand why certain things happen. the cursor moves and it messes up what I am typing. grrrrr. I also want a diet coke. I am having trouble understanding why people gain 00 lbs when they go to school. I walk my ass off to and from classes. I am so afraid that I am going to gain weight. I didn't have time to make it to the swimming pace today. grrrrr. and I haven't done the firm today either. I really should. I need do. but I woke up too damn late to do it. I hope I get up at a good time tomorrow morning. I wonder when rich is going to call. I think when I finish this I am going to take a shower. that will feel good, and rich will probably call super late, whenever fox's closes. I miss him. I hope he is having fun,  I wish I was 00 already. it is such a pain in the ass. I feel so much older. this juv del class is totally opening up my eyes to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking. and it is making me seriously doubt the stigma of underage drinking. I know they have their reasons, young drinking affecting high school, and drinking and driving accidents and whatnot,  but still. How can I be treated as an adult in the court system, work place, and everything else, but still not be allowed to drink alcohol?  That doesn't make sense at all to me. how can my friends be allowed to fight in war yet not drink beer?  that is silly. and frustrating. and now that I know how the laws came to be how they are, I am even more stupefied by it. I love that class and teacher. he teaches basically directly out of the book, so I just have to skim read it, and that is pretty awesome. and his lecture is interesting, and he makes me laugh. that is so important. a sense of humor is everything. I like my nut teacher too, but learning that stuff makes me fee guilty for eating. if these damn pop-ups don't stop soon, I am going to have a serious problem. I am glad I am leaving again this weekend. even though everyone says leaving is bad, I still have a great time at home. and right now, I don't feel like I am missing out on anything here. I am going to try to balance it well, but I love spending time with rich. I love him, and I think he brings out the best in me. he has such a great sense of humor. and I laugh all the time when I am with him. I laughed so much at dinner tonight with them and bryttne. not at brytt so much, but em and I are so open 
__label__label1 I am wondering why I decided to wear this shirt today. no I'm not. I kow why I did. I wanted to look nice. Gosh! Why do people keep sending me messages? I put my away message on. Wow, I can type pretty fast, but I'm getting distracted because I'm wiggling in the chair and my ponytail is tickling the back of my neck. I hear voices outside - what are the girls in my dorm doing? The door just slammed, so I guess they just got home from class. Hope they're not doing anything fun without me. Ouch, my stomach kind of hurts. I guess I'm not under that much stress because (darn, I always mess up because" when I type!) I think I might be getting sick. I really liked that lecture. I learned so much! My neck is kind of tense now, and I hate typing for too long. I type much too fast, or rather I think much too quickly. It's only been 0 minutes. this writing assignment will be a long one, I'm sure. I'm kind of worried about running for ORGNAME vice president. I hate elections, I hate campaigning. Everytime I run for an election, someone always tries to do something really underhanded, like spread rumors or tear down posters or just do something really mean. Gosh, this folder on my desk is really in the way and I think the fan in this room is much too loud. I wish my roommate was her - I'm kind of lonely. I would like to go to dinner, but I think I'll wait until she gets home. But if she is not back soon, I'm going to eat a cookie from the pantry to tide me over. Speaking of tide, laundry accumulates much too quickly in college. I've had to wash a ton of clothes since I've gotten here, and it's way too expensive. Pkus, our washers and dryers don't work right, so I don't think that they're ever really clean. Gosh, I worry too much about my punctuation and grammar. I really doubt whether I sound intelligent in these essays - the structure is not right, the grammar most likely isn't, and the spelling is constantly corrected. There's a blinking light telling me that I have an I'M, but I don't want to answer it. I'm trying to type! Go away! Gosh, there's another message. Leave me alone. NOOOOO!My neck still hurts too. I could really go for a massage. I keep thinking about today's lecture. it really made me feel so much better. I'm so glad Dr. PROPNAME told us that everyone feels kind of stupid and lonely when they first get to college. I know I do. Now the phone's ringing. grrrr. I guess I'm not that lonely after all. I really like the new people that I have met in college and I think that the classes are really interesting, but everyone in my FIG seems to absorb info much faster than I do. I mean, I'm a smart girl, but I have to read and read to understand information. My parents are like that too. They don't understand what they read right off the bat. They have to read it two or three times ot really understand it. I really like having examples or analogies for the stuff I read. It helps to illustrate the point. I don't understand. grrr, the fan is still too loud. just plain definitions. I need more than that. The sun is really bright. I wish my desk didn't face the window. I really wish that we had a better view from the window. All I see when I look outside is a brick wall. C'mon, a brick wall? That's hardly a view. And the girl next door just left to go to the gym or something. She always wears a ton of keys on a lanyard around her neck, so she jingles wherever she goes. Darn! I don't remember the names of the boys I just met outside. They were really nice when my friend introduced me, but they were from LOCNAME and had really foreign names. One was like something with an F, I think. And the other. who knows? Yay! My birthday is on Friday. I can't wait to see what surprises are in store for me. I want to go out and have tons of fun with all my new friends, and then I want to go home and see my family. I really miss them. My mom sends me a card like everyday. I can't believe I left my keys in LOCNAME LOCNAME the last time I went home. My mom finally sent them to me today in a card, which was a relief. Haha, I sighed just now, which I guess truly illustrates how relieved I was. I really want to get more mail. College students should set up some sort of program, like a buddy thing, where they could get more mail. The mailbox hardly ever has anything in it, but today I got a magazine. Cool. And someone just sent me an I'M, but I don't know who it was. I'm almost done. I can answer them! I think I'll do that right now, and answer the other IMs too. haha I guess people do love me! :) Yay! 
__label__label1 What an odd assignment, write about anything for 00 minutes straight. I really like ORGNAME but it is so huge, sometimes I wished I had stayed in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My boyfriend and friends are still in College Station, I was so close to LOCNAME and that is were my family resides. Its only a hour and a half drive but from LOCNAME its an extra 00 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving. My brother is nearby in LOCNAME LOCNAME and that is only spitting distance from here. While living at home this past summer I didn't like it that much, now I really miss those crazy people I call my family. There was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love. I really need to start working out again because living in Austin is making me chubby. You would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking. I have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, I can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow. Its our 0 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one. I have known him for about 0 years now and its definitely better to be friends first. My family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways. He is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money. Money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it. Everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages. What is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in American history. So many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly. Its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth. Its hard to imagine what I would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way. Its hard to think about without getting emotional. I would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, I would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy. Its pouring down rain right now, and I hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside. I'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, I definitely feel I'm paying my dues though and hopefully I can do something positive with this college education. 
__label__label0 well, here I am. writing this essay. ok sorry that was a bit corny. you know. well I just got done taking my first college test in chemistry. it wasn't too bad I guess. but the fact that I stayed you till 0:00 in the morning didn't help much. last night I went to a place called posse. it's a bar that a lot of the people in the band go to. I had a blast! of course I drove and so I had to drive back which wouldn't have been so bad except that it was raining last night. I have a C parking permit. yeah. it's the one that makes you park across the interstate. can you see me running across the interstate soaking wet? it wasn't too much fun. but I got here and got my materials, and started studying in my soaking wet clothes (I had to stay clothed cause I was in my hallway. my roommate was asleep and I didn't want to wake him up. ) I studied a bit, and then got kinda bored with it so I went and got my guitar and played it out in my hallway. I'm pretty sure I broke some rule about quiet hours, but it didn't seem to bother anyone. I was quiet and the songs were soft and pretty. I like to play guitar before I go to bed. it helps me wind down. actually I like to play the guitar anyways. it's such a chick magnet. I have gotten a lot of play just cause I can play the guitar. it's nice. and it's therapeutic. playing guitar that is. I would expect getting booty is pretty therapeutic in some way, but that's not what I'm talking about. it helps me with my problems. I'm not too sure how. well, I guess it just helps me express my emotions and get them out of my system. I like it anyways. I love music. not only listening to it, but performing it as well. I'm in the longhorn band! now that kicks total ass! I mean it's huge, it's a lot of fun, and we get into all the games for free! and actually, this is the best part, WE GET PAID TO GO TO THE OU GAME! YES, THAT'S RIGHT, THEY GIVE US MONEY TO GO TO THE OU GAME! I love thinking about that. all those poor kids with their bracelets. oh well. such is life. I love football too! and what better place to go than here! our football team kicks ass!@! ok. so I don't know where to go from here. hmm. I guess I could talk about how weird it is that when we're asked to think about anything the first thing we do is well, not really think. ya know? is that due to nervousness? is it just some bad habit that teenagers and adults of late have acquired? who knows. I was talking to a friend in your class and she said that she was going to have a hard time wetting this. I think this is pretty easy. I'm fairly scatterbrained so it's cool. I've been noticing this more and more lately. I know I don't have add or anything, but I find myself being absent minded every once in a while. I wonder if add is a real thing. I mean I never really disputed it, but I have friends that think that add is a problem of will power. but who knows. alright. 0 minutes left. what shall I write about for 0 minutes. I'm sure there are some other ramblings I could think of. I play the sax. yeah. I like it. my biology class sucks, both of them really. my 000 is better than my 000 but who cares. I guess I should learn to like them though cause biology is my major. I want to go premed. and become a surgeon. we'll see how that goes I guess. if I don't make it in that, I'll probably switch to music. it would be nice and a music degree from ORGNAME has literally a 000% job acceptance rate. that is no lie. and that's a really good deal. we have a great music program here. we also have an awesome social life here. there's always something to do and someone to talk to . ooooooooooohhhh! less than a minute! almost through! what should I write!?!?! I don't know! oh I know! I'll write about   
__label__label0 Here I sit in the Jester computer lab, wishing that I didn't have to     be here. Why don't I have a computer, better yet, why don't I have a     friend that will let me use their computers? College is not like what I     thought it would be. It definitely is as hard as I thought it might be,     school work wise, but I thought that the friends part would come     easily. I have spent 00 years of my life living overseas with     americans. It was a military base in LOCNAME. The people in LOCNAME     schools systems are incomparable to the people in LOCNAME. They     are open-minded and excepting. I was raised to believe that all     man-kind was this way. I figured than when I got to college I would     miss my old friends, but be glad to meet some more great people in     this world. But here I sit, in this lab, alone. It's not like what I     expected, and worse than I ever thought. I walk around alone, and     although there are worse things,  I use to be known for being loud     and fun. I was the person that everybody knew, and everybody liked. I was somebody on my tiny base, and in my little high school of a     hundred people. But here, I am another face in the crowd. Of     course I didn't expect college to be just like LOCNAME (where my base     was), but I didn't expect to have no friends at all. People haven't even     given me a chance here. I'm just hoping that things get better. They     say that everybody has the same fears that I do, but then I see a ton     of people hanging out with friends. Not everybody is in my boat, all     of my friends are either across the LOCNAME LOCNAME, or at least in     another state. I don't want to be a pessimist, and I definitely don't     want to dwell on the bad, but it gets difficult when everything that I do     everyday is a reminder that I am alone. And here I sit in the     computer room typing this thing, not because there isn't a computer     in my room, but because it is my room mate's, and she won't let me     use it. I let her use anything of mine, I don't even understand how     people can actually be so stingy and be okay with themselves. My     friends have always come before my possessions, and people's     feelings have always come first, and I always know when somebody     is feeling down, and I have always tried to help them. I am waiting     for that what goes around, comes around" saying to come into     action for me. Also, I had decided to be a teacher overseas for my     life anyways, have my children grow up like me. This has at least     cemented my life goals for me. My children are definitely growing up     in a military school overseas. The people there are very warm and     accepting, and living among cultures makes everyone open-minded. I don't like the way that the people act here, and most of them don't     even realize what they are missing in this world. They just turn up     their noses and avoid people who are different, and don't like any     kind of changes. I have been through two evacuations from my     base, and I was just fine. I think that I can probably handle a lot     more than other people, and had they been stuck in a situation like     mine, a new place with nobody that they know, they might be feeling     just like me. But I do know that I will get over this, and I will feel even     more blessed to see my friends and live back overseas; and I will be     positive that I am doing the right thing when I give the life to my     children that I had growing up. I think that it shaped my character in     a good way, and if anybody here were open-minded and accepting     enough to talk to me, maybe they would understand that as well. anyways, I'm back, still here in this lab on this same computer. I'm     still here in this school with no body that I know. People keep on     coming in and out. Do they maybe feel like I do? It is so weird to be     standing in a crowd of more than 000 people, and not knowing     anybody's name. But that is 000 people that I could get to know if     they gave me the chance. That thought use to make me happy, now     I hate the idea. I miss my old life. But I wonder, if I feel like this,     there has to be at least one other person that feels like me. One     other person who feels like they don't know anybody. That thought     doesn't make me happy, but optimistic that maybe I will be able to     meet people sometime. In the mean time, I am thankful for all of the     true friendships that I made during my time spent else where, and I     am glad that I at least have a loving family and friends to pick up the     phone and call, no matter how far they may reside from me, I know     that they care. I no that no matter how alone I am on campus, I am     not alone in the world, and every night I go to sleep thinking of my     friends, and smiling. And I know that in my four or five years here, I     will at least make one friend. Maybe even tomorrow, so I'm just going     to stop stressing about today, and pick up the phone and call a loved     one for now. 
__label__label0 Well here I am doing my first assignment for college. I really like it so far. I had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place. My life is like that though everything seems to just work. I don't know if I am the only person that feels like this (I doubt it) but I feel like I will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but I don't have a clue what it is that I will be doing. My dad seems to get pissed whenever I tell him that I don't know what I want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing. I think that it is because they don't fund my bill. My dorm room is freezing I am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such. My girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at (she had surgery) I hope she is ok. We have been going out for awhile now and I think I love her. I know that I am 00 and don't know what love is but it just feels so right. She is in her last year of college at ORGNAME now so I will only get to see her once a month or so. Everyone says to break-up but it is only one year then she (hopefully) will come to ORGNAME. I don't understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan. I mean maybe if I was one of those people that just love to be in love I would but it isn't that I miss the physical part (though I do) I miss her someone else won't replace that I want her not a body. Now to bore you out of your minds, I am very interested in nutrition/bodybuilding. I played football for 0 years and weighed in at a fat laden 000 lbs. my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football. well I quit due to many factors and guess what it isn't ok to just be fat. I have worked my butt off literally. I now am 000 lbs and have gained strength. I estimate myself at 00% body fat but I want to do better and I know that I can. I spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets. I think it may be dominating my life. But it isn't a hobby it is a lifestyle. But really who else eats every 0 hours? And for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus I have these cursed dine-in dollars but I can only eat about 0 things here everything is terrible for you! I am not exaggerating ok maybe I can eat 0 things but come on! Why do we not have fat-free cottage cheese? lean beef? real grilled chicken not the baby pieces I am paying for now. Why is it always free pizza at 00 at night complex carb+late night=fat why no free tuna, or free vegetables? why is PROPNAME closed from 0-00:00?! So what if I am not in the friggin weight class I know how to lift better than they do let me in! I worked in a weight room for 0 years you think I can't be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work-in etc? come on want to fight the freshmen 00? get better food! we were ranked last in dorm food LAST LOCNAME should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight. this is outrageous. OK Now that I have ranted and let that out I want to know if there is anything I can do about it. NO there isn't how many students would eat fat-free cottage cheese? or tuna straight from the can? not enough to get the food people to bring it in. Oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy! something just buzzed in my room. my hands are numb spend the a/c $ on some real food!        
__label__label1 Well, lets see, what am I thinking. All I ever really have time to think about is school. I am so stressed out, since I changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, I'm reading for hours each day and I'm not a big reader", I read very slow, and I have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. To top it all off I have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and I have another one the thursday before that. Talk about brain overload. One thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff I'm reading in all 0 classes and some of it I'm finding in my psych readings too. It's all just overwhelming. This week I have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. I was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but I had class from 00-0 so she was home when I was done with class, so I'll be doing that later and I have to buy all this stuff for it too, I don't have a job, I don't make money, and I don't feel like I should ask my parents for more. The big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $000, that's a lot of money I could really use. I could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, I have all this other crap I have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. He is not in school, he should a job, why to I have to loan him money, well no more-EVER. Well at least not until I get my money back. To top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, I don't a boyfriend who's in jail, I want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 0-00 years. But it's so hard because I love him, or at least I think it's love, it has to be or else I wouldn't put up with all his crap. It's not just all that, I'm somewhat of a neat freak and I like things to be clean and keep things the way I have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff I've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because I'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that I would even get upset. Now he keeps saying are things going to ok when I get out blah, blah, blah. I don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than I can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what I get from school, I don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. I should probably end it, I know I won't cry-I'll miss him but I've already cried enough for him. You know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. I don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. One good thing that came from him is my kitty, PROPNAME. One of his friends couldn't keep her so I took her. She is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. I feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. She is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but I still feel bad, I didn't do it to hurt her but I know sometimes she is in pain. That was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing I have to do for her. She is about 0 months but she is still relatively small, I'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. The world's biggest cat weighed 00 pounds, I can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. I just think that's incredible. Wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done. 
__label__label0 Today was a very hard day at school. After my first class, M000D, I read my Economics book for what seemed like forever. My friend PROPNAME can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. He is one of those, Everything has to my my way" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in "Spanglish" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. PROPNAME is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with PROPNAME PROPNAME's. The timer says 0 minutes 00 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do. Put up our sheep, clean the pool. My mom is going to kill me if I do not get those done. I guess I can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 00 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on LOCNAME. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 0 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $0 off a bag that I could get at ORGNAME for about $0. I did not get one. but if I had a quarter on me at the time I would have. I need to turn on my light as I can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. It is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. I needs to rain. They say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. Those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to "predict" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. But a weatherman does seem like a cool job. You can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying "Well we try to predict the weather the best we can but PROPNAME PROPNAME does what she wants sometimes. "  Alright, I only have 0 minutes left to write. My the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. My computer is getting old and I need a replacement. I have pop-ups bad. Somehow, somewhere, I got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. In doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. Basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. User-initiated contact goes through unmolested. So by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. I only have 0 minutes left to write now. That is good. Man, this is a sweet part of The Rock. This is the scene in which PROPNAME PROPNAME is in a yellow ORGNAME and is chasing PROPNAME PROPNAME, who is in a black Hummer. This scene has a lot of good action. I like action movies. I guess as I guy I find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. My belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. Without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. I still need to get my Economics book. I got the main one but the second one is still at the Co-Op. My luck they will run out of it by the time I remember to go by and pick it up. My dog needs to stop scratching. And my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. I would find that annoying. Man I could really use that drink now. Good thing I have less than a minute left to type. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME. "WooHoo!"  This has been fun. I actually wish I could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. Hope this is a good paper. Oh, it says if I want I can still keep on typing. In that case I think I will. Where did my remote go?. HAHA. got ya. you thought I was going to type more didn't ya?  Well ok I am done now. I can finally un-mute my TV and go get that ORGNAME. 
__label__label0 I like doing these sorts of assignments. My english teacher last year insisted that we do a stream of consciousness writing at least once every six weeks. It's not only easy, but interesting to do as well, especially when reading back on what I've written. I'm in the dorm now. It's cold. My toes especially are cold. they seem to get cold pretty easily. I'm watching the Simpsons as I do this paper. The TV show is awesome. I play the saxophone in band and my section last year in high school based ourselves around the Simpsons. I was PROPNAME and the director that played Saxophone was Homer, and other people were other characters as well. Fun times. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow because I have class that starts at 0:00 (music theory) and I'm going to have to sing for the class which I'm not looking forward to at all. I only have a decent tone in my voice for about an octave and then my pitch starts to go down the gutter. I'm a music studies major and I'm actually looking forward to my private lesson tomorrow with my professor as well as the saxophone choir class. My professor is known as one of the best, if not the best saxophone player in the nation. It's neat to learn things from him, but at the same time it's also sort of nerve-wrecking for me. I'm really full. I just got back from dinner; two chili dogs, french fries, a cookie, and coke. Good old healthy dinner (sarcasm). I actually do try to watch what I eat here at school since I don't have my mom around to force feed me vegetables and fruits. I'm thinking about getting another coke from the 'fridge right now. The Simpsons is really distracting me because I want to watch it because it's so funny. but I know I need to be doing this. Typically I would turn off the TV to do homework but before I began this I sorta figured the tv would help give me something to talk about. Is that cheating? thinks about it Nah, shouldn't be. I'm here from LOCNAME and it's nice to know my way around. All these new students that don't even know how to get around the campus yet. and just think they have not even begun to explore how great LOCNAME is. I was thinking about showing around some friends since I have Friday night open. I was going to ask this one girl on a date but turned out she had a boyfriend already. Luckily I found that out before I had gone and asked her out. But yeah, since I have Friday open now I figured I should go ahead and at least show my roommate around. He didn't bring his car this semester though so I don't know how much he had benefit from seeing all of LOCNAME. I can't help but look at the clock and think GO FASTER!". My roommates computer just started making a very high pitch noise and it's really really really bothering me. My ears are pretty sensitive and this sound is actually painful. He needs to hit is computer to make it stop. I did it once when he was not here (hah). Oh well, it should stop eventually. I'm still feeling really full. I should probably go work out around 0pm. I worked out yesterday for the first time in a long time and my legs are really killing me. I concentrated on my legs more then my arms/chest. I wish I had worked out more over the summer. I worked out a lot over my senior year but when summer came I worked a lot and when I didn't work I was out boating. My allergies are really bothering me. It gets so cold in here that they start to act up. Every morning I wake up and have to sneeze because I'm so cold. I also hate getting out of a hot shower and stepping onto a cold floor and into cold hair, it makes me want to stay in the shower all day. My roommate is worrying over astronomy, haha. I passed out of math and science for the rest of my life through AP tests and SATII's. I actually wouldn't need this class because I already have Economics credit which is a social science but I need Psych. for my education certificate or whatever it is. (I plan on becoming a band director). I'll probably be here for five years. I don't think anyone has ever graduated in 0 years that was a music studies major, even if they took summer school. I plan on taking some summer school at ORGNAME, but not much. I'd like another cookie, although I'm full. Only three more minutes to go, this actually hasn't been all bad, and hasn't seemed that long. I thought about chatting with friends on the internet at the same time while doing this but I decided that wouldn't be very efficient, plus this would have been much shorter. I hope this is long enough. Which it should be. My roommates friend from HS just came over. They're from LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. which is down on the border between LOCNAME and LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm interested in going down there just to see what it's like. My roommate says that PROPNAME is much better than ORGNAME ORGNAME will ever be, which I wouldnt be too surprised of, but I don't know. I can't wait for the weekend to get here so I can go hunting some more. Dove season opened up on monday. I got 0. it was a very slow day because it was lightly raining so birds weren't flying much. But getting four put me ahead of the rest of the people I went with. I was just alerted that 00 min is up, so I'm stopping. 
__label__label1 Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 00:00 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. PROPNAME is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 00:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 0: Check, Chapter 0: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 00 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want PROPNAME(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to LOCNAME LOCNAME instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 00 minutes- good bye. 
__label__label0 I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing," but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is going well. I got paid $00 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to "diet" for the next week, though they stress that it's not "diet[ing]," but more "finding a homeostasis" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a ORGNAME box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to ORGNAME for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because ORGNAME is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 0th of may, they don't get out till the 00th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked PROPNAME, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate PROPNAME and I might go visit them up in LOCNAME during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the PROPNAME PROPNAME soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at ORGNAME with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie "The Good Girl" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have. 
__label__label1 I am so cold right now, and I want to take a really long nap. I have so many things to do and I don't know where to start. I miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. I don't know if I like the whole idea of growing up. Sometimes I wish I could be a kid forever. My roommate can sometimes become annoying and I just want to scream. My suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. I really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. The cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. I had the best ice cream the other day at LOCNAME LOCNAME. It was cake batter flavor. Crazy ,huh?  I am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. I am now happy to be in the school of education. So many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. But I am glad that I have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what I truly would love to be. I think I need to take a shower. I want to have a family when I am older and I can't wait to get married and have kids. Someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. Our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. I've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and I hope to build some very good friendships here in college. I tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. I play with my hair a lot and as a result I need to get my hair trimmed. People think it is ridiculous but I have done it since I was a child. I had a conflict with my sister this weekend. I hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. She is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. I think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement" in college which she did not take advantage off. It's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. I hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on Friday. I really need one and hate relying on someone else's. I wish I was able to pay for it but right now I am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. My mom is the greatest mom there ever was. She would do anything for me. anything. I wish that her and my dad were closer though. When I was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. I really hope that I can plan a trip to go on for Spring Break with my boyfriend. I have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. I wonder if my friend martin from LOCNAME is going to email me back. I haven't heard from him in awhile but I think sometimes he behaves in ways that I would not tolerate. I wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. I guess I need to buy a new blade. My little sister is painting her wall with a mural of LOCNAME LOCNAME city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but I don't know about that. My mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but I think she should be a little more realistic. I really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where I can actually move around. I really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. I am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes I worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. I really could see us getting married but I guess I should leave that to God, if you know what I mean. I love pizza an ice cream. I wish they weren't so fattening. I need to go kickbox this week. It's not the same here as it is at 00 hour fitness. It's cool though. good exercise. I'm really tired of typing. I got to go tan outside today. 
__label__label1 I am eating a ORGNAME's bar with almonds. I told myself that I would only eat one little square of it, but as I can see, that didn't happen. You would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry. For more sweets. That's interesting.      As I'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on ORGNAME instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words I've already typed, so I have to keep going back and deleting and starting over. Annoying.    Over the Labor Day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way. On that note, I used to not like having a birthday so near a quote "holiday" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and I wouldn't be able to get together with all of them. Now that I've entered COLLEGE (smile), I've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday. To spend with special people (bigger smile). Anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) I celebrated my 00th birthday with my family and my BEST friend.     My mom used to attend ORGNAME ORGNAME, in fact, both of my parents did. Unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home. Anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years.    My dad is a self-employed architect. He used to work for a large corporation in LOCNAME, but hardly had time to have a life. A life away from work, that is. My mom likes to say that when I was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - AHHHH! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: "Look, there's your Daddy. "  Now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons.    My little brother, PROPNAME, was born when I was nearing 00 years old. Currently he is seven years old, in second grade. He came as a HUGE surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile. But obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong. He is very active, and shows so much love that I don't know how such a little body can produce it. Right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, PROPNAME.    Speaking of PROPNAME, I met him in high school. We both attended ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, a magnet school in LOCNAME LOCNAME. By chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year. That was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together Project Graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation. Actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 0000 students total; around 000 in my class. I didn't get to what I was saying, but I guess I'll leave the juicy stuff for next time. 
__label__label0 I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing PROPNAME's "Hot in LOCNAME". The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it. My desktop died on me while I was up at LOCNAME and I am shopping for a new computer. The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it. But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 00 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it. All in all, life on the computer side just sucks. I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in LOCNAME until tomorrow when I go back to LOCNAME for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend. But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in LOCNAME, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises. I have late classes on ORGNAME and I don't get up until like 00, but I still am awakened by construction at 00 or so. Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck. He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him. He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do. So that is cool. It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers. So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on ORGNAME, like I am writing to my best friends. When I get back to LOCNAME, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at ORGNAME, into my freshman year. But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT. 
__label__label1 Ok. I'm here in the ORGNAME building during mandatory study time. I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.   Well. Anyway, let's see what's on my mind. The ORGNAME are really bad. I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and PROPNAME PROPNAME will be fired. He really is an Awful manager. Personally, I liked PROPNAME PROPNAME. Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager. Hmmm. well. my friend PROPNAME PROPNAME, who used to work for the mets, sat down with PROPNAME PROPNAME the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for PROPNAME PROPNAME. They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse. For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather. There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing. Is that a little bit disconcerting. Yes. Oh well. I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time. 0 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track. I just turned my cell phone off. PROPNAME has handwriting that's hard to understand. My battery life remains surprisingly high. Wireless internet is pretty awesome. Wow. This is the first time I've used wireless internet. I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 0 or 0 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 0:00. I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 00 pm. I should have brought those quarters. I knew I should have. But then I would have been late. I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness. Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today. She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today. That's sick. My dads had that car since before I left for school. That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 00 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste. Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet. I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going. I thought Id miss it a little bit. And I kind of do. I miss the actual acting aspect of it. But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all. It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit. It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside. Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories. My finger. No my thumb really itches. I'm thinking I should wash my hands. They feel pretty grimy. I did wash them after I ate that sushi though. The sushi was surprisingly good. On the other hand it should be good if its $0. The smell in the room. Well there is no distinguishable smell. Back in jester though. WOW. That place smells incredibly bad. It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with PROPNAME is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low. I think my 00 mins is up. 
__label__label0 I just finished taking the prescreening survey and I could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive. I'm not even sure that I will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if I'm qualified. I don't feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests - the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser, I guess. I have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday, and I surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it. I feel alright talking to people, but somehow it's different typing my feelings onto a screen. this screen represents nothing to me right now, I don't know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this. somehow I'm still making sure that I am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar. anyway, the event that I found out about yesterday. involves losing a person that I knew in high school. I can't stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls, and now one of us isn't here. it's very clear in my mind that we weren't the best of friends, but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well. I personally haven't spoken or seen her since graduation, but I knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else. now that I think about it (and I can't stop thinking about it) she is one of the most brilliant people I have met in my life. she graduated 0th in our class, and spent this past summer at ORGNAME for a research project; definitely someone who was going somewhere. I never thought that something like this could happen to one of "us," the people that basically built the foundation for the person that I am today. I know we weren't the closest that friends could be, but my best friends are wrecks right now, and that affects me. it's a direct and indirect effect, not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing, but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me. I'm tangled and I'm not sure where this leaves me. I hate that I can't remember the last thing that we said to each other. nevertheless I was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world, and I was off in mine, both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world. it's not fair that her life wasn't complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do. it's not fair that they found her the way that they did; it's not fair that we don't know and we won't know for a long time. the truth of what happened. everything is so complex. I can't call anyone; I mean, I can call, but I don't know what I could say that would offer any comfort. it'd be different if I were there with our friends, must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands. nobody here at LOCNAME went to my high school, and I doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew. I feel alone, I feel helpless, but at the same time I feel like I'm connected to everyone else who knew her because, well, we're all probably feeling alone right now. college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves, become good individuals in this world. at the same time, in the time between our high school graduation and now, we've all become isolated from each other. it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious. all time in the world is precious now. things that I was worried about before I heard the news, any stress that I felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared. homework and little things seem trivial to me. in a way things seem simplified now: we either are. or we aren't. just being here doesn't seem right- but is it selfish to be so so glad that I am here?  I wonder if I deserve it, or if I can earn my place here. then again, who knows if it's so bad on the other side. I see that I have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness. what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular, and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as I press "finish," yet for them to linger in my mind still. any other day I would have felt that this assignment was worthless, but I'll admit it. feeling like a part of myself is being put out there-a huge or small risk, I'm not sure-makes me feel the slightest bit better. maybe 
__label__label1 Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 0:00 today because I have an 0 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 00 to 0:00 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my ORGNAME 000 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 00th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later. 
__label__label0 Got a Beatles play list going in ORGNAME. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds first up. Possibly my favorite. I remember back senior year of high school, I gave PROPNAME crap for liking The Beatles. Stat bwaahaha. Moreover UIL math and science bwahaha. Hey, PROPNAME has that guy from ORGNAME ORGNAME, I think his new movie is Little Black Book. Doesn't look too good. PROPNAME PROPNAME is funny, I should take PROPNAME to see it. I should call PROPNAME sometime tomorrow before she calls me, if she calls me tomorrow. Last weekend was cool, hanging out with her like every day. Ah, PROPNAME Fields Forever next up on the play list. ;Staring at the empty Sonic bags on the floor  I like Sonic. Saw Saved yesterday, kind of hits the spot somewhere inside. Not having a religion isn't bothering me as much as I think it should, but then why should it? Still have two pages for HIS discussion tomorrow. Discussion sections for HIS, American History 0000-0000?? Just talking about history. Boring. Talking about the mind and why we think. Interesting. Ooh, good song now, Come Together. I wonder if there will be a keg tomorrow afternoon? It's always nice coming back from class, taking a nap-a-roo, grabbing some grub, and filling' up a cup. I ordered a BMX bike tonight. Ok, from that pre-screening thing today that took way way longer that 0. 0 hours, but that's probably because of my connection, it has been crappie' up all day, absolutely ridiculous, we live in an age where technical difficulties like these shouldn't be. Anywho, yeah so mark me down for a little anxious and nervous about this recent BMX online purchase tonight. I got an email verification and all but when I typed in the tracking package number, nothing showed or came up, so. A little worried. Next song,  ;drum rolls please. Let It Be. LOCNAME LOCNAME? 00. 000? Strawberry? Crazy things went down today, cops on motorcycles, people slamming into the back of other cars, anti-freeze spraying all over the place, high speed chase, people being arrested, all before logic?!?!?! You know it's sad but true. Next song, PROPNAME PROPNAME. Good commercial, ORGNAME ORGNAME, mmmmm. I should play golf sometime. I have one "Pimp My Room" upgrade point. I don't really mind letting my fellow co-opers use my truck, just don't mess up the trust, right? At least they lock the doors. Gas though? Other perks? Will it last all semester? All year? I find it interesting because I don't know the answer to that. Last song, Revolution. PROPNAME, the pop-up just told me my 00 minutes is up, so I'm out! 
__label__label1 Right now I'm writing about the things I am thinking of. I just got my hair cut and now I'm drinking a coke float. which I probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 00 is a big thing these days. my boyfriend just called and I like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes I just wonder like if I'm doing the right thing. actually I wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived. now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 00 years - that's a long time. I'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents. today I went and bought some clothes, which I probably should not have because I have a lot already. this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this. today we had a parade in my home town. yeah I'm home again. and it was cool. PROPNAME is a senior. I wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie. today is the football game, I wonder if LOCNAME will win. ORGNAME lost really bad last night - LOCNAME their not as good as they think they are. mom is sleeping and she snores a lot. dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting. coolcherrychick has just signed on. cool. lol wow my hair is really short. man I can type faster than I thought I could, I guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! I can't believe I found pants long enough for me at ORGNAME, that like never happens because I have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal. now coolcherrychick has just signed off. why do I like coke so much? I mean I don't drink it that often because I don't allow myself to, but I do enjoy it a lot - I guess the caffeine. I have problems spelling. this coke float is super good. thank god he stopped. ha-ha I just wrote stuffed before I erased it, anyway with the window. my hair is really cute, at least I think so. for once I'm not cold, its amazing. rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least I will have a coach forcing me to work out and I can identify with a team. I wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, I mean I can use big words, but I really don't think in big words. my cognate. however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that. I hope rhea's oh regina's home, I hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, I don't think she really tried very hard but I mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible. regina and laurie just got home and as I'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something I don't know and I feel bad but I have to do this assignment. oh well I hope they didn't think I was being rude. this is kind of hard because I think so much faster than I type. mija just ran with laurie. she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but I guess I do to when I don't take a bath for awhile. I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it. PROPNAME called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 00 something but looks a lot younger. like 00 or 00 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general. I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer. I like that song and I can't believe a 00 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself. PROPNAME is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it. I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it. I mean I can jump high, but I can't hit hard. wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, I am glad I am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow I really have problems typing. today I changed in the car, that was really not fun I should have planned it better. oh well I guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking. usa wow I'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices. shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time. it would be so nice to be rich. I need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol. breathing is a good thing. laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun. my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.    
__label__label0 Working out is stressful. Especially if all I do is arms. Man I am tired. I wish I could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout. I need to go to the bathroom but I can't since I have to right this. I'm glad that I finished the reading assignment over the weekend. Oh my arms are so heavy! I like working out but sometimes it takes a toll. My biceps are bulging and pulsing. Man I wish I could play a game right now. And now I have gone blank a little. Its tough to do this. To think about what one is thinking. I need to move my mouse. There we go. Now I need an arm pad or an extension to my desk. Man I wish I could rationally think sometimes. Or maybe I do. I really need to extend this desk. Now I'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good. Wow, now I'm getting thirsty, but its probably because I just got done working out. It says it is 00 degrees outside. Let me actually check. It is. A shake would taste good right about now. Jester 0nd floor was good today, but not like I had expected it. A lot cheaper though. Its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than Dine in dollars. I've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner. I usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner. So I wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner. It probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then. Who knows and honestly who cares. The room next door to us has a very squeaky door. It slams hard. Ouch my deltoid. I am hungry, or maybe thirsty. I really can't decide right now. Ouch! Wow 00 more minutes. This has kind of gone by fast. I thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment. And I'm so glad I did my readings the weekend before. It allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment. Those 00 seconds went by fast. The people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me. Up till like even 0 am in the morning I can always hear people outside my window. I wonder why they are up so late outside. Usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind. Well I'm going to get something to drink right now. I have had the grape flavor yet so I'm going to see what that's like. Never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one. Going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how I was sore, or maybe just tired. Now I have a coke though. But I need to fill my food void. Some applesauce would be nice. But I do love sour punch straws. Mmmmm. They are so good. Nah ill have applesauce. There are also some grapes too. Green grapes! My favorite. I don't know why but I've never liked red ones or purple. WITHe they call it. My favorite color was purple because I loved the grape flavor so much. Now I've changed my ways because I've learned that purple is a feminine color. Now to get some applesauce. I have to have 0 at a time or its not enough. I'm a klutz. I always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to. I don't know why but I've been wanting to get fatter. Or at least gain wait for a long time now, but I need to eat healthy because I have high cholesterol. I always wanted to gain weight because of football, now I just say it because I always have. When buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible. They are 0oz each. It says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple. Yes! 0 minute! This applesauce is a little watery. I hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it. That really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat. But it goes good with French fries! 
__label__label0 Ok, I guess I should be typing, that clock is making me kind of nervous. Well, whatever, I just saw my roommate, I really didn't know she was going to be here. I feel really nervous, I don't know why. Oh yeah, I really need to work on my first paper for my English class. I hope I get a good grade, because when I work on it, I feel as if it should be harder that what it actually is. Gosh, my math class really sucked today. I did not understand a word she was saying, but that's ok, because so did the rest of the class. I wonder what my mom is doing, oh and my dogs too. I really miss them. Even though my dog hates me and is kind of crazy, I miss him so much. 0 minutes, that's it! It feels as if I've been typing forever. Before I forget I need to talk to Daisy today, man that girl is so crazy. I also got to talk to PROPNAME, just to see how her day went. PROPNAME was being so funny last night, I really like talking to him at night, even though we talked until like midnight. I wonder what kind of music that guy is going to play in my psychology class. He usually plays weird music, today it's going to have to do with the brain, that'll be interesting, I suppose. I hope I'm doing this right. Who ever reads this, if it's ever actually read, will probably think it was lame. Oh, well. You're also going to find plenty of mistakes, opps my bad. Gosh, that sounded like a line out of that movie: Clueless. I feel clueless a lot, so that's ok. I can't wait to go to sleep, that's one of my favorite things to do ever since school started. This past 0-day weekend was great because I got to wake up so late and just hang around my dorm with my roommate. She's cool. I'm so glad I get along with my roommate, because I've been hearing some roommate horror stories lately, I guess I lucked out. Wow, I've been writing for 00 minutes! I guess it was harder to get started. I wonder if the people around me think I'm writing like this really long email to someone. they're probably thinking I'm a loser, ha-ha. that's kind of funny to think about. Daisy is probably talking to her internet boyfriend right now at a computer on campus. Her boyfriend is so funny. Some girl just sat next to me, I hope she doesn't read this. I don't know what else to say, my time is almost out. Ahhhh! I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this. Well my time is up, it was great, but I've got to print out my biology lecture. 
__label__label1      well, I wonder why I'm here. languages can be a real problem especially when you have 000 pages to read every day. Maybe this is what people called college live. no time, no entertainment, no nothing. maybe it's not the case for native students!  so why am I here?  Am I anywhere better than them?  Or will I ever be better than this advantaged people?  what advantage will I receive once I finish this college hell?  hell with it. It's not so bad actually. maybe. I don't know. There are so many things I want to do, but don't have time for. I have to fit into the class room, so I got to read the textbook, pretending that I'm cool with it. Who knows how I'm doing?  I don't even know that. Sometimes I wonder what will come after. After all this years of staying and trying to fit into a culture that I don't even like. Is it money that draw me here?  Or is it something else?  Maybe I'm just tried of what I used to do. Although I don't know exactly what. Live repeats itself, again and again that I don't know whether I've done it already or it's just a similar experience. Memories are tricky. They fool you, mislead you, and abandon you. Am I here for the 0nd time? Or even more than that?  What am I searching for?  Trying to reach a perfect life?  I wonder how many times more do I have to live in order to achieve that. Enough for the questions. since there will be no answers to that. PROPNAME is a nice place. The weather is quite similar to LOCNAME, but not as humid. People are busy, as they did in community college. but the more people there are, the easier you fall into isolation. I don't remember when I get my first "friend" in college, but people seemed more relaxed back then. Memories make things look at its best. That's how human survives. Cell phone is also a devise that's supposed to do so. But do they?  People get more and more dependent on such thing. They want to be connected. but with whom?  What's the meaning of saying hi on the phone and trying to find a correct time to hang up though out the conversation?  Cell phone is tiring. They only work when you need to be picked up. There lots of quite Asian girls on campus; I wonder where they're from. Are they having the same troubles?  I don't see any good looking Asian guys out there. Too bad, it's always easier to find good looking girls than guys. Well, as long as it nurture my eyes. Not being able to see good looking things can be a torture!  That brings me to another problem in LOCNAME. No comic book store!!!  And I can't even watch the DVDs I brought. Damn capitalistic Americans. Region settings is plane stupid. 
__label__label0      Man today was a really long day. I'm a so tired but I have all this crap to do still. mostly calculus. I don't know why I took 000D. its so freaking hard. I hope I'll do okay because I just have to. I signed up for tutoring but I don't know how much that'll help. I like this cd I'm listening to. I've listened to it a million times but still like it. man I'm really upset that alias isn't coming on this season. I love that show. It was one thing I was looking forward to this semester. I wish I could be like LOCNAME and kick butt. but instead I'm really boring. man I am so freaking tired. the bathroom has gotten really disgusting. I don't want to be the only one to clean it but I don't want to be the only one to complain that its dirty. I hate cleaning toilets. I mean it would be okay if it were at home because that's like our toilet and I kind of know the germs around. but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek I just can't think about it with out cringing. college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to. I guess I'll get used to it. Its going okay so far. I mean its fun and all but I don't know. I really really miss home. Its weird not coming home to your family everyday. I've met some really cool people but I still miss my old friends. but I'm getting used to going places by myself. Woo hoo I'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom. sheehs its only been 0 minutes. I don't know how much more I can type. This is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha I am typing what I am thinking so hey. my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping. Wait I missed my favorite song on the cd. Oh well. I wish asthma were here with me. We could do some awesome stuff together. but amrita seems really cool we've had great convos. but I'm still scared to make new close friends like I loved my friends from hs. We were such GOOD friends. Making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over. Its hard for me I'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere. I feel really  alone sometimes in a room full of people but I guess that's natural. wow its only been 0 min and 00 seconds. but I shouldn't complain  this is better than doing limits in calculus. lord calculus. I'm so worried I have to do good I have to. After this I should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk. tomorrow is discussion so it shouldn't be so bad. but I'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which isn't good when I'm totally clueless. Its embarrassing. but I guess I'm not the only one. Some people didn't know the answers either. The only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if I knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. He's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though I can be boring haha. I think he feels bad for me because I'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . So many friends and places to go. I should keep my self busy so I won't get so lonely. I'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. I want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. I have second thoughts about everything I have no idea why. I wonder where my roommate went. She works out everyday. Its inspiring I should too. I'll go to the gym. Haha I'll try who knows if I actually will. I went once and really liked it but I just have to find time. It seems like I have boatloads of work. but college is good. I'll get through it. I just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. Who knows I still have at least 0 years . I'm so sleepy. 0 more minutes of this and then calculus. No time to sleep. Ooh I need to watch ORGNAME tonight. I missed last night but PROPNAME PROPNAME was there. It might of been interesting even though I'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but I think there's some validity to it. sigh. I'm going home this weekend. I'm excited. I'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. Haha that's what's cool about being Indian. parents can always find some other Indian kid to drive you home. oh well. I'm so tired there's only 0 minutes to go. This was actually cool and stress relieving. you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out. oooh asthma just imed me. I haven't talked to her in a while. damn she hangs out with matt PROPNAME now. I find that to be so freaking funny. who would of thought? anyways man all I can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha I like dreaming lately I have weird dreams last time I had this nightmare 
__label__label0      Well, this is interesting. Let's see. right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really. PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more. studious than what I'm doing. But I don't mind. Let's see. my hands have been smelling kind of funny. Like rust, almost. But I haven't touched anything rusty. Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves. Other than that, I don't really smell anything. God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now. I really want to eat. I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now. But no, I have to be a "conformist" and go when all my other friends are going. Now I have to pay for my food. And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying. Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience. I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum. Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room. We had it set at level 0, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk. Man, that was weird. I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps. The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 0, and their food is fine. Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination. Anyway. what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy. Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it. No, not that kind of sleepy. It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms. Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness. Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today. I'm so proud of my productivity today. After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my ORGNAME application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework. That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes. I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron. Whoa. Sometimes I think I work too hard. I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of. Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes. Man, I need to spit out this gum. It's like I'm chewing rubber or something. And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten. I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more. Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying. They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology. Here's the funniest one: "penia" means abnormal reduction. So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha. I can't help it, I'm still immature. Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it. But you must admit, that's a good way to remember "penia", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term. Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning. Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at ORGNAME. Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today. I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend. Let's see. six more minutes. Sorry, but I am counting down. Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent. I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy. Yes, petty jealousy. Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human. But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that. Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window. Did you know that dogs sleep about 00 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury. Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury. I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm. Or perhaps they were already warm. who knows. I definitely don't. Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time. I need to go to sleep. But no, it's only six in the evening. Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here. Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. and dream. I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams. Or maybe I don't want that. Who knows what would turn up. 
__label__label0      Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team. I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow. My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online. I do not knw why I feel so tired. I think its because I am having too much homework. I really do not like the hot weather. I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather. I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework. I really miss all my family. I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters. I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old. I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, "The king of fighters. " Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't. I am hungry. I need to go to sleep. I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy. I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week. I'm tired of sittinglike this. I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting. The lyrics from the CD "Jaguares" are so amazing. It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind. If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes. I think I am. 
__label__label1      Well, yesterday was a good day, that is until I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. I guess I was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing. I was mad at him and then hung up with him, then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him. It was just one big drama over nothing. I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean. That ofcourse made me sad, because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him. He is attending college at ORGNAME ORGNAME, the big party school, and I guess I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. He's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up. Although I haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling I've felt in such a long time. It makes me sad because I'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last. I've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more I think about it, the more I worry. Maybe that's why I was being rude to him. My fears just come out in other ways. It's so strange though because I know I can see him pretty much every weekend. I'm just so confused right now. Maybe I'm just stressed. It is my first year of college and I'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors. I just want everything to be okay. I want good grades. I want to have fun. And most of all I want to work things out with my boyfriend. I felt like crying when I got off the phone with him last night, but I held back because I didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong. When I think of my boyfriend I can only think of a future with him. I've known him a lot longer than I've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me. I know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break. I'm only 00. What are the odds of he and I actually getting married, honestly? Then it makes me think why I even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? There really is no point. On the other hand, I need to be with this boy. Life just wouldn't be the same without him. What to do? Maybe I'll just propose to him. haha, yeah right. I just want things to be okay. I just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons I am. Grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense. Anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful. Got some of my feelings out, and I've never said any of this stuff to anyone. It was like a journal. I'm glad I'm taking such a cool class. 
__label__label1      Well, I have to do this weird assignment for psychology. I think its neat, but kind of weird. that spoon full peanut butter was really good. I'm going to have to have some more later. the atkins diet is a bitch . even though you can eat all the protein you want. I still crave the bun on my buger. I was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room. god, I felt like such an idiot. then I went crazy looking for my  roommate PROPNAME cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and I Couldn't find her and I don't have her number memorized. I don't know. I felt stupid. I feel so fat. !!!! even though I'm not overweight at all I just feel fat . I have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time. I thinks obsessive compulsive or something. I feel like I always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place. I guess I always feel like I have to impress everyone. shut up PROPNAME, god she makes the most annoying sounds I've ever heard. anyway. yeah I just always feel fat. I think I way around 000 and I'm 0"0. I just want be a little bit thinner maybe 0 or 0 pounds lighter. well, I'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits, and I feel like I got to loose a few. they are awesome, but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we've just grown to be the best of friends. I'm only 00, and its weird cause one of them is 00 and the other is 00. I'm so excited cause I miss them a lot. I think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 0 hours to come and visit. when I went down a couple of weeks ago back home, they took me out to LOCNAME padre island and we all got wasted. I like it cause I can trust them and more importantly they can trust me. I have a little head ache right now. I wonder if it was the peanut butter. I hope not. I'm really thirsty. all I've been drinking is water cause of that diet. I just started it yesterday and I probably won't see any results till maybe in a few more days. I miss isaiah. I love him so much, but he's about 0 hours away and a senior in high school. I love him but the last time I went down I didn't feel the same love for him like I used to. maybe I'm just in love  with the image of him. I guess that can happen. I've been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person I am. I wanted to come to UT because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you. well, I still don't know who I am. I know that I'm sweet, kind, and talented, but there's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that I don't get into trouble. maybe everyone does that. I guess I'll never know. I 'm really glad that I have a good roommate. we are exactly alike and we get along really well. I just miss everyone from back home , but I know when pam and kristy come to visit me I'll feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and I m so in love with her music. I recently went to  a sarah mclachlan concert on july 00 this summer. now that was probably the best experience of my life. it was awesome. their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches, I think that's how you spell it. I 'm really excited to meet her cause she's hilarious. I spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and I haven't met her in person yet, but I'm looking foward to it cause she  said she likes having a good time and I'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together. I CAN'T WAIt!!!!0. I'm tired now. I haven't gotten any sleep since I'v been here, wow the times almost running out,,  
__label__label0 stream of consciousness. Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's "A Light in August"  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. I. E: when I'm trying to take a  nap. Our refrigerator is in the closet. It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. My  roommate's name is PROPNAME and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell. He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family. I think he's from LOCNAME, but I could be mistaken. PROPNAME is dating a girl named  PROPNAME and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it. It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room. Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him. Oh I hate it. I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry. God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one. Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever. My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak. He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities. But he doesn't exactly say why. And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement. Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend. We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called PROPNAME's Ranch. So we found a new camp site called LOCNAME LOCNAME and it  was really nice. So we camped there with a fire and the whole 0 yards or whatever. But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the  ground. It was pretty bad, but I made it through. Only got about 0 and a half hours of  sleep though. ughh. Oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed  to PROPNAME's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. But we didn't give up hope and  went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got  to do one route because it started to rain. So after that our hopes were pretty much shot  so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and I took a nap  that I just woke up from about 00 minutes ago. So my weekend was pretty lackluster but  it'll be ok because I know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. Oh  well. My mom just called me a second ago and I was like, "can I call you right back? I'm  doing a project" and she's so understanding and just said "bye" really quick so after I'm  done with this thingy I'll call her back. I've actually been keeping in touch with my mom  pretty well since I moved here which has been nicer than I imagined it would. I expected it  to be annoying talking to her too much but I was mistaken. I've also been talking to my  sister via email which has been fun. She's so funny and always has something to say, but  whenever I call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and I just ask for  mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. I know it's weird, but the thing I miss the most about  home is my dog. I have a full-blooded springer spaniel named PROPNAME and she's such an  awesome dog. I miss her so much, but I'm hoping that if I live in a frat house next year I  can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. Oh well, I guess we'll see 
__label__label1 What do I write about? That is a good question, but I guess I should write about writing, or think about thinking. The thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued I am at the moment. I have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and I just want to sit and do nothing. I guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. Part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. PROPNAME PROPNAME is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. I wish I were sleeping and I wish I did not have to report to the house in about 00 minutes because I just want to do nothing right now. I don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. I did not have much class today, so I got to sleep in, but I could still use some rest. Perhaps I need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. I just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. I have been in school here for about two weeks, and I think it is really quite a cool set up. You don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. Sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in Psychology, only my other classes. The biggest adjustment I think from High school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. One of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. That guy is such a mess and I was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. Let's see here, it has been 00 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. It is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. I am trying to search for thoughts, but I just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. All of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and "margaritaville. "  I wish I were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. We have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around LOCNAME. But now my hands are kind of aching because I don't think I have ever typed this long without taking a break. I am certain that I wil have great stamina in my hands when I am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. It is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days  because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. I like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. I look up at the clock and see I am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 00 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say. I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. Looks like I am  out of time.        
__label__label1 Right now I am in my room trying to study. I really don't know how to study at all. I'm way behind in all my reading cause it's so boring. PROPNAME is printing something right now. I am so bored. I want to go home tomorrow, but I'm not done with my reading so I really can't do anything until I'm done with that. Plus I don't know whose going to pick me up if I could go home. PROPNAME said he was going to find a way to come and get me, but I don't know if it's possible. They said there is this race they are going to on Sunday and I really would like to go. Gosh this seem to be forever to type. I really miss my mom, but when I'm around she's always yelling at me. I don't enjoy my time with her. Every time we get into an agrument I feel bad afterwards cause I know she might not be around for very long. I love her so  much I just wish we can hang out and do what other family does and be happy. My sister is not talking to her right now because of what happen last week and I wish it never did happen. I would be aleast happier to talk to her everyday. She seem to always cry when I do talk to her. My life seem to suck comparing to all the other people. PROPNAME is standing here right now watching me type. Right now I'm looking around room. My roommate is making me nervous, she was looking at me type. I think we need to start cleaning our room cause we have books and stuff everywhere. I miss PROPNAME, he went back to califorina for the ORGNAME and he has not called me since the last time. It's been like a week. I've been feeling a little dumb around LOCNAME cause everyone seem to be so smart. Even my friend PROPNAME feel this way. Maybe I just don't belong here with all the smart people. I'm a poor person, and it just make it worst to see that most of the people that goes here are rich. They talked about how they are going to get a piece of land and build their house and have lots and lots of parties. I don't know if I can even afford a house right now. My mom lives in an apartment and she barely make enough to pay for all the bills. I feel like I'm using all her money going here. I love her so much. She's always been here for me even if we get in fights. My life would have been better if I have my dad around. He doesn't even seem  to care if I'm alive or not. He never sent us anything. The only thing that I get from him is a child support paycheck, which I don't really care for. I need money, but it always come  and go. And it sure doesn't make me happy. Homer really likes me but I don't know him enough to go out with him. Is that bad?  For some reason I still like PROPNAME, but he's just the type of person that want girls for sex. He wanted to take me home this one day, but I said no. I don't like people looking at me like I am a hoe, because I know I'm not a hoe. My mind is blank right now. To me life just seem to suck. Isrel seem to be a non commitment person, and I wish he was because I would like to go out with him and be with him.  I guess I just like the idea that   I like him and if we get together and get marry someday he would be able to support me and make me happy. My goal right now is to  do good in school and build a great career for myself and prove to my friend's that I can graduate from UT if I try my best. They keep on telling my that I'm wasting my money going to UT because it's much cheaper when I go at home. I just always wanted to go to UT and here I am  following my dreams.  I'm trying to find a job right now but it seem so hard. So many people are searching for jobs and I'm out of luck. I think I might switch my bank to bank one because they have free checking account and the one I have with bank of america isn't free. After this I need to start reading  all of my books I wonder how far I'm going to get before I decide to go do something again. I'm almost done I have less then a minute now. I really enjoy my psychology class. It's one of the best class I have here at UT so far. I just hope I'll do good. My goal is to do good and get into the nursing major. 
__label__label1      Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about "me". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. LOCNAME LOCNAME. LOCNAME LOCNAME. The  LOCNAME LOCNAME of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with "make love" or "marry" or "help through important  issues". Certainly not "castrate. "  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. "  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when PROPNAME and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates PROPNAME PROPNAME. LOCNAME is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW PROPNAME. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call PROPNAME a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as "nigger" or "spic" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it. Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical "good people" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around LOCNAME for some god or cause might hope. That's what makes music --- done. Thanks  for the toilet! 
__label__label1      So I'm glad that this assignment is like this beacuse I love journaling and writing my thoughts down. I must have had the most unluck day ever today, and now my mom is mad at me! That sucks. Such is life!! Oh well. I hope that I do well in this class beacuse I really need to boost my gpa up this semester. I can't wait to get my papa john's pizza, I am so hungry. Man I can't wait for PROPNAME to get here tomorrow too. I miss him so much. he kind of pissed me off today though because when I was telling him about my crappy day he had to get off the phone with me. Well I giess I really shouldn't be that pissed off. I'm sure I have done it to him numerous times. that's why I like him, he put up with my BS. Wow its only been three minutes. I don't know if I can keep typing for 00. this is actually harder than I though. my mind is totally blank  right now. Well actually its not because if it was then I would be thinking anything, but I an think about how my mind is blank. so it's really not blank. Ok I think I'm making things a little complicated. oh my goodnes there is this weird noise coming from somewhere in my room. ughhhh these stupid dorms. . Mann I got to a lot of homework to do tonite. Well at least I'm getting one thing done. That's good. la la la. This is getting kind of old. I have about 00 minutes to go, whoops there is the phone I have to go get my pizza is ready. I hope I don't get counted off for this. Man I'm excited about this pizza. Mmmmm can't wait. Man I'm really excited to eat this pizza. Its going to be so good. Man the smell of it makes my mouth water. I'm going to keep writing a little more since I had to go get my pizza. I wonder if my mom called me back. I really don't want her to be mad at me because she gives me allownace on friday. Man that's bad for me to think that. but I was just kidding though. Man I love chicken pizza. Its so good. Man that was I pretty cool assignment. I think I'm going to like psych class!! 
__label__label1      Ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again. The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. I hope I don't misspell too many things. I am sniffingly so loud. I should go get a tissue. I never did learn how to type right on this thing. Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird. Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. I really wish I could concentrate for more than 0 seconds when I'm emotional. It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight. But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school. I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life. They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. Wow, LOCNAME tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails. I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. I think it's time to switch positions. Ah. Much better. Now my typing skills really stink. It's really hard to lay on the ground and type. Oh I have a laptop. That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC. I still can't get comfortable. The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. That's better. I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place. AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. Stupid back gives me problems all the time. I miss Dr. PROPNAME!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt. It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing. That might not make me look too smart. Oh, well. I don't want to go back and look at it. It would just take to long. God, my nose is still stopped up. My skin is drying out to. I need to wash my face and moisturize. I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  I had to retypr it like three times. You know for someone who is supposed to be smart, I am pretty dumb sometimes. I wonder if PROPNAME thought I was dumb in class today. I zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. I wish I could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe I could pay attention in class. But no. I have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. I seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. I was going to use a bad word, but I don't know if that would be appropriate. I wonder if it would affect my grade if I did write a cuss word. Is that how you spell cuss?  Maybe I should have just wrote curse. And why do I always have to fix the word just?  Every time I type just without paying close attention I put an extra j in between the u and the s. It makes me feel quite stupid. Time just ran out. I'm glad because I want to just go to sleep and forget about people  I will never have to see again. 
__label__label1 I am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. I like that movie 00 first dates. I said that because I'm watching t. v. oh I already said that. well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. I pray to God that she's. I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer. I watching the monk. I love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it. I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown. I am almost half way through this writing assignment. I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them. I forget how many hours I need. Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 0 hours. I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel. I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. PROPNAME is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. I hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on ORGNAME. I got to find something a little better to watch. I just changed to what not to wear. I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress. I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling. I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery. I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. I would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because          
__label__label0      ORGNAME kickoff tonight. should be fun to watch. Going to get depressed watching them play. actually probably not, but I wish I could play ball ! I played highschool football, and actually did Div,. III equivalent in LOCNAME. that was fun. This assignment is too long should be 00 minutes, not 00. I read a book that was stram off consciensness (did I spell that right?). PROPNAME, by PROPNAME wolf. I was an ORGNAME book. it ought to be fun going back to norway this winter for xmas. can't wait to see my parents and sis. and dog. coach will send me a CD with all our game footage from last season. Go domers. He said I could play whenever I was in norway. awesome. I was a badass corner back. if I was 00lbs heavier (muscle) and faster I could play for ORGNAME. It would be a frikkin dream come true. that's one regret that I have in life. maybe one of my only ones: that I will forever just be a varsity highschool ball players. or maybe not its not that big a deal I guess. can't wait til I'm flyin in the LOCNAME air force! greatest country ever!! this assignmentt is getting old. nnobody's going to read all of them anyway green mesquite bbq. Mmm I don't really want to go, but I want the bbq plus I get to see rotc people but I actually don't really want to now I want to lay in bed and watch tv play ta. too lazy I get my guitar toorrow this keyboard is hard to type on this opps this assignment is terminated 
__label__label1 Well its after classes on this Friday. I am sll freaking' stressed out. Stupid Fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. It's not that I don't know how to do it, it's just that I doubted myself. I don't know, ever since I have been here I think that I have gotten dumber, when in reality I am not. I am actually pretty damn smart. I am just letting what everyone says get to my head. So it pretty much is my fault anyway. Well from now on, I am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like I am smarter than the professor that made them. I probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. Damn I miss my girlfriend. She is like so freaking hot. Yeah I know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and I wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. She is more mature than most of the girls I have for classes and some of my close girl friends. Damn I am sneezing well I am doing this in a friends room so yeah. Well PROPNAME is hot and I miss her. Its not really a distraction. Today I was tired I have no idea why I have been sleeping more than I ever have. I don't even read for classes. College isn't even hard. I could not read and make a C in all my classes but I want A's damnit. Stupid medical school. Wish I could fast forward my life about 0 years. But I'll be a pinche viejo by then. I wonder if because I am cussing the person that reads this will think I am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality I probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. And its not like I am a big cusser. Its just I have been so damn stressed lately. I was doing my chemistry homework and I ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. Not like one or two try like 00 to 00 strands of hair. Um. went blank. Nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than I can type them out. This keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. Well, here I am in college. Everyone once in a while it sets in. They are a lot of hot girls here. I really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because I am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. I have been in love before. Went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. Four damn years. My feet stink and its driving me nuts. Its like I can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. I wonder if other people have that problem. I am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. Its probably all the bacteria on my feet. O well. Tonight I think I am going to get drunk. I have never drank before, well I have taken some sips like four. Beer tastes like shit. I am just going to drink "chick" drinks. I don't care what guys say. And if I do something stupid tonight o well, I need to wind down. I have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. O well. Sucks to be in college. You know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. In fact I would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. I know I could do that but I don't know I guess I don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. I don't think I like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. I don't like to leave things to chance. But then life has screwed me over so many times before even when I was doing all the right things so what was the point. I mean I didn't drink or do drugs I mean I tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. I love God I would go to church and like it, I would have my quiet time, I would be a pretty good Christian example till like my jr. year and what happened?  My parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did. Gosh damn I am still embarrassed of what he did. So yeah all things this I was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes I would have had it. He mad 00,000 a year and my mom made 00,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley. Its next to LOCNAME, and no we weren't drug dealers. Hah. that's funny if I hadn't put that in, you might have thought that. Nah he  
__label__label0      Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far. Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade. Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe. I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends. At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town. Good old LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there. My roommate is also from LOCNAME LOCNAME the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on. Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well. Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt. Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there. But well back to my life in college. I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it. Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper. Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP. This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend PROPNAME showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at ORGNAME's. Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and PROPNAME didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 0 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in. So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town. I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit. When I was there it was fun the first couple of 00 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates. But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose. My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving. Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give. The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast. And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer. 
__label__label0 Today was a pretty calm day. Nothing outrageous happened. Right now I feel hungry, probably because the last time I ate was at 0:00 or so and I didn't have much. I tired this new stir fry stuff and some mashed potatoes. It was ok but I guess it was only filling for the time being. I almost forgot I had this assignment due tomorrow. I sprang out of bed as soon as I remembered. earlier my suite mates and I watched a movie at the union called Mean Girls. It was good and they showed it for free too so there were a lot of people there. They show a lot of movies at the union. The next dorm family event planned for us is to go and watch the movie Troy. My roommate's friend is going to make her and I watch the movie schindler's list sometime soon. He is a big movie fan and is going into the college of communication and he wants to be a director later on. He has already made a movie. He made it in high school and he went around and just videotaped the different events and people at school. My roommate said it was good. She just told me that her chemistry professor wrote the book they use in class. Its not just him but he has contributed to writing the book. He has his name on the cover of the book and everything. I'm going home to LOCNAME next weekend to see my family and to attend this bayou bhangra competition that all my friends are going to. Its going to be really fun. I can't wait to see my baby sister she's just too cute for me. I love her and she's a miracle baby too especially because she serviced through my mom's accident and all the medication my mom had to take during her pregnancy. But I guess that's God's love and blessing and I am very thankful for everything he as done for me and my family but I don't know what to think of him after my aunt and uncle's freak accident and death. I don't understand why he sends us these extraordinary people and then just takes them away from us before its time for them to go. I don't know I suppose its just one of those things that happen and can't be explained. And I believe that things happen for a reason but I don't know how God can justify their death and all these things that have been happening to our entire family. Things haven't seem to be right ever since my grandmother passed away. Well that's all I can think of to write about and its time now too, how convenient. Bye 
__label__label1 well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about. I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down. it probably will. like, I knew this would happen. I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it. my back itches. I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach. I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it. I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying "no", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was. my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class. I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately. I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time. my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me. when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything. now she is always getting mad at me for everything. she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says "where the fuck are you going". I never get mad at her for things she does to me though. I have infinite almost patience with her. she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 0 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says "fuck PROPNAME, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit". I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much. we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to. I have economics to do. 
__label__label0 So school has been interesting so far. I've come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like, and I've surprised myself to find that it would be completely different. At the time, I have become increasingly known by a nickname that wasn't even self imposed, I've created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to. People love "dat PROPNAME PROPNAME" but hey. I guess I'm not too mad about it. it's good in the end, in some ways, and in some ways not. like for example, if I want people to know who I am, then they really do know who I am, and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way, but on the other hand, since people think they know who I am they won't bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who I am. really who am I anyway?  can it be defined by a label or name?  does it matter if I am PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME, or PROPNAME Boi Tony. because some people can remember my name at all. I guess in some facets it really is irrelevant, but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant. lol. it's like significance drives us, like a since of purpose, much like Agent PROPNAME from the Matrix, but that movie was flawed in itself. It had no purpose. It started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end,  but that just didn't work. However PROPNAME PROPNAME, did it right when I he made PROPNAME PROPNAME,  it was a simple plot with a unique character development, and that was the important part. many people thought that it was the action, but it truly was the characters that made the movie. that's why vol. 0 is better than vol. 0, no matter what the next person tells you. sure vol. 0 was composed of the best action sequences since the old PROPNAME PROPNAME days (who is still better than PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME), but the story itself is what should draw you. on another note, a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see, and now he's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care. The problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind, but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature. he can't take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself, the thinks he is fine as who he is. Emo SUX though. I had no formulated opinion about it until I seen what it is doing to him. he needs help. for real. the funniest part about it, is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting PROPNAME. "God is Dead. "  which is a very interesting quote. a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion. if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason. they are a tool, if they inject reason and use logic to prove why God is alive. then they are less of one. the point is, that the religious texts, such as the Koran, the Bible, etc. were written by man (inspired by God), which means they are subject to flaws. inherently and maybe intentionally,   if you could tell the people "thus said the lord" and you didn't want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish. then that's what you'd tell them. after all some people read from texts translated by PROPNAME. but I digress. I as a ORGNAME would only have this much to say in return. if God is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed. And if he truly is God and did exist,  Death has no binding power. defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic. What is death, what is death to a man, what is death to a beast, what is death to a god. And then I would say. yes, God in the form of man (Jesus) did die, for you and I. there's always a way to explain something in the logical realm, however some people are too closed minded to see even that. Sometimes, philosophy, even pomo philosophy, can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe. and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory. that persons faith has become that much stronger. Well. yester I went to a labor day cookout. and there were some fine ladies there. You never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you. that's the funny part about it all, I don't try that hard enough. I just wonder what other people's perception is of me. could I have had a chance with any of those girls, probably, but not likely. and this is where my reckoning begins. what are these girls looking for. attention? relationships?  or just good sex?   I could provide them with all 0, but hey there's only a small amount of me to go around. all jokes aside, with the truth being told, I really think attention is the centric thing that girls want. how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story, because girls are all so different. but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail. and I like to look at detail. that's why I think I might be staying single for a while. even as hard as that is in a place like ORGNAME ORGNAME.
