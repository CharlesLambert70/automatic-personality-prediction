__label__label0 I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if I’m just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because LOCNAME is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate LOCNAME. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 0 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 00 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell can’t I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think I’ll just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. 
__label__label1 this is by far one of the most interesting assignments I have ever had to do  not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time I have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. I am very hungry right now and I could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. I am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, I guess they need this many to accommodate 00. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. I am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons ORGNAME has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. I am actually thinking of being a psy major. I think I may double major with a BA in music and another liberal arts degree . I sure am glad I switched out of my performance major. I just didn’t want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path I was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 00 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because I bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. I wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. I don’t want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least I know what to expect. I am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. I think the radio show went well last night  I hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we don’t look so incompetent. I don't think I spelled that right. just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten. probably why they don’t hire people right out of fourth grade. my roommate’s hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple. I told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity. that word is soooo overused and really annoying. sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card. we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing. this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 00 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this, I apologize for the sloppy spelling, bad grammar and weak syntax. I guess that's what being a TA is all about, huh? 
__label__label1 Well, my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME I am now thinking about what I am thinking. I am thinking about Physics. Physics is hard because I have never taken a class in it and the first one I am taking is a college course. Another thing I am thinking about is how long these lines are and how much of a page am I really writing. Did you guys set it up this way on purpose to see something or to tell something about us. Well, if you want to know something that I am feeling right now is that these lines really annoy me by being so long. That is o. k. cause I will just deal with it. I am also thinking about my home and what my girlfriend is doing. If she misses me and other things about her. I am missing her. Studying here is tough and so are the classes. But hopefully that will just make me learn more. There are two girls next to me and they are talking alot. Usually I get people next to me in the computer lab that talk in French and Spanish so I don't know what they are saying and it does not bug me as much. Finally the end of the abnormal typing line. Well, I can understand what these girls are talking about and I don't even really care but they are still distracting me from providing a researchable paper. It really does not annoy me that much but, I like perfect situations and that means everything goes my way. Unfortunately that does not always happen. Guess what they just left. It is really quiet and I can think lots better. Well, since I have been in college I have thought about the future more. Does everyone think about the future more in college. I bet the majority does. I am really worried about how everything is going to work out after college if there is an after college. I would like to become a big success and become a great doctor but so would a million other people and I know there is not room for a million other people which narrows the picking for medical school. I will just do my best and the hope the best comes of it. Nobody knows though what will happen. This is pretty neat turning in a paper on the computer. Finally another line. I am going to try to pick up another class because I need more hours. I hope I can get something that will help me maximize my time here. My counselors said that I can only take 00 hours which is nice advice but who has to go to school here them or me. I would like to get out of here as soon as possible. Not because I don't like it, but just cause I am eager to see what I will be in the future, a success or a complete failure. Well, 00 minutes is up and I have to confess that I have been correcting my grammatical mistakes just cause I feel better if I do. I hope you understand. Bye.         
__label__label0 I hate computers. I think I hate them because I do not understand them. This assignment is hard because I am trying not to think about the assignment and just write about what is in my head. Why is this just continuing on one line?  Am I doing this wrong?  Should I fix the grammatical errors that I make?  I feel stressed I have only been here for a couple weeks. What could I possibly be stressed about?  I need to talk to PROPNAME. I need to talk to him tonight. This is a time in my life where I am supposed to try new things, meet new people, further my education. I do not need a serious boyfriend now. Why is he so nice?  Did he see this coming?  Is he trying to make this harder for me?  No. What am I talking about?  He is always this nice. He is such an incredible guy. Bad timing. This always happens to me. I will not miss experiences in college like I did in high school because of some guy. I need to see what it is like not having some guy around me all the time. PROPNAME might be right. I might be afraid of being by myself. I will talk to him tonight. I probably will not. How can I possibly be mean to someone who is so wonderful?  He won't understand. I know this is the best thing for me. I need to learn how to operate e-mail. I want to start sending mail to my brother. PROPNAME better come to LOCNAME to see me soon. My sister better come soon, too. I cannot believe that the one weekend I really want to go home (homecoming) I have to stay here and be formally initiated into my sorority. It is PROPNAME's birthday. I am so Jealous that PROPNAME gets to go see everyone and I will not. We have been talking about how fun that weekend will be since homecoming last year. This sucks. Everyone will be home. I wish the girls in this dorm were a little more considerate. They see me studying in here and they are still so loud. I hope I do not do the same thing. I am having so much fun here, yet I am still stressed about maintaining my friendships with my best friends from home. I hate it that one of my best friends is here in LOCNAME. It puts such a damper on our friendship. I am just so busy right now. I never realized how much time this sorority would take up. Am I neglecting one of best friends?  Does she resent the fact that I am making new friends?  I love that girl. With everyone else, we know why we haven't seen one another. PROPNAME. What am I going to do?  I am having to talk myself into doing this. I know I need to see what it is like to date other people. I think PROPNAME has something to do with this. I think PROPNAME is so wonderful because PROPNAME was so horrible. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing. I wonder if he is ended up going SAE. I wonder if he has a girlfriend. I wonder if he is a possessive weirdo to her. Why do I care?  No, PROPNAME is wonderful. Am I going to regret this?  What if he starts dating someone else and it breaks my heart. I need to do this. I am so far behind. I need to learn a little about time management. I think I am getting sick. I keep feeling like I am about to sneeze. I need to quit smoking. I would like to smoke right now. Why do I think when I am stressed that a cigarette will make me feel better. I should talk my father into buying me a computer for Christmas. I think that would be a good idea. I am going to be here for a while. I really need to start thinking of what it is that I want to do. Am I taking pointless classes?  Do I always ask myself questions?  I was really insulted by those stupid papers that basically said that I was in the lowest percentile of students at this university. I have to do well this year. I need to get my act together. It is so hard to just sit in my room and study. I should probably spend more time at the library. What could I be distracted by there?  I am asking myself too  many questions. I need some sleep. I think I am going to sneeze again. I hate that feeling.           
__label__label0 I am feeling kind of nervous today because I only have one class and I am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. I also wonder why I have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges?  In any event I know that I have to go over there and it will not be fun. I am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time I have physically seen them since I moved down here. Also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit LOCNAME and I am excited that I will be able to see her. People told me that I would be overwhelmed when I came down here but I haven't felt that way yet. Things are getting harder by the week, but I think I am handling it well. My room is a mess and I really need to clean it up and do the laundry. I guess I will today since I will have maybe a little free time. 
__label__label1 I don't really understand. I am supposed to track my thoughts and feelings?  Write about anything as long as it is for twenty minutes?  OK. I kind of miss my old life at home, but I was so looking forward to moving on to other things. I have a friend that just went into the ORGNAME last month and I will never see him again. Other friends have gone off to college and moved away. Life is starting to change a great deal. I work for a company called ORGNAME selling ORGNAME, or at least I did this summer, and we had conventions every now and then. I would always make friends from around the country, but end up never seeing them again. People don't keep in touch with each other like they should. I try to stay in touch with my friends and people that I meet. It is often difficult, though. I don't know. I am really thirsty right now. I was thinking of going up to my room first to get a drink, but I didn't figure they would let you bring drinks in here, and I didn't want to wait to get this done. I have waited long enough. I need to stop putting things off. I need to get things done. I guess it is just lack of motivation. Well that and lack of a computer. This is the first time I have been in the computer lab here at Jester. I am really thirsty and my throat is dry. I need to get this e-mail thing worked out. I haven't tried to use it yet. I might do that when I am finished with this. I wish that things could be the way they were, but then I don't. You know how sometimes something happens and you just want to freeze that moment in time and never leave. That has happened to me recently. Not since I have been at LOCNAME, but before, when I was with my friends. I like to spend time with my friends because they make me feel comfortable. I like to be around them because it is just very uplifting. My arm is starting to get tired because I don't have the right kind of writing area. It is uncomfortable in here. I need to go get a drink, but I still have a lot of time to keep writing, so I won't. I wish I had a computer so I could get things done on my own time. Life would be a whole lot easier, I think. I think I should go home and see my dog before the neighbors try to steal him again. If I don't pay enough attention to him he goes to stay at the neighbors house. They decided one day that they liked him and they were just going to keep him. They tried to give me an ultimatum (I don't know how to spell that word). They said that if I didn't give them the dog, then they did not want him at their house anymore, but if I didn't want the dog they would take him. The whole situation didn't make any sense to me, but what do I know. I don't think that they had the right to ask for my dog. He is MY dog. Whatever. Needless to say, I didn't give them the dog, but I got him fixed and had to tie him up for a while. He eventually learned that he had to stay at home, or at least near our house if he didn't want to be tied up. It rained yesterday for the first time in a long while. It didn't rain much, though. I missed most of the lightning the other night because I don't have a real window in my room. It is just like a quarter of a window and it gives me the feeling that I am in a dungeon. I hate my room. I wanted to get a plant, but then I realized that there wouldn't be enough light to keep it alive, so I axed that idea. I wish there would be a big storm because I like to watch the storms. The lightning, thunder, rain, and winds are really relaxing. My parents are building a house, but it is taking them forever. Anyway, you can sit on the back porch of the house and watch the rain. It is very nice. My friends PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME are at LOCNAME and I was just thinking about PROPNAME's yard and how nice it is. I bet it is really nice out there after it rains. The other night I watched a meteor shower and that was really beautiful. I like to look at the stars, but I dropped Astronomy because everyone said that it was really hard and that all it was a lot of math like distances to stars. I didn't feel like taking a math class so now I am taking Physical Anthropology. I don't know. My twenty minutes is up now so I am going to quit writing and submit this because I am sure it is really boring anyway. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this. My wrist hurts. Ha. 
__label__label0 I am at work right now but I don’t start to work until about 00 more minutes I wonder if any one is  going to if anyone is going to ask me what I am doing oh well there is this person that I think is real nice so I cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so I guess ill start to press enter when I cant see the words I am typing  I feel like laughing I don’t really know why well I do but it would be  to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see I wish I could go  home I just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. I still like the class though  cant wait fort he day to be over. I is supposed to rain today I want it to but I don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard I cant type as quick as my mind thinks I'm not sure I like this computer either well I’m still skipping my thoughts  on the next assignment I think I better write it down instead. ok the truth  I did erase something from the beginning of this document. I’m at work for goodness sakes. why do I keep putting periods down I guess it is hard to  write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok I've got to stop that oh well I didn’t know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what I was doing I wish I had more time to write some more poems I will though I really want to perfect the one I wrote about the tanut this I going to look crazy when they print it out. I like this assignment though I never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn’t have enough speed to get everything on the net on  my computer I rally want to  buy some more software for it but I don’t know if I can afford it so this guy that I was telling you about is so fine I feel like I want to jump his bones I even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn’t even sexual so I wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings I hope my TA gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy I have a boy friend thought it will be five years in November I don’t believe it I love him though ok my mind has gone blank I cant think of anything I wish that when I write paper that the information I need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so I could write a complete 00 page paper in one day I guess I would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday I should have been writing my thoughts down I actually because aware became aware of what I was thinking it was kind of weird why to I keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow I bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment I wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if I did know. naked why I don’t know so one to the next topic my the way I wasn’t taking bout the Winston cigarette ads you know I don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until I have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that I do I won't be doing it for the rest of my life though I do know that for sure actually I’m not sure I know what I want to do bye. 't be doing it for                            
__label__label1 Well, here goes. I'm in my room right now and it's very warm. My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. PROPNAME came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish PROPNAME could stay here with me in LOCNAME. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. PROPNAME say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can I’m restricted to because of my boyfriend PROPNAME. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at PROPNAME because PROPNAME wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. PROPNAME doesn't like the thought of me and PROPNAME spending time  together. He's weird like that. PROPNAME should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. PROPNAME is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. PROPNAME doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 0th. PROPNAME's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that I’ll be going to the renaissance festival  with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. PROPNAME  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into PROPNAME. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If y’all read this y’all will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked PROPNAME. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again PROPNAME can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love ORGNAME. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  I’m partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. It’s resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. PROPNAME left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to PROPNAME. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with PROPNAME in LOCNAME. We went to ORGNAME with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. 
__label__label0   I am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow  of my thoughts its about 0:00 in the morning the day of the first UT football  game that was successfully won by the Horns my roommate is sleeping right now  it seem that he sleeps almost 00 hours a day it makes me mad that for some  reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. All he does every day  is go to class, which I guess I should give him credit for that, and when  class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things  or he lays in bed and watches TV or movies all day he is not that social  either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any  intramurals. He doesn't study whatsoever I guess I am just worried about  him because I care about him I mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. It seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type  and I was the reclusive type and about since the 00th grade the situation has  taken a 000 degree turn I hope they televise the 00er game that they are  playing against the Rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate  thinks that the 00er don't have a prayer I believe that this opportunity will  be a coming out party for PROPNAME PROPNAME and the emergence of PROPNAME PROPNAME the  last rookie quarterback to start for the ORGNAME was PROPNAME PROPNAME hopefully a  good sign I am also kind of disappointed that I am not able to join the  professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings  when I have my CH000 extension course from 0 to0:00 PM but hey looking at the  positive side I have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is  great to be alive I feel like I am on top of the world everything is working  like clockwork I feel like watching Disney movies well it's about 0 o'clock  so I guess that I should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me  tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - :      
__label__label1 I've decided that I want to write for travel and leisure magazine. I love to write. I think I am pretty good at it too. My brother went back to LOCNAME to interview for a job with a real estate agency. He want s to be a commercial realtor. No matter what my brother decides to do he will be really successful. I'm not saying that I am a psychic or anything like that, but I know how badly my brother wants to be successful, and when he wants something, he goes out and gets it. PROPNAME and I have become much closer as I have gotten older. He is being so nice to me since I got to LOCNAME too. I think he is realizing that I am not such a bad kid after all. He always tells me to be careful and look out for myself because he won't always be in LOCNAME to take care ORGNAME me. My brother and my dad look a lot alike too. my dad is really tall: Six feet seven inches tall to be exact. H played basketball in high school, but he wasn't good enough to play in college. I think that is why he always pushed my brother to play so much that he drove PROPNAME away from the sport. I played field hockey in high school. If I didn't come to The ORGNAME of ORGNAME, I was going to try to play field hockey at a division one school. I'm really happy with the decision I made though. I am having so much fun here. I really miss my family, or, I guess you could say, lack thereof, in LOCNAME. I miss my mom and my step-dad, and my dad. My brother told me that he was so much happier when he moved to Austin. I could tell too because he didn't come home very much his freshman year. I don't think my brother likes my mom very much because whenever he comes home, they fight. I think my brother is still bothered by the divorce. I never gave myself a chance to be bothered, so I think now that I am away from home and I have all of this time to think, the divorce is starting to bother me. I wonder what parent's weekend is going to be like. I guess I'll ask my brother what he did when both of our parent's showed up ready and willing to steal him from the other parent. I will just divide up the weekend: one parent gets me one night, and the other parent will get me the next night. What is sad, is that I want to get them the whole weekend: both parents on both nights. I hate it when my friends' parents are around because it makes me think of how I can't have my real family back together ever again. By the way, I have a terrible habit of feeling sorry for myself. Things could be so much worse. I feel really lucky to be able to attend college, live where I live, have both parents who love me, be blessed with so much athletic ability. I know I am lucky, but every now and again I like to play the victim. My boyfriend is the best friend I could ever have. He always wants me to feel like I can talk to him, but he never lets me make excuses for myself if you know what I mean. He always reminds me that everyone has their hardships, but those who choose to overcome their hardships instead of letting their hardships overcome them, those are the ones who end up being happy. Twenty minutes is up! 
__label__label1 To think about what life has become can be kind of scary. I wish I had a penny for every time I was about to mess up and I think I would be a very rich woman. If I only knew at 00 what I now know at almost 00, I could have saved myself alot of pain and confusion. Then couldn't we all have?  I get scared sometimes when I think about today, two weeks from now and even years from now. The future is a very scary thing especially when you don't know what it could bring. I wish I hadn't made some of the choices I've made but those are over and done with aren't they. The only thing I need to learn how to do now is to learn from my mistakes. I feel really bad sometimes because I try to force my ideas and ideologies on those younger than me but I feel older and wiser than my years. I feel alot older than 00 sometimes yet I think, " hey I'm only 00, I have so much life to live"  Yet I'm scared to live that life. I wish I could just go with the flow instead of worry about every choice I make all the time. Even when I go with the flow I don't know what I'm doing and then I worry about what could happen after the fact. Another thing that really bothers me is the whole concept of love. What is it and how do I know if I've found it or not. When I was 00 I knew alot more about love than I do now. Why do I ramble on so, it is the same dilemma and the same problems I face every single day. I really should just give up and go with the flow. not worry about things so much. Life's too short to worry right,. All I'm doing is stressing myself out over nothing. Stress is not something I should have in my life. My whole world is sheltered and taken care of and paid for. What do I really have to worry about. Not that my dad doesn't have stipulations on what I do but it is all basically taken care of with no questions asked. Life shouldn't be that easy right?  Maybe that's why I continue to torture myself with these unnecessary dilemmas. I'm one of those drama people to I need drama in my life, something always going on or I get bored. I need conflict but not too much because then I get way too stressed out. I just don't know what to do with daddy's little girl who seems really messed up in the head,  There I go again creating drama, I'm not really messed up but sometimes I try to convince my self that I am to try to get counseling or something. I think it's a hidden Freudian issue. I should have had counseling when I was a child but I never got it because I didn't really need it. Maybe I was really traumatized as a child and now it's coming out subliminally. Ok enough kelly, this is not like you. I really don't think all of this I just do sometimes. Who knows  I sure as hell don't. My dog is so cute now. too bad I don't live with him. I want to be taken care of pampered in a way, just plain babied. That's what should happen for women isn't it. No we should be strong and independent but I don't really feel that way. I would love to live a life similar to my mom's. She isn't as taken care of as I would like to be but my daddy does all right by her. Who knows what life will bring maybe I will quit thinking about it. oh. the clock on my computer says I've been typing for twenty minutes. Cool this is a really good stress reliever and I really felt like I was talking to someone. Cya 
__label__label0 College seems very stressful. It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 00000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs LOCNAME. The attitude of "wanting to learn " is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess PROPNAME tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is "Greatness courts failure"  I don’t think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw PROPNAME in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the PROPNAME PROPNAME '00 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in LOCNAME when PROPNAME was released (Didn’t happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was PROPNAME PROPNAME, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though 
__label__label1 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am thrilled!!! to be here at LOCNAME. I've always loved PROPNAME ever since I visited here when I was younger speaking of which I have been feeling like I was a little kid lately because I am in a new place with new people everything is new. Sometimes new is fun like in relationships. new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another. Like my roommate and I are VERY  tired of each other right now. Every little thing she does annoys me and I am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits. I have several annoying ones. My boyfriend says he has not found any, but that leads back to the whole newness thing. He doesn't quite know me. and I'm not quite sure I want him to . I want some ORGNAME's right now because I am starving I haven't eaten since this morning because I have been running all over campus getting things done. I went to a meeting for the Pom squad tryouts and I had a memory rush from high school The chick who is the director is one of my old drill team director's friends and lets just say I don't like to think of drill team much. Although it seems to be on my mind alot lately because I have been questioning weather or not I should be in LOCNAME or not. I am really truly happy for PROPNAME and brooke and PROPNAME, but I can't help but be envious. I know PROPNAME is loving shoving this in my face but I wish she wouldn't Why can't we just be friends again like we were last year all of this other crap had to start and now its finished kind of. I guess not totally finished because I am still stringing Earl along. I don’t  mean to be so selfish but I like having someone there for security. I have always been given security from my parents and I am used to that feeling I miss my parents they do so much for me like my mom getting this new job one that I don't even know if she likes just to make more money so I can go to UT. My sister loves to spend my parents money and I am finding out how easy it is when you're far from home and you don't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us. I can not even fathom what having a child must be like sometimes I want to have children and get married and settle down and other times I don't want any of that mushy stuff. That is kind of what Earl is there for. Incase I decide to pursue the romantic side in me which I seriously doubt so I should just let him go and I am really bad at typing I used to be better but I guess I am a little out of practice I tool 0 typing classes in high school which I had a nice time in we have such an awesome senior class. I was so proud but now everybody is gone off to do their own thing I can't spell either I have always had that problem ever since I was little my whole family makes fun of me for it especially my sister. I wonder how long I have been typing I haven't typed like this since staying up all night writing and typing my senior research paper on PROPNAME. I love Ms. PROPNAME she was a great teacher I wonder how heather is doing in LOCNAME I should call her tonight and see if she likes her class. It would be awesome to live in LOCNAME the Indigo girls are from LOCNAME LOCNAME and I have always wanted to go there and see their home town I think where people are from say alot about them. like my cousin is from LOCNAME and she a real heavy accent her whole family does I hope she is ok. She went a little crazy after her father died, but who wouldn't my mother is crazy. poor woman is going through so much right now and PROPNAME has to be feeling the same way with both of her daughters moving out at the same time. 
__label__label0 I just got off ORGNAME with my best friend form back home I get to go back to see her this weekend her family loves me her mom wants us to get married one of these that would be cool with me she’s hot I don’t know though cause I still really like my ex girlfriend we have talked a lot since I came here she goes to school in LOCNAME we broke up but we have still dated on and off I really miss her I don’t miss many of my other friends too much that s ok I am watching Sniffled while I do this I love this show it is the funniest I love school here except it is always busy I passed up on a frat party to do this and cause I got to work at 0 am I cant afford to go any longer with out sleep it has been a week since I got more than 0 hours of sleep I think ill sleep early tonight I will ask one of my friends form back home to our pledge party this weekend I'm an ORGNAME were number 0 on campus in ratings what are ratings any way nothing this girl is hot I wanted her for a long time in kingwood but I never really got far with her she is an a d pi they are a big sorority here I'll ask her tomorrow I think but she has a boyfriend I want some taco bell it is my favorite food I ate Mexican food for 0 nights in a row I haven’t had any for z 
__label__label0 Here I am doing psychology homework. I should be watching late night television. PROPNAME is just now coming on I missed all of PROPNAME. PROPNAME is the best late night talk show personality. I need to call PROPNAME, I wonder if she's still out she has that 00 o'clock curfew. Is the time zone the  same here as it is in LOCNAME? I'll have to ask her when I call . I hate typing  I'm not very good at it  but I've had a lot of practice lately since I've started E-mailing frequently. Yes Only thirteen minutes left. I feel sorry for anyone who has to read this because it is a very jumbled stream of consciousness. Tomorrow I have to get up early for Calculus. It stinks that my earliest class is the one that is the hardest to sit through anyway. I don't like Tuesdays  (or Thursdays) for that matter because I have to get up early and don’t get back from rugby practice until  after nine or so and then I 'm too tired to do anything else but sit around moan and watch TV. Eight minutes left I'm over the hump. the view from my room when the moon is full reminds me of PROPNAME PROPNAME's Starry Night with the tower lit up and all, it helps if I have my contacts out though. everyone I know has gone out and partied this  week except for me . I wonder if doing this at midnight counts as tomorrow for turning it in . Because I'll probably try to do the other assignment in about twenty two or twenty three hours. my wrist is starting to hurt I wonder if it's from typing or if it's from falling on it  this weekend. I need more posters for my side of the room to brighten it up because its kinda boring. Oh yeah I just ran out of my twenty minutes but I'm still typing  I think Lucky Charms brainwashes little kids into thinking that they are eating something special by changing the size shape and colors of their marshmallows al the time. 
__label__label1 Ok. Stream of. "Come as you are. I wonder if anybody actually misses PROPNAME PROPNAME. "No I don't Have a gun"?  What? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named Nirvana, whose leader shot himself. ORGNAME ORGNAME, much better group. I wonder how many people have killed themselves because of PROPNAME PROPNAME death. That takes intelligence. PROPNAME's dead, life's not worth living. Why did I wait till the day before this is due to type it. Ohhhhhh I love this song. It reminds me of my boyfriend and I. "When she says she loves me". except I don't say I love him because according to every one of my friends I'm afraid to tell him I love him. Something about a fear of commitment and love. I guess it's all supposed to be ORGNAME’s fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. " When she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love". Good song. I wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. Oh yah, classic Sting. I have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. I never really liked Sting anyway. I should really be doing my other homework. What do I have to do? English paper, read my classic civilization, read my English, study Psy notes, and phl notes. I guess I can do most of it tomorrow. Third Eye Blind. Where do they get names for these groups?  Tomorrow is another day{Go PROPNAME}. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. At least I have a decent boss for once, not some 00 year old pervert. what time is it? Wow 00 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. I wish they were all that easy. Yah right. That probably wouldn’t get me into ORGNAME ORGNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME, four more years of college. Hopefully I can get through these first four. I can do it, because I’m good enough I'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. Well it's been a great 00 min. I'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. I need to do these more than a day before their due next time. 
__label__label0 Wow, I really don't know what to write. All I know is that I'm kinda behind on  my studies. The bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of  school. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this, but I just can't seem to help it.  That's why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute. Bad, huh?   Hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. I just took  a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. I have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. I really miss my boyfriend. The funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that I'm Vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. Well his father is black and his mom is half Arabic and half French. My boyfriend,  PROPNAME, was born in LOCNAME but moved to LOCNAME when he was only one years old. He's lived there for the past 00 years or so and have been here in the U. S for only two  years. He speaks five different languages. Pretty impressive, huh?  I have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I miss him sooo much. I wonder if he misses me or not. What do you think?  My problem is that  I'm not calling him until he calls me first. That's just the way I am. The guy always has to make the first move. I guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. I really hope he will call soon. I really, really miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. If my parents ever find out I'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely FREAK!  That's how they are. Actually, that's how  I kinda was. I told myself I would never ever like anyone but Asian guys. Boy, was I wrong. You know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. For some  reason, I'm sitting real straight up in my seat. I never do this when I'm just  typing for the heck of it. Maybe the fact that I know this is for a grade makes  me a bit uneasy. Oh well, I don't mind. There, I kinda sat back a bit and it  feels a little bit better now. I just yawned. great, I need to stay up kinda  late tonight to do some other homework. I have ten more minutes but I don't know what else to write. I guess I type kinda fast, and so it seems as though I'm  writing a whole lot, huh?  I don't know how you are going to grade this. I know  it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. I  bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh?  NO, I'm just kidding. . Oh, Oh, OH, OH, yeah, yeah. I love you more than I can say. , I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, Oh, OH, I love you more than I can say. OH, don't you know I  need you so, OH tell me please, I gotta know. Do you mean to make me cry?  Am I just another gal,  That was just a song that I usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. How do you like it?  It's kinda funny how sometimes I think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, I think I'm the ugliest troll. Why is that?  One day I would have complete confidence in myself and the next day I would feel so small and vulnerable. Why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially Asian guys. Well, I kinda know the answer to that question. Since I'm Asian and I want to meet an Asian guy, I tend to feel more self conscience when I'm  around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. I've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. Because I don't really see them as a potential romance interest, I am very relaxed and calm with them, and I guess we just click like that. I know I should do the same with Asian guys, but it's hard just b/c they're Asian, also. Why is it so complicate, man?  Well, tomorrow, my friend PROPNAME and I are gonna take a bus to the mall. I've only been on the  bus twice here around campus. I've never taken a bus on a highway before. I  have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. Wish me luck. Man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! Isn't that weird?  Okay, I'm gonna stop Bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .              
__label__label0 At his time I am at the lab listening to everyone in here typing and some coughing as well. The laser printer doesn't seem to stop printing. I am at the ORGNAME ORGNAME lab doing this assignment. I am wondering whether or not I will be going home, LOCNAME, next week on Friday. I am hoping my friend will take me. I also hope I can bring back my sister, who is presently in LOCNAME, so that she can live with us. That way I don't have to worry about cooking or getting food for dinner. I am glad my Pre Calculus professor gave me permission to take my midterm on Monday, the day after I get back from LOCNAME--If I go. I just looked at the proctors. They are helping some people out with their passwords. I wish I could get a job as a proctor. I think that would be an easy way of getting some money. Most of them don't even know what they are doing. I just thought about my major. I hope I can get into the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in Advertising. That would be really neat since I like to do stuff like that. I just read that a lot of students in advertising have earned awards. But I just looked at some of their work and I don't think it would be all that hard to do. I just looked at my watch, I have about fifteen more minutes before I can send this message. A lot of people are leaving the lab know. That stinks, I wish their was a better computer when I got here. Right now I'm stuck with this old ORGNAME comp. --the only one in the lab that's still using Windows 0. 00. I wish I was home with my family right now. Especially since they left for LOCNAME today. If only I didn't have school right now, then I could live at home and help my dad with our family business. A lot of these computers in here are down. It sure would help if someone would fix them. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME--so that's who this building is named after. Who is he?  I've never heard of him. The sign on the wall says, "Lumberman, Banker, Publisher, Statesman. "  What does that have to do with Communications(except "Publisher"). I still have to do my rough draft for English. Oh well, I will probably do it tonight when I get home. Not like I can get any work done their. My brother is too loud and annoying. He doesn't let me study in peace. He is pretty stubborn--likes to have everything his way. Just because my parents aren't here, he thinks he's my guardian or something. I wish I lived in a dorm instead. That would have been cool. That way I could have met new people and friends. Not only that, it's right there on campus and they have cafeterias. That would help a lot. Now I only have six minutes to go. This thing is taking a pretty long time. If it weren't for this assignment I could have been working on my English paper right now. I hope that paper turns out good. At least my professor liked my proposal-he said I did an "excellent job. " In class he was saying how rare that case would be. Hopefully, I'll do well in this class. I really don't like English classes. Their so boring. All you do is discuss a lot of things, write papers, and practice grammar. I thought my English class would be very large, instead it ends up having only 00 people. I hate small classes. At least all my other classes have over one hundred people. Well, I'm done. I guess I will send now. 
__label__label1 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wonder how many people will start out this writing by stating their name. it seems the logical thing to do since they have just finished typing it and therefore will be thinking about it. I wonder if this assignment is some kind ORGNAME study that our professor is doing. he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and what makes them tick. I wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment. how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line?  I would really like to have access to these writings. I bet it will fascinating to see what people will put down. can any of this be used against me in a court of law?   I am having a great deal of trouble making my computer operate correctly. that is why I am writing this assignment in the basement of jester instead of in the comfort of my own room on the 00th floor. I am worried about having to run down that many steps if there is a fire. the thought of burning to death does not scare me as much as the thought of drowning. that is odd since I am an excellent swimmer and even have worked as a lifeguard. the summer I guarded, I had nightmares about drowning. I don't want to think/write about that anymore. I wonder if PROPNAME write his article for the Texan. I wonder if PROPNAME is mad about the letter I wrote him. relationships are very hard sometimes. I have two hard relationships. one with PROPNAME and one with PROPNAME. gabe is hard to relate at times too. I like PROPNAME more now that I don't have to live with her. I wish that I could just be normal where PROPNAME is concerned. actually that is the problem: I am normal. I am tired of this. I swam laps today. exercise is very good for self-esteem, not because it makes you look better although it does)it just makes you feel better about yourself. I wonder if there is a hormone released when you work hard at something that makes you feel good about yourself. this seems like such a waste of time. I glad to help professor pennebaker get tenure though.  
__label__label1 It is now 0:00 PM, that means I have to do this stupid assignment until 0:00. it's probably beneficial for the psychologists at this school, though. I think I am going off the page now so I will press return okay, that line was probably fucked up but that's okay. I wonder how long it will take to get on a computer tomorrow. It didn't take too awfully long today. I used to be able to type faster than this, I think. I  am out of practice from summer. I can't write as well, either. not that I was very good to begin with. This is going to seem like a really long time. I was going to say take a long time, but it's only twenty minutes, which doesn't seem like that long in theory, but it really is. I am not looking at the screen and my writing is going everywhere. I wonder what the other people said, and if they noticed that this thing doesn't automatically scroll down as you type. It's good to do this on the internet because it saves a lot of paper waste, but it's annoying to have to come here and wait for a computer when I’m used to just writing things on paper at home. I wonder if PROPNAME had emailed me yet-- I will check on that after I finish this thing. Doh!- It's only 0:00. I have a really long time. I wonder if he can tell whether or not people cheat and cut it short. if you can type really fast then you can get a lot done. I wonder how fast I type in comparison with everyone else. I should have learned how to touch type before I came to college. I still use the hunt and peck version staring at the keyboard. It's hard to do that when you're transcribing a paper or something that you aren't thinking of as you go. I'm getting tired. This reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa is rambling on and on and nobody is listening or cares what he says. "ewww. what smells like mustard?". I love that show. I can't wait until the new season starts. I wonder if we'll win the PROPNAME’s house that would solve all our problems for the rest of our lives. never having to do what we don't want to do. But it would be annoying to live in. I think you can tell a lot about a person by knowing  to what degree he or she likes the simpsons. Some idiots like my dad just think it's a cartoon, but it's really so much more. I should really finish that chapter that I didn't read. It was interesting enough, I just didn't have very much time to read. oh, I forgot some of my books, and I don't want to walk all the way to the dobie to get them. it's so hot! I'm so lazy. no wonder I’m a big fat cow, I can't even walk half a block to get my books. I should really start riding my bike again. I like the bus. it's so much easier and I don't have to carry my bike down those fucking stairs. I've climbed more stairs today than I have in a long time. I wonder if I’ll ever be able to go running without dying-- I think I’m just not built for it. PROPNAME is so athletic, and I’ll never be as fit as he is, and I’m really just slowing him down. Yay, it's 0:00, only 0 more minutes. I wonder if you freaks are actually going to read all 000 of these things. yeah, what is the point of this  stupid thing, anyway? I could see the point of that research project, but not this. You can't possibly read all these. M back hurts. I should probably try to have better posture. but I like to conserve energy. again, laziness. two more minutes. I’m tired, I think the sun drains all the energy out of me. I’m really sick of this stupid thing, and the minutes are going by so slow. it's really irritating me. I can' t wait to get to my email! I wonder how many messages I got in the last 0 weeks. well, it's now 0:00 bye. 
__label__label0 I have done this assignment three times in the past ten minutes and the computer has changed screens when I was looking t the keyboard, so I apologize if you have received several copies of this assignment already- in case you haven't I will write everything I have written already because it is what I am mostly thinking about - firstly though, my roommate is in the next TV room  and listening to the TV very loudly with apparently no regard for the fact that I am doing homework- the volume on the television is stopping me from having any complete thoughts which I suppose is ideal for your purposes but quite irritating to me- I have always disliked stream of consciousness writing especially since we read PROPNAME PROPNAME last year in my English class- We were given a similar assignment and I was told that I could not complete the assignment to my teacher's specifications, mostly because I think more clearly that I speak in most circumstances and even then I have to rework the thoughts over and over in my head before I feel they are strong to enter into an argument. I greatly enjoy debating, and I have never been accused of making a completely outlandish argument before( unless that was my goal in the first place, which falls under a different train of though so I won’t mention that here) but my brother and father would argue constantly as I was growing up and the insults and reasons behind those insults that be passed back and forth would be unorthodox and so deprived of reason that I made it my goal not to speak, especially in a debate, unless I was sure that my argument could not be beaten by any irrational statement-I mean rational statement I would let the irrational statements defeat themselves-  My favorite aspect of debate would actually be --this all gets back to a time when we were assigned to write a bill that we would take to a fake model united nations conference and we would have to present a bill that we wanted passed- in fact, my partner and I rarely wanted the bills we proposed to be passed, but we just wanted people to have to argue against them, in most cases we would try to make our bills interesting or at least darkly satirical, so that the only arguments that could be made against them would be based on moral rationalization rather than common reason- the moral debates would most likely get everyone interested and could be defeated by one who was willing not to be moral- none of our bills ever passed-As I write this I find that I am often losing my train of thought but I don't believe that that is how I usually think- as a result of the confines of this experiment I am discovering that I am thinking more quickly than I normally do and I can't explain why that is other to keep typing, however, when I am normally thinking, I still try to think slowly and articulately so as not to speak something that makes me look ignorant-this is said mostly to point to out possible flaws in the ways of tracing thoughts . now in fact I a running out of things to say-before I finish, which is still about seven minutes away- I'd like to apologize for the many spelling errors that are sure to be found in his assignment-  don't mean the errors that are natural such as words that I just don't know the spelling of but rather, I mean the words that look as if they have been written by an idiot because I am not a very talented typist and my fingers are slipping over the keys, I would go back and fix these errors but that seems contradictory to the nature of the assignment  0:00 that was the time at which I am writing this I am also realizing that occasionally there is no clear and concise thought n my head which I can write down or there are just so many thoughts that I an not possibly transfer them onto paper at the rate at which they are passing through- I hate leaving the impression with anyone that I am ignorant and I think that is the main reason I dislike this assignment, because I don't see how anyone can read this and not see exactly that- it is my hope that at least everyone will appear ignorant and then at least I will be on even ground - I also hate writing this to a professor of psychology because I am sure it is analyzed more than is necessary- if this assignment is done honestly then you could probably jut talk to someone and get just as many honest answers- well -I've just hit nineteen minutes and I suppose that last sentence is just a good a place to finish off as any where. 
__label__label1   Ouch, that hurts. Damn, damn, damn. I really don't care much for playing PROPNAME PROPNAME as a homework assignment. My understanding is that I get to talk about anything I feel like. Well, today I feel like talking about the absence of love. I've never, and I never will. I know this because I know myself; I've been acquainted with myself for the past 00 years. But, you know what?  Love doesn't come easily to someone who's never been given the chance to cry over another. And disappointment rides high among those who look toward the intangible as an archetype. And perhaps, love may not be recognized by one who stages the downfalls and disappointments by crowning the archetype. And what becomes of these kings?  They assure an even greater upset. My hell!  Who knew they'd turn out to be. human-of all things?  They've been raised by nourishing mothers who want to keep the cycle from breaking down. It's a revenge thing. What's revenge if our elders can't play?  And don't think the players of the game don't know. They all do. In fact, they're the unpolished beads hung through a thin thread patiently awaiting the cut that shatters all they hold. The dirty bastards don't mean it on the surface, but somewhere inside, not too deep, they feed off of this perverse pleasure. These prowling demons inside sense it. They know it and follow it by every word that falls from your mouth. They know it by every action pouring out of your senseless heart. But, wait, hold on. There is a simple solution to this problem. Find that beating cacophony that wakes you in the midst of terror, and do the smart thing all women should have accomplished by the age of 00. Rip it out, spit on it, and flush it down that damn toilet. Praise God for victory!  No more heartbreaks, no more suicidal tendencies (so I've heard), no more anything. Anything. Anything. I guess, I wouldn't know. Coming from one who's never been within a foot of love, it may seem an improper thing to do. But for those who have ridden on this vanishing wave, I'm sure the former action seems more than appropriate. However, and oh, I apologize so profusely for changing the tone so quickly-it loses audience, but I do have other things to do. um, however, if this route of throwing the heart is chosen, don't forget to wave goodbye to the emotions which allow one to cry, laugh, or even, yes, of all things-the sole feeling which gives you a natural high for days, the sole feeling that allows you to run around the world three times blindfolded on one leg without any replenishing substances-the feeling of love. Go ahead. Hypocrite would be a swell characteristic for this girl. But, must I ask, what is it that consumes two people who are in love?  The look in their eyes, the energy radiating through their bodies?  What is it that makes them. beautiful?  All of the time. I've never felt a consistent beautiful for longer than two days. consecutively. My dear, patient friend, that's exactly how I know it must be this emotion that I've never felt. It must be love. That emotion not specifically defined by anyone. 
__label__label0 OK. I don't know much about this computer stuff. I was lucky  to even get on to this homepage. Well I just got disconnected and I think my tension level just went up a few notches. I am felling really sick  already and I went this day to end. I was planning to go work out tonight but it is too late. I still have math and history work left to do. I  really hate math, I can't understand anything that is being said. It really makes me feel like an idiot. I look at my friends here and they all understand everything that is being said . I wish my math class in high school had taught me more. I guess tomorrow I will get up to go run. Ok. I just hit another wrong button , now I really feel worthless. I am going to have so much trouble this semester, when am I going to get to the classes that I really want. It is looking like I'm going to graduate college in another twenty years. As long as I do my best then I guess everything will work out. I miss my family and my friends back in LOCNAME. I wish that I could go back sometimes. If there was anything to go back to. I don't think that they really care that I am so far away. It is like I think to myself that things might be so much better there. Like if I  went back then my life would all make since. I think that I would be confused anywhere I go. Well my typing is starting to slow down now. My hands are getting tired. God, I should have taking a typing class in High school. My sweet mate is  watching late night and it is starting to get on my nerves. It is so loud. please let my twenty minutes be up. I need to get my act together if I don't then I will just be wasting my parents money. Maybe I should give my parents a call. But I think that I will wait for them to call me. I need to prepare for school. I need to try to socialize more. If I could manage more time. Maybe I should be an actor and work as a waiter in LOCNAME LOCNAME in the mean time. But there I go again with my fantasies. I'm probably stuck with a boring life like most people. Well my twenty minutes is up, I hope that my slow typing  has ruined this survey.  
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems like a long time. It amazes me how weird time is. Like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. I spend alot of time on planes. My dad is a pilot. I fly free. I don't know what I will do after college, because then I don't fly free anymore. I won't be able to go anywhere whenever. My roommate is in the shower. She has a sorority thing tonight. I'm not in a sorority. I'm glad, it's not the place for me. A guy died in my hometown last weekend. I t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and PROPNAME PROPNAME and Princess PROPNAME had just died. I didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. I think about that a lot. Death. Like what if someone died that I knew, but I had never told them what they mean to me. That's selfish, I know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. We as in humans. A friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. I like country music, but most people don't. I just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. My back hurts. I like to rub people's backs. I wish someone was here to rub mine. Tonight I'll be alone in the dorm. I like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. My roommate and I knew each other in high school. We have gotten along amazingly well so far. Knock on wood. I have never been in a car accident, when I was driving. My brother messed up his knee in a car accident. I like this song. He had to have his ACL ligament redone. He can be such a baby. I think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. I really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. That's just a personal opinion. I give lots of personal opinions. People tell me I'm opinionated. I don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. It's important to be able to communicate. I'm a speech major. My undergrad advisor is great. I met him at orientation, and I love him. He tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. I don't like this song. It's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. I wonder if I'll get married. I think I want to, but not kids. I do not want kids. That's another one of my opinions. How can we bring a child into this world?  So then people ask me if  I wish I hadn't been born. Two completely different concepts. Anyway, I'm gonna call my Aunt PROPNAME. She is like a second mother to me. I live my mother. She really is my lifeline. That's a scary thought, like could I survive without her?  Of course, she raised my to be a survivor. I love basketball. My mom and I watch games together all the time. The ORGNAME are my favorite team. I also like PROPNAME PROPNAME. But I hat e the bulls. PROPNAME always says what he is thinking. Some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but I love it. H breaks the mold. That's commendable in my book. I miss my cousins. One of them is a big basketball fan. He and I always talk basketball. I'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as I thought it would. I really like this song. I'm finished!! 
__label__label0 Well I'm finally doing this writing assignment. It was not in my mind at all so I totally forgot about this stuff. This assignment is taking me back to the seventh grade because in my English class. damn I keep messing up on my typing. well back to what I was talkin about. We had to write at the beginning of every class for five or ten minutes about anything that came to our mind; of course if we didn’t wanna write a story or something. So what I would write a lot is something like "I think this writing assignment sucks, . its stupid. and I’m bored. I'm bored. ", on and on and on. I also just would like keeping writing the alphabet in random order. Well now I'm listening to this tired ass song from Puff Daddy, "Ill Be Missin You"  It talks about death of a friend. To me that is very scary. Cuz I always imagine how it would feel when you die or like where do you go. Its just a scary feelin that you don’t know when we might not be here anymore. I had a few people that I knew die. Its just a sad thought. Now I’m thinking about how college isn’t that bad. Only if it wasn’t for me being lost in Calculus. I mean I shouldn’t have any trouble; I was Valedictorian and I feel very stupid, upset, frustrated, and scared. Oh shit. I just flinched cuz I got startled by the fact that some guy across the hall here just slammed the door very, very hard. Two times and said "jack ass" so loud that I heard him while I’m sittin here typing in my dorm room. Well I need to start getting on the ball and do all my reading and homework, especially in Calculus. For some odd reason its just not clicking for me. and math is supposedly one of my best subjects. I guess that was in high school. and I even took calc. last year. Oh, now the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME song is playing. I think that that movie wasn't as good as it was in the previews. So now I don’t really have anything else to talk about. Actually I cant wait to talk about my college experience cuz boy do I have some problems right now. Oh damn there's a phone call and I got up to get it but I don’t know what happened. Well I’m going to be going home tomorrow so I’m not going to the UT vs. ORGNAME on Sat. I think I’m gonna go to the library in a few minutes after I finish writing on here. I’m actually finished so I guess I’m Out. PEACE. 
__label__label0 I cannot believe that I am actually writing and doing my assignment on a Saturday. I am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying ORGNAME talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and I got nowhere with my friend. I feel so bad for my friend, PROPNAME. He is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. I feel like I should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. I guess that I should talk about myself and not about other people, but I am just so worried about him. I have been so extremely busy today. I woke up at 0 this morning. And I had to go to a BASIC meeting, which I am very involved in. I just happened to be 0 minutes late, and now I have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next Friday. I guess I don't mind if I do it to learn not to be late anymore. Then I had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. I didn't want to go, but I felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. I am glad that I went because they are my family and they helped to support me when I needed them most. Actually, my friend PROPNAME, which I just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when I asked him to help me move b/c he had a truck. I asked way in advance, and I called him the night before, and I even told him that he could back  out and I wouldn't even mind. He actually said to my face I don't want to do it when I had driven all the way from ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I couldn't believe that he had said that! I was so mad! I mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. Then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. I got prideful, and I said that I would take care of it myself. Then I realized my pridefulness, and I prayed to God to break me down. He definitely showed me how I need to be more patient these days. I then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. Our mutual friend had before, but PROPNAME somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. I don't know. I then thought about and then prayed some more, and then I realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. I went to LOCNAME on vacation, and I had bought him a key chain b/c I knew how stressed he was. I put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. The fact was that if I wasn't living by myself, then I could have gotten more help. And if he said that he was too busy, I would have understood, but he  said that he could. Everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. But he is so depressed and distraught and etc. I wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. I know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. I just don't understand why he is acting this way. I also have a feeling that he likes this girl  who was an old roommate. Everyone knows. For some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. I hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. She doesn’t happen to know, and I don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. I just hope that everyone gets better. 
__label__label0 Well this really pisses me off. I write you assignment to send to you but I get no connection. So I save it and try to do send it again. It got lost, even worse I have to do this again just turn this stupid thing in. For something I have already did, this really pissed me off. So to make sure you get this thing I'm thinking about emailing this to you. And to think I actually did truly analyze myself for this project, tell you my true feelings and you don't even get to see it. This is what is really going in my sub- consciousness. You well probably are not going to get a  memo like this class. Too bad, I really had a great paper or memo you could have really thought about. It was about time, and since I have to do this the Second TIME, it's  even hardier to write about. Speaking of time I have about 0 minutes left so here it goes. I feel that time is one  of the most under-rated things in this world today. Just  look at me I'm writing this memo for the second time today and have to do the other one tomorrow. Now that was a lot of stress for just one day. Still I accomplish more things under pressure, I think that is what I'm best at. Well it  is time for me to depart, so I hope I well learned something in your class. Man, this really is stress releasing. 
__label__label1 First I am wondering why I am doing this assignment - this seems silly but still my mind is always wandering and therefore this should not be difficult. I hope PROPNAME calls me back this evening. I really think I should be a happy guy as long as she stops talking about her dog. She is silly with her blonde hair I am hungry Jester food is so amusing I wonder if I can eat that food everyday after I graduate the girl sitting next to me is very "not amusing" I hope she does not stand up, for she probably wouldn't appreciate what I say about her I wonder if anyone else stares at people they find unattractive she probably thinks I want to take her on a date or something because I keep looking at her, but in reality the only place I would take her is to the zoo and tell her to stay there I don't enjoy typing but I suppose it keeps my fingers from getting fat when I took keyboarding in tenth grade I learned to type fairly fast but the only thing I remember typing in that class was the sentence Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. who said that PROPNAME Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country how exciting I would like to think that includes women as well because they can die too oh no the ugly girl just caught me looking at her I acted like I had a bug in my eye she is talking with the girl next to her, and surprisingly enough she is typing the same silly assignment I am  I really hope she is in the same lecture class as I am because I would like to sit next to her and ask her why her hair smells so bad is it a lack of shampoo or is it a hereditary flaw  either way I remember whey I watched Back to the Future part III when they were in the 0000's I bet everyone smelled back then  PROPNAME PROPNAME has been in alot of western movies I really do not like this computer because the more I write the more the screen moves over as if the line is a mile long  I have written for seven minutes already and I have only written seven lines  one line a minute is about as fast as I eat a taco but taco bell has this new hot sauce that they call FIRE how scary I can drink that stuff it is so hot I threw some on our fire in our chimney at home and it put the fire out  the girl working at the counter in the computer lab is not amusing either  Those glasses she is wearing went out of style when PROPNAME PROPNAME graduated highschool  if she has binoculars she can probably see my screen from her seat so if she kicks me out before twenty minutes I wonder if Mr. PROPNAME would be sympathetic  why are there pictures of whales on the wall maybe to remind most of the girls in here they ought not to eat too much I had a girlfriend named PROPNAME PROPNAME in seventh grade and we called her whale  but I didn't care because she was so nice  That is good  All guys should only care about personality to an extent, anyway  that's why I like PROPNAME. maybe two or three girls have come through my life that I could honestly say I didn't care what anyone else thought about them because I like them anyway. the last to own that title got pregnant last month so I was kind of angry with her. Most girls would probably break up with their boyfriends when they only offer to pay for 0/0 the cost of an abortion and they spend that money on marijuana  I was happy to lend her the money maybe she'll realize she's better off with me anyway because I would have paid for the entire thing and I would have gone through the procedure I God allowed me too  how long has it been now ok five more minutes   what would you like to know?   SUBMIT YOUR PAPER  that sounds silly I would rather crumple it up and throw it at my teacher   Teachers should tell the class more about themselves so may be I would now rather or not it was acceptable behavior to throw my exams at them. Do they like baseball?  I went to look up my friends number at the university of LOCNAME And m but he was not listed. The computer seemed to think he was the head of the alumni or something. Doubt it - he probably won't graduate because he smells too  he and PROPNAME ought to share a bathroom. he used to have a shaved head and a little horn on top. Which reminds me of the dumbest thing he's ever done when he worked at a video store and stole 00 porno movies. His parents are head of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME or something and they were kinda mad. he has no scruples he had to pay 000 dollars for those movies and he wanted to watch them at my house. Doubt it I don't steal from video stores and I will not agree to his stealing them either, but I did watch this movies at his house. they were exciting I guess one of the girls names was heather Hooters she was pretty but I doubt she was 000% natural is anyone I know going to read this?  That's ok cause I am happy with who I am   I will tell the whole world I love, well something, I won't mention because if the president of this university knows he will transfer me to a and m. ok I love farming. The sound of the plow chu chu chu through the grass is almost enough to bring me to orgasm. one more minute can you tell I 'm looking at my watch I shouldn't treat this as a paper where I am talking to someone else but rather just with myself but how can I think about anything else when my fingers hurt so much from typing maybe PROPNAME will call but I hope I can hold off on calling her - time to eat - Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.       Oops I almost hit the clear button. 
__label__label0 TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn’t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my ORGNAME class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 0 classes to attend. English at 0 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 0:00 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 0:00 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 0tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won’t probably ever be true until I'm about 00 and he's 00. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away ORGNAME by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My ORGNAME teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since ORGNAME's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 0 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   
__label__label1 stream of consciousness - well, The first thing that comes to mind is why exactly do I have to do this? I know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. I am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. I want to become a doctor but then again I want to be a musician too. I mean I have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. I want to continue but a part of me is saying - You need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! I want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. I don't know what to write about anymore! I'm laughing at myself because whatever I am typing I am literally reading it out loud to myself as I write it. I'm thinking is that normal? Anyway, I'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and I am amazed as just how fast I type without formal or informal training. I then think about how blessed I am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once I figure out which dream is possible or realistic. How do I know that my major is the right one? I mean, I am now a microbiology/pre-med ,major and I don't know if that's my fate. Should I be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. I am looking at how long I have been typing. Only 00 minutes. The phone just rang and I had to answer it; I hate that happened because I was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if I would write continuously. What am I talking about? Well, anyway, I enjoy music and stage. I like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. My contacts are bothering me; somehow I have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, I was just disturbed for about 00 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his Ethernet card. But guess what I am almost done . I just have a few more minutes. I don't what to write about. I hope that this class is going to be very beneficial. I hope to learn alot because psychology, esp. the physiological aspects really interest me. I'm wondering whether or not I will get an "A" this semester for PSY 000. Well, I'm done! 
__label__label1 that's no good. I was informed as I entered the room that my friend tom's  girlfriend broke up with him. they were engaged;  I hope he comes  through this ok. he gets depressed sometimes,  and uses poor judgement. wow . . . it just occurred to me the more complex problems I face as I age. there's a  volleyball game going on outside in the jester courtyard (I assume . . . tom's roommate insists that it's a drunken festival of debauchery - I can't see out the window). I find their play loud and distracting, but the courts are there for that  purpose and I have no right to complain. the stereo turned off and I find the only noise in the room to be that of my typing. I like music as I work. it  helps me to concentrate. I find that I’m considerably addicted to sound. when I was younger (and not paying an electric bill) I even needed music to sleep. I listened to my  Beatles record whi0le I cooked dinner tonight. chicken fried steak,  mashed potatoes and abbey road  -  fantastic combination. I found that there's a slight scratch  on "Mr. mustard"  -  those bastards at the record shop are supposed to be honest about the condition of the albums . . . it would be easier had they allowed me to  listen to it before I bought it. what kind of record shop has no turntable?  still, I’m glad to have it - I collect old vinyl from some of my favorite groups . . . certain bands have a different sound and feel on record. I started collecting  when my brother bought me "working man's dead. "  he originally inspired my interest in the grateful dead,  I guess that fits. I have discovered in the past few years  just how, in my younger days, I religiously aspired to be like my brother. he's a great guy . . . I’m glad that he's succeeding in life - we went through some troubling stages together. I miss him when I’m at school. it's been five years since we lived in the same house,  but at school I’m 000 miles away rather than across town. tom's talking on the phone to one of our friends,  PROPNAME,  who goes to school  at LOCNAME. computers are amazing things - my phone bill would be outrageous if I couldn't e-mail my friends who attend school in other states. he's talking about the "break-up" now. this whole situation sucks. 
__label__label0 Well I'm not sure what to start talking about. It's taken forever just to get this assignment started. I had to set up an if account and all that before I could  start. I hate coming to new computer labs, this one is new to me because I just transferred here. I feel totally computer illiterate, so I start to feel like an idiot when the lab people have to go around with me and me  figure it all out. But anyway, I'm here now doing it, and I guess you always learn something from these situations. I learned that I need to get my own account set up from my computer in my room, so then I don't have to worry about coming up here and dealing with this. I guess we are just supposed to tell you what we're thinking about and our thoughts as they change. Well all I keep thinking is I wonder what you are going to think about my thoughts and ramblings when you read this. Maybe you'll enjoy it because I sound paranoid and you can analyze me! ha ha I'm looking out the window now at the trees, wishing I was out there and not working on this assignment. I still have fifteen more minutes to write. I wonder what everyone else here is working on. I'd rather be here doing this than doing the physics equations I was working on before I got here. Psychology is so much more interesting than the other sciences. Well now I have an E-mail account. I never had one before. I think it will be fun to be able to send and get mail. Especially because my boyfriend still lives in LOCNAME and its getting expensive calling each other every day, but it wouldn't be the same not to here his voice. I've never really been in the ORGNAME before, I registered here but I haven't ever been in here to do any work. I probably should have been in here before now though! I think the chairs are to too low or maybe the desks are too high, its just not that comfortable. I guess they want you to sit up and have good posture like they taught you in typing class. There, I lost my cursor for a while. I guess that’s why it says - Who knows I. Well I have to help cook dinner at my co-op tonight, we are having LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wonder what that’s going to taste like, good I hope. Well my time is just about up  so I guess its time to submit my paper. I hope you never read these but even if you do I guess I won't really matter because with the size of our class you don't know me from PROPNAME!  
__label__label0 PROPNAME PROPNAME. Here I am in the computer lab in my dorm. I really do not know what to say because I have never had an assignment like this before. Anyway, college life is very different from my high school life. I do no t drink therefore being with a complete different crowd of people, I find myself being very uncomfortable. I suppose once I get settled and used to my new surroundings that everything will be fine. Don't get me wrong, I love ORGNAME. I could not wait to get here, it is just the whole different atmosphere. I have met a lot of interesting people so far and I am sure there are many left to find and meet. My classes are so much more time consuming than I ever expected. I joined a sorority this year and now I never seem to have any time to myself. Then there is the whole boyfriend situation. My boyfriend goes to ORGNAME. Real convenient right. I miss him so much when I am here. He is the best person I have ever met in my entire life. His generosity, compassion, sensitivity, and love amaze me. I am so happy when I am with him. He is coming tomorrow to see me. Needless to say I am counting down the hours and minutes until he arrives. I have so much planned for us to do. I am fine being with out him. Long distance relationships are harder than you think they would be. We are making it work however. I have never trusted anyone as much I do him. I think it is the same with him. I am not nervous about him being in a different town or setting - I know he would never do anything to hurt. It is just the whole being apart thing. it has only been two weeks since we have seen each other. Sounds like a short time to everyone else but they just do not understand. that is another thing. I do not think many people understand me. My boyfriend, PROPNAME does- very well- it is almost scary well he knows and understands me. it also provides comfort though. I cannot believe this whole paper has turned into a description of my life with my boyfriend. Anyway, he is coming tomorrow like I said and I cannot wait. Next weekend I am going home to LOCNAME. PROPNAME is going with me. I was on drill team and will be returning to the homecoming game. It will be a nice break from the hectic college world. I miss my bed. there is something about YOUR bed. the ones here are not the same. I miss my dog too. She is so sweet and loving. She used to sleep with me and now there is not a lump in the foot of my bed. Well I believe my time is up. this was fun. I have never sat down and written out my thoughts and feelings - I think it helps!       
__label__label1 it has been raining for the past 0 days and I guess that has  a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. I feel a little relieved and tired though I had my first test of the semester this morning. I feel tired because I spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like I should have. now I was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. I should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. I called my father today. I'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason I seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that I know that I am doing wrong but I still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. I guess he think is that if I am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. I'm trying to get it to him that I still have a lot of things going for me. I guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. I feel totally different though. I believe that I have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well I will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise            
__label__label0 I am completely computer illiterate and I never trust them. I have a lot of reading to catch up on and I am worried that I will not have enough time this week. A bunch of my friends and I are flying to LOCNAME LOCNAME on Friday morning for the ORGNAME vs. UT football game. We are only staying until Sunday evening but that takes away an entire weekend. I should probably bring some of my books with me on the airplane because I think it's about a four hour flight. I am also mad at myself because I took a really long nap today which wasted a lot of time. I think I really needed to catch up on my sleep though from this weekend. We stayed up really late after the game on Saturday and then I woke up early on Sunday to drive to LOCNAME. I went in town to visit my family because I missed them and hadn't been home in a while. We went out to dinner on Sunday evening and then went to look at my Dad's new office. He just moved, it's a little bit smaller than his old one but he doesn't have a partner any more so he doesn't need as much space. Well, now I'm off to try to get on to the Pretesting page.   
__label__label1 I wonder if I am doing this right. I can't stop thinking about truyen. I need to stop. PROPNAME, she is like two hundred miles away and I can't get her out of my mind. I need money. I need something. maybe a drink. maybe I need a cigarette. I was trying to quit but I just can't seem to do it. its only been two minutes now and I have already run the course of my brain. I need to do my laundry. I want to swear, but I might offend whom ever is reading this . if anyone is reading this , what should I do???????? I 'm hungry. shoot I stopped. Oh well, I can get back into it. I really don't think I am doing this right. I wonder if heather will feed me? I really want a drink. I am stressed out and I just need to party. I'm not an alcoholic. I think my hypothalamus is screwed up. shit my bag is in my way, It's on fire AAAHHHHHHH I can't breathe. I keep pushing that damn backspace button. I am just not going to push it anymore no matter what mistakes I make. I wrote that entire sentence without a mistake. ironic huh. shit! I pushed it again. What in god's name am I doing here? I 'm talking about a backspace button and what 's really on my mind is the fact that I have no money and I am lonely. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this, but oh well. I don't care who reads this. You only know that I am a number. Maybe if you got to know me I would scare the living shit out of you. I am screwed in the brain. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA I have like fifteen more minutes and my arms are getting sore. I need to stop, but I can't' stop! I need to press on with my story of nonsensical blabbering. I want to go home. I need a job. I need a woman. I have a woman but she is in LOCNAME and I am in LOCNAME. Am I forcing myself to think this? Am I just doing this for the show. No I really am hungry. Who am I talking to anyway. That guy next to me thinks I am weird. WEIRD I can tell he thinks that I am just typing away on this little machine and not really saying anything. But am I? TEST I like to push the buttons, PROPNAME. I push them all at once and lock up the computer calm down now. I can't just blab on this thing all day l0ong. I need o go home. I need to go back to LOCNAME. I need a hamburger. I need a drink I need a  A in this class. I need a smoke. Me memmemememem why is it always about my needs what do you want? what do you need? these chairs are comfy. my I have a dirty shirt long arms weird hands. Am I just writing these things,. hoping that someone will read it and tell my what is wrong? Am I looking to be labeled? Am I crazy? Am I stupid? I'm not stupid. I know what's going on. I can see you guys are trying to make me paranoid, well it ain't going to work. Nobody makes me paranoid. That's my little joke, get it? I'm paranoid about being paranoid. It's funny. Laugh you friggin computer ! Is my time almost up yet In this land you can't stop until you have been programmed. Am I programmed yet? what the hell am I doing? I want to go get something to eat. I can't I have no $$$ I have a job interview tomorrow. I hope I get the job so that I can eat and buy gas to go home and tell PROPNAME how I feel about her. FUCK you your never going to tell her that. Someday I will. yeah right. No If I just go to her and say, hey I really like you and I want to marry you, she will run screaming and never want to see me again. I can't do that. But I can't just sit in my biology class with all these beautiful women and think about her all my life. I need to do something. The time has expired. 
__label__label0 I keep coughing so much in class I think I probably annoy the crap out o everybody there. I should stop smoking so much. It feels good to be back in school, seeing friends again, but I miss my mom. She is wittiog all the way in LOCNAME and I'm over here. IT sucks. But there is always Christmas time, so it is not that bad. I have no idea what that holiday is going to be like. This guy just bumped in to me an did not even apologize. I hate it when people do that. He just walks by like It's okay to knock people into a damn computer screen. Jerk. I don't understand how I am going to keep writing for twenty minutes. The way I type it will probably be the worst thing anyone has ever read. I tend to type fast and then screw up a lot along the way. There is a guy near me talking a bout the Swiss air crash and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I hate baseball so I couldn't care less. There goes my cough again. I got to get home soon, I got a date. This is really a nice girl and I hope it works out, but I will probably spend the hold time coughing anyway. The guy is now talking about wire services. What in the world are wire services. I am getting kind of thirsty and I should get a drink of water, but I do not know where the water fountains in this library are. I hate asking people about it, I guess I feel stupid. I wonder what the guys who read this stuff do. Do they analyze it of just laugh at the kind of things people come up with. I would probably laugh a lot. If this was me reading it I would be cracking up. Then a gain I am kind of a jerk. What I don't understated about the internet is how people think its so much phone. I like e mail and research its great. But this whole surfing the web for hours like its some sort of athletic event seems kinds stupid. I thinks I sound like some commercial  I saw. Its amazing how TV effects you like that. You watch some stupid ditcom and then start using the vocab all over the palace. IT hate the people who keep going yadda yadda because of Seinfeld. But then again I pick up enough catch [phrases anyway. I just looked at  the watch, another ten minutes of writing. This is really weird. This is the first psych class I have taken and so far I enjoyed it. This is a different kind of activity. I have difficulty understanding how this helps us learn anything, but then again I am cynical by nature. The prof was talking about the brain today and it was really technical  I thought the class would not be like that. Not that I mind or I did not understand it, it was just a surprise. Somebody once told that psych classes are some of the most fun, I hope he is right. I don't see much of him anymore, he got married and has kids. So his life really changes. He's like my brother, wee used to hang out and drink beer all the time and go to games and stuff like that. Now he only wants to take his baby to the Children's museum and  do family things. I love the kid, but I miss the old him who would drive off to new Orleans on a whim because he wanted a sandwich form a particular cafe. It's funny who people change. I' feel I have changed in college. I would not say I grew up, I just found out things about myself that I would not have ordinarily known like what it's like to be away form all the comforts of home and how I would handle it. Or to be away form LOCNAME and in LOCNAME again. I kind of glorified it but it did not turn out that way. I hope that December comes so, I am looking forward to all my friends and my parent, an my dog . I want to get a dog hear but the apt does not allow it so I guess I am stuck. My place is too small anyway. I have not really seen that  many apt in Austin that allow pets. but I am sure there a lot. Hey that girl is really cute.                                               
__label__label1 Realizing that I am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. Everyday, I open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and I have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. I have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now I posses all these things. And as excited as I am, I also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. Not in myself or my actions but in all I have left behind. Yes I am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but I am also talking about my childhood and innocence. Ok, go with me for a little bit--- I know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. I am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. I don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. My teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. All those thing that I took for granted but were a daily part of my life. Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom of college and the fact that I can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call  my mom if I happen to skip class. I really don't know where I'm going with this, all I can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. It's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. I am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so I don't oversleep. Yet, I should confess that so far, I am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. One thing I  certainly enjoy is the fact that I can spend more time with my friends and I can go out on weekdays and I can eat unhealthy food as much as I want. Not to say that I indulge myself in such activities constantly. I guess the point of it all, is that I am confused. I am trying to find out who I am. And I think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. Throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, I think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. Oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.  
__label__label1 I mean, really I do. Only draw back is it makes for fairly lousy formal papers. I really ought to put my desk together. Then I wouldn't have to type on the floor. Hey, a castle!  Groovy!  I'm not sure if this should be a dialogue with a nonexistant reader, but that's how I'm going to treat it. That's what my last regular stream of consciousness writing was. In 00th grade I took a theory of knowledge course for which we were supposed to keep a journal. At one point, I digressed on the memory of a goldfish which is about 0 seconds. Therefore, every time they swim around in their little bowls, they see a whole new world. Hence, Hey!  A castle! Groovey!  I've got to get my Relafin refilled. Them maybe I won't spend do much time fantasizing about setting my leg on fire. And we always thought my brother was the pyro . . I really want a new modem. Rephrase, I want a faster modem. I keep getting a java script alert when I try to do the pretesting, so I thought it might be my version of Netscape. So obviously, I decided to down load a newer version. That was about an hour and a half ago. I'm still downloading. ah, ethernet. Your sweet siren call beckons me away from independet living towards a dorm. Oh wait. I would NEVER get housing. No, I'm not bitter. No, LOCNAME didn't send back my housing application because I'd sent too much money. No I wasn't over 000 on the waiting list for housig. Grumble. Really, it doesn't bother me. Shoot. Another fifteen minutes. My brother's girlfriend is online. Back to my previous thought. I'm still not quite adjusted to being back in the LOCNAME. First, I lose all energy and appetite every time I go outside. I don't deal well tith humidity and heat to begin with, and moving from six weeks of 00-00 degree weather straight into LOCNAME in August, well, it's not pretty. Also, every once in a while I'm confused as to which side of the street the cars will be coming from. The one time I crossed the street right after I got back, I reached the middle of the road and was SO confused. Why does my neck hurt?!  For some reason, I don't feel a need to rip it off and set it on fire, but I'm definitly considering doind it to my hip. Hmm, someone else is online. I'm going to check. Nope, just the program making noise. I REALLY don't get along with this computer. I have a better relationship with my hip. Stupid computer. No,no, it's not the computer's fault. At least not entirely. I still haven't forgiven it for trying to tell me I had no modem. And preventing me from getting into Windows for a week. Oh. And fo not letting me run any ORGNAME program written after 0000. Ooh Baby. Seven miutes. Bloody "n" key keeps sticking. Ah well. I wish I didn't have to type this. Writting or typing cannot keep up with my jumble of thoughts. In the time it took to write that sentence I flashed to my philosophy study groupo, and this sentence saw the thought about the Romans in LOCNAME. "We don't like the river where it is. Okay, we'll just move it then. "  I wonder how upset they were to not be able to build PROPNAME's wall in a perfect straight line. Poor dears. I should not find the Romans amusing. Oh well. Hey!  A castle!  Groovey!  I'll type for another four minutes or so. My neck really hurts. I still don't want to set it on fire, though. Gee. all my sentences have "I" in them. We're certainly being egocentric this evening. Me, me, me. That was a joke. Poor and only for my benefit. All right. I'm finished with this exercise. Good night, so long, TTFN, and Cheers! 
__label__label1 Why do we even have computers if they are  so slow and crappy and can't hold more than "X" number of people at a time. time. And why can't I put Chip Smart out of business. They sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. We had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. I am pretty ticked off right at the moment. I don't feel like writing this assignment. I had to buy First Aid 00 to get the new modem to work. It just started working after a long and horrid battle so I am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. Why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. I don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. I hope you really aren't reading this, because I am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. I can think of nothing else but the immense dislike I have for my computer. I should name it Lucifer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I just got married Aug. 0. Therefore I am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at LOCNAME LOCNAME here in LOCNAME. I miss my father. His birthday was 0-0 and I forgot!!!!!!!  I felt like crying all day. I miss my mother too. Her birthday is coming up in February. (0-0-00)  I truly don't know my father's age. He is older than my mom I know. They divorced when I was 0. After that I guess I lost count. I was adopted  here in LOCNAME at LOCNAME. I was extremely lucky, because I got the best 0 parents in the whole world!  I truly mean that. I love them. I also miss my brother. He is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME right now doing much better. He wants to start working on his career now. He had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. He is 0 years younger than me and is learning disabled. He had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. This center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. Well, as you can probably tell I love my family. More importantly I love God because He sent His son PROPNAME to die for my sins and because I accept Him, believe in Him, and in return I have given Him my life to use me for His glory. Time is up. 
__label__label1 It started out kind of good because school hadn't started. All I had to worry about was relaxing, working out, and enjoying life. Now, another variable, school, has been injected into the equation. I realize that it is a necessary evil because without it, I can never advance in life. Hopefully, one day I can work only when I want to work. Until then I will try to make the best of my life and enjoy every day like it was my last. You know, I should start my mission statement right now. I have also been wanting to put together a compilation of my own philosophies so that I would have a road map to live my life. I wish it were that easy. Anyway, here I am revealing how my mind works. It is kind of like a release to me. I should do this more often.       Recently, I have been thinking a great deal about my own shortcomings. These include my limited ability to speak, my limited athletic ability, and my the fact that I am not as charming and smooth as I want to be. Part of me wants to admit these shortcomings and accept it. The other part of me says I should always keep a positive outlook and refuse to accept these traits. I am at a point in my life where I don't know if I can ever fully improve this. As much as I would like to, it seems that I have hit a plateau and maximized my potential. But I guess I have to keep hope.     Moving on to other subjects, I wonder if I will ever find a woman to spend  the rest of my life with. Relationships require so much work, more than I may be willing to put in. This bothers me because I don't want to be 00 years old and lonely. Sometimes I realize that having faults, emotions and feelings is part of the price I have to pay for being a human. 
__label__label1 right now I feel like I'm kind of pressured to do this thing right because it's my first assignment for the class and I don't want to mess up. I hate that feeling where you think your doing something right but when you turn in the assignment in to the teacher they say that you did the assignment wrong. especially when you ask the teacher how long an assignment/paper suppose to be and they say they don't care but when you turn it in they tell you it's too short . well anyway I guess I'm getting off topic . I tend to do that a lot sometimes . Right now I'm feeling a bit hungry cause I only ate a small bit of food for breakfast (at 0:00pm that is ). Yes I feel very well rested too cause I slept till noon. speaking of food it reminds of this lady who works in the cafeteria at the place I'm staying at. I don't like her very much because she said something about me in front of my face to another worker in Spanish. she assumed that I didn't understand what I said but let me tell you---I didn't take five years of Spanish and not learn to understand the language. also I didn't work with Hispanic people and not learn how to pick up a few words here and there. so what really pissed me off was not what she said (which really wasn't that offensive at all) but the fact that she would say it in a language she thought I wouldn't understand and more importantly she did it while I was still there. oh here I go about things in the past. I know I should just learn to let little things like that go but I can harbor a lot of my emotions for a long time, but they do eventually go away. besides I'm glad that I can know whether or not what I feel is justifiable. never mind forget what I just said it doesn't make any sense. it's hard to explain. you know I wish I could type as fast as I think cause by the time I finish this sentence I've already thought up of something else. I think my mind thinks too fast I feel old. I've noticed that recently I've begun forgetting a lot of stuff. not important stuff but miniscule little information that I would normally remember . usually I could remember a lot of pointless things but now it takes a little while for me to. wow I wish I could write papers like this because the time just flies by. you know what I don't think I stuck with the topic. I mean it is kind of vague . I mean chances are if someone is sitting in front of a computer and you ask them to write about their feelings at that instant they're probably going to be a little apathetic at that moment unless your referring to what they've been feeling like through the date because if that is the case I guess I can elaborate. so far I've been kind of tense , worried that this assignment might be too boring to take the time to write I mean it is twenty minutes but I guess twenty minutes is too much. Also I was worried that the computer lab might be too full but it wasn't and then I was worried that I might be able to connect to the site because I was afraid that the site might be down (I've heard horror stories about it). I guess I worry too much but I consider more of an asset to my life more than a hindrance because the fear makes think of all the things that can go wrong so I plan ahead of time and think of the alternatives. I wish I could say the same of my little sister but it seems like he never thinks ahead and about the consequences of her actions oh well times about up now my only fear is that the submit button will work properly. 
__label__label1 I just don't feel like I have quite gotten into the groove of school yet. I hate that we start before labor day, because I feel like I am just getting my schedule back to normal when I get another vacation. I think I'm going home to see my mom this weekend, my birthday is tomorrow and hers is on Monday so were going to have a girls weekend, shopping, makeovers, haircuts, I can't wait. I wish that PROPNAME was coming with me though, I hate to travel by myself, especially flying, I'm glad the flight only takes an hour but I really do not like to fly. I can't imagine going to LOCNAME and being on a plane for an entire day, I would want to jump out, it just makes me feel trapped at least when your in the car you can stop along the way for a travel break. anyway, besides getting ready for this weekend, I have a lot of homework I need to finish, so I can have fun while I'm home, my horoscope told me today was a good housecleaning day, I've been needing to do that ever since PROPNAME's party, so I better do it today, or ill have to wait till the next full moon, or favorable planetary alignment!:)  I don't really believe in horoscopes, but I still read them, especially around my birthday, silly superstition I guess, my horoscope for this week said I should do something memorable and kind of crazy for my birthday. I'm thinking that's not such a bad idea. I've only got a couple more years left that its still socially acceptable for me to be irresponsible. what crap, I hope I'm doing pseudo-irresponsible (not life-threatening and stupid, just fun)  until I'm very, very old. its so weird that I would want to be like that, because I don't think I give off that image to the world. actually taking risks really scare me and I avoid them in real life as much as possible, but my rich a varied fantasy life is full of them. this should give you a clue to how type a I am, my fantasies about taking risks usually just include planning them, hardly ever actually doing them. where was I? oh yeah birthday, so I'm kind of bummed out bc I gave PROPNAME a really great party and bought him lots of presents bc at the time we had money, but surprise his stupid company hasn't paid him yet so right now a great birthday present for me would be to pay the bills. I'm feeling a little guilty about the way I spent money on him, when I sort of knew what the situation would be, but I can't do anything about it now, and I feel like its selfish of me to want him to reciprocate what I did for him. I guess that's my spoiled only child coming out. I really did have fun watching him opening his presents and enjoying his party, I didn't do those thing so he would do the same for me, but I would be nice! okay back to school I'm feeling okay about most of my classes even chemistry, but I do not want to fail calculus again! that would suck, I already dislike the prof's teaching style. I know he wants us to learn by understand the proofs, he thinks that doing tons of problems for practice, which is what I like, is a "high school" way to learn,  he actually really gets on my nerves. I really don't care about understanding calculus, I don't even have to take the second part, I just want to memorize formulas and pass the tests, too bad it doesn't seen to work like that in his class. I guess if I just keep up with it should be okay, that was my problem last semester, I just kept getting further and further behind, and tried to cram the night before the final. that works in my liberal arts classes, but in none of my science classes, which I guess in a strange way is why I like them. when I enjoying what I'm learning I don't mind reading everyday, and usually by the end of the semester I can really apply what I've learned in broader terms. it was really cool to see that a lot of the methodology and general theories I learned in my ecology classes were also used in psy. calculus is not one of those things I feel like I'm going to enjoy 
__label__label1 this job is going to drain me if I don't say something to these people I think they're too spoiled 0 minute almost done okay want to go home oh but yeah I need to check pretesting this is the longest minute okay bye. 
__label__label0 I still do not understand why my father after twenty years of marriage to my mother decides out of the blue that he is not happy and to get a divorce. why he feels that he needs to be with that other slut. my mother has been a great wife to him and without her he would probably be nowhere today. he thinks that just because he will give her money that she will be okay without him. but money can't buy happiness. I just hope that my little brother is a okay he is only twelve years old and he gets sad when he thinks about his dad not being there I just do not know how I am going to be ready for my test on Wednesday I have to study way too much for the next two days and I need to get an a in biology I need to do good in all of my classes to raise my ORGNAME I just  hope that my mom does good on her test also because she has been working hard to make the grade my little brother has been working hard in football to get the starting position with his little friends I wish that could just go back to being a little kid when everything was okay with my parents and I did not have to worry about anything but just being a little kid I would not need to worry about anything hopefully he will come back to his senses and come back home 
__label__label1 Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 00000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in LOCNAME, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) 
__label__label1 So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking. Ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a "social smoker. "  I have told him how I feel and asked that he at least not smoke when I'm around because I refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. Besides, I don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. I care way too much about him. We've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. He's really important to me and I'd do anything for him. That's why I hate the fraternity so much. I see the bad influences they have on him. He wants to go to medical school, and he MUST have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. He certainly has the potential and I really don't want him to fail. But, I really need to learn to let others lead their lives. I know I can't boss everyone around. I know I'm very controlling and that I've really made some bad feelings between us, but I can't help it. I get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when I think about all that stuff. I hate it when people don't listen to me (usually I end up being right too). Well, that's 00 minutes.  
__label__label0 I've never liked writing and any other literature stuff like reading. I also feel a bit different because I've never done my homework on the webpage before. It's a new thing for me. Everything in college feels different. The schedule is flexible; you can have classes from 00 to 00 and then jump to 0 to 0, not all continuously throughout the day. There's also the good thing that I don't have to go to classes I don't want to go to. This freedom of choice gives me a feeling of relaxation but also fear. I feel great that I can do whatever I want, but feel fearful that my choices might not be the best for me. This assignment gives me a feeling of nervousness. I hate writing, especially when I have a time limit on it. It's hard enough for me to come up with stuff to write about when I have plenty of time, and it gets harder when I have a time limit, whether or not that there is no right or wrong things to say. I feel like I'm saying many wrong things because a lot of this is not so much feeling but some experiences I went through in college. I can't write about my feelings for 00 minutes because it's hard to know what I'm feeling and even harder to write about it. 
__label__label0 K. , now I'm writing, but I'm actually kind of confused about what to do. I never really had an assignment such as this one. I feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so I guess I feel some what good right now. I feel excited about school because I finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. I guess my hopes are kind of high right now. I was also excited about your class since I nearly did not get in. At first, the class was closed and so I gave up until I peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after I added your class. I also feel kind of stressed because I'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. On top of all of this I am now taking more hours this semester than I have ever had, so I guess I have my work cut out for me this year. I am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, I feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if I have now surpass the 00 minute mark or not. Nope, still got quite a bite of time left. So, lets see what else I feel. I also feel somewhat lonely because I had to leave my family and friends at home. Even though I have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. My goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 0. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. I like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. I found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. Confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. So, I hope that's ok. Part of the confusion I feel is because of this class. I went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now I had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if I'm allowed by the computer. Ah, my time is almost up and I'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. Alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone. 
__label__label1 I just waited 00 minutes for a bus to come and pick me up from the nursing building. in the dark and I got very agitated and edgy. Every car of course had their headlights on and a million cars must have passed by me. I'm still seeing spots even now. I'm upset because I think everyone has forgotten me since I moved off to college. I guess they do. I do feel like a number here at LOCNAME despite what they say about getting involved. Every night I come home excited to see if I got any e-mails, messages or mail- but I hardly ever do. They're ALWAYS for my roommate. I still expect to wake up in the morning and see my old room at home, but I get a nasty feeling in my stomach when everything comes into focus and I realize that I'm in some unusual place. and then I realize its my dorm room. Everyone told me the first week would be toughest and that everything is downhill on an easy ride from there. But it isn't working that way for me. Everything is going WAY uphill and the climb is getting even harder than my first week. I want to go home next week and see my family and my dogs, but I know if I do I won't want to come back and it will be even worse than my first day here because I know how awful it can be now and I  will dread that returning again. I'll wait until I get on my feet to go back. Does this page keep moving down?  The phone just rang again and of course it was for my roommate. She has to call her mom when she gets back. Then she'll hog the phone until 00:00 tonight talking to everybody in the world and their dog. And when my mom calls for ME I'll have to call her back because my  roommate will be on the phone and by the time she's off, my mom will be in bed and it would be futile to try and call her back so late. I'm a very SLOW typer. I hope nobody is really reding this because they would think I was an absolute ogre. I'm really not. I put on a good front for other people. Everyone thinks I'm anorexic because they say "I'm a toothpick". If only they saw how much I eat. I hate being so skinny and being able to do nothing about it. Everyone wants to be skinny right?  But not to an extreme, right? I have loads of trouble finding clothes, I have to stuff myself till I practically pop at every meal so I don't lose any more weight. I'm sick all of the time, I can't excercise a lot or else I shed pounds and spend too much of my needed energy, my poor parents have to pay a fortune for heart surgery for me because my low weight has caused serious side effects. I've never been anorexic, bolemic or anything for that matter yet people automatically assume that I am. I noticed in that pre-testing, that a lot was aimed toward eating disorders. Yet everyone fails to notice that there are some of us out here who need help with feeling too skinny. How come larger people and insecure people always  get the help, when there's others out here who need some too. WE get tired of doctors shooing us away and finally don't do anything about it until the damage is already done, and it's not like we caused it to be that way like others. I miss my friends. I miss my family, and I'm signing off now because I'm getting really irritated.      
__label__label0 I could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - PROPNAME's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. I could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. What used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. People are running around with bad attitudes because they are the "rebellious" ones. It is truly not they that are rebellious. They are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. True rebellion is seen in writing. In the early years of the LOCNAME LOCNAME, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. I think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. I think it was PROPNAME who was greatly criticized for his Scarlet Letter. He wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished?  She had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but I think that ORGNAME only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. The story was truly about the liberation PROPNAME PROPNAME found in her life. I don't think that is exactly what I was aiming at, but I am sure someone would understand. I like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when I compare myself to others of greater intelligence I find myself utterly an idiot. While on the subject of intelligence I would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. I do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. I feel as though there is something of importance that I could say, however seeing as I am the utter idiot, I find a rare occasion that I have anything interesting to say. I guess I would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. I would like to soak up a lot of life while I have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. I mean, sometimes I am trying so hard to enjoy life I forget that I am living it. There will never be another today. This is the only August 00, 0000 that I will ever experience. I would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent. 
__label__label1 But I can't go to sleep because I have mounds of homework to do. The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend PROPNAME and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend PROPNAME would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in LOCNAME, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. PROPNAME is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 0 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to PROPNAME. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 00 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 00 minutes are up now. SO long. 
__label__label0 I haven't been in the mood to do any homework. I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from LOCNAME LOCNAME. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends ORGNAME. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in LOCNAME. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to LOCNAME because I didn't want to go to ORGNAME because my brother went there. UT and ORGNAME were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, PROPNAME, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. PROPNAME goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. PROPNAME is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and PROPNAME. PROPNAME I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and PROPNAME are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes PROPNAME's side. My reasoning was because I thought PROPNAME was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say. Don't think I'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but I just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. Which leaves me very lonely. It's mainly my fault because I don't want to spend much time with PROPNAME because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. PROPNAME, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except I don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) PROPNAME, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. And PROPNAME, who called me yesterday just to talk. Now how nice is that?  I mean, I went to PROPNAME's today before class, and I had fun. She's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. )  Which I guess why I used to have bad feelings towards her. She's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but I kind of want to meet my own friends. I group of new friends. Also, PROPNAME the homesick one made friends too. Which is good, because she needs to be happy. However, I think it is about time for me to make some friends. Well, also I tried out for the ballet class here. It sucks!  I'm so mad. There are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. I was stuck in the freshmen class. It is so bad. I've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. Not to mention there is no pointe here!  I am not trying to sound smug, because I was far from being the best at my studio at home. But these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. Don't get me wrong, I was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to "place our arm on the barre"  I almost died. I know where to put it. I don't need help with that. I need help with my turnout, extension, balance!  NOT WITH WERE TO PUT MY ARM ON THE BARRE!  Well, as you can see I am not excactly a happy camper. I'm glad I wrote this, it was fun. My fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but I'm sure I need to get used to that. Well, I'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. It's PROPNAME and the PROPNAME. We've done it before. It's going to be cute. I was the Duck, my friend PROPNAME(who goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME) was the Bird. She was a great dancer. She was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the Nutcracker(not PROPNAME, but the ORGNAME ORGNAME)  she shared it with PROPNAME who dance the Cat. PROPNAME is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. She was going to go to LOCNAME on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. My other good friend is PROPNAME, she's a sophomore. She is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. So those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. I love ballet, we also have this one dancer named PROPNAME, she has extension to die for. That means her leg goes all the way to her ear. She is great. I love ballet, that makes me so happy. Well, thanks for this assignment, I'll see you in class, but I doubt you'll see me!  I'll probably drop by you office sometime!  I hope this makes since! 
__label__label1 and I feel like I'm starting to get sick, and I really feel like going home for a while and forget about everything involved with college and responsibility. oh well I'm also really sick of guys and everything that they bring about in my life. not really but they seem to confuse me a lot, especially when the one I really love is way too old for me, but he is my best friend. I can't even sleep anymore because I have so much on my mind, everything that was familiar to me in my life has been dramatically changed in a period of a couple of weeks. I miss my family not like homesick but just miss being a part of my family circle. I don't feel like I truly belong anywhere anymore. when I go home all my stuff is here and I feel like I'm missing something important in my life when I'm away from home. I am really worried about money, I have a car payment due in about a week and I feel bad taking money from my parents constantly. I am still working some in LOCNAME LOCNAME but it gets hard to go back and forth every other weekend. but I'm worried about not working at all because I need money now more than ever. the real reason I don't want to quit working there is because my boss is like my best friend who I am madly in love with and who I have been in love with for the last 0 years. I miss him so much and if I don't work there anymore I'm afraid I won't get to see him anymore. that would be one of the worst things that could happen he makes me laugh I get mad at him but I get mad at him because I do love him. oh well obviously he is in my mind more than just about anything. I forget about him occasionally when I go out with my friends or other guys, but the minute I think I have forgotten about him. he calls. he called me 0 times this weekend, and it makes me wonder what is he thinking does he miss me as much as I miss him if I'm lucky the answer is yes, but he may just think of me as a really good friend. and maybe that is all we are meant to be I just want to get out in the open even though I'm sure he all ready knows. but I'm young I should only be thinking about school but that can be easier said than done 00 years. of my life was spent in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I miss everything I left behind even though I am enjoying things here too I mean it is all a new experience and I like not having to really answer to anybody but myself and God. even though I completely respect my parents it was time for me to grow up and lead my own life and make all my own decisions. that is all.    
__label__label0 I have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. I am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. It was full though, so I signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled "Introducion to Italian Culture," but I dropped it this morning, because I think it is so irrelevant to anything I am interested in, and I am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. I was signed up to take 00 hours, but since I droppped that seminar, I now have only 00 hours. Anyway, I am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is "Interior Design. "  I'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but I just thought that is worth a shot. I am sitting in my dorm, ORGNAME ORGNAME, right now, and I just figured out how to use their computers here. I did not bring my own computer, so I am having to use the computers here. I still do not know how to check my email yet, though. I just figured out how to be able and send email from here. My roommate does have a computer, but I can tell that she would prefer it if I didn't use her's, so I respect that. She has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. We knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. I was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but I think taht it will work out fine. One of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. She is the one who I am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. She got into that class. Anyway, in the dorm that I am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. PROPNAME, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. The part that I live in is bigger, but I kind of wish that I lived in the other part. The people that I live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. Oh well, I'm over across the street a lot, so I guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. I am so excited that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is starting tonight. It is a bible study that I am going to go to. I've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. I miss all of the Christian based things that I went to bakc at home. I used to go to Campus Life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. I also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. She is not much older than I am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that I go through. Not taht I have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. Speaking of problems, I did get really homesick the other day. Obviously, I guess you can tell that I am a freshman. Anyway, I got sick , adn any time I am sick I always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. But, I managed just fine. I went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and I am feeling much better today. I still am really tired though. I think that might have been why I got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. Well, I have finished the twenty minutes, but I'm sure taht this is horribly written, but I guess it doesn;'t matter. 
__label__label1 The reality that college isn't just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that I have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. I think somewhere in my mind I thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there'e more free time. Well, I know now that this will not be so. All my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. I'm really afraid that I won't know what to expect on examinations. I've spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can't imagine what I'm going to do. Reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. I also started reading my Economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that I recognized as being covered in class. I've discovered that going out every night and staying out until 0:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. The first week of school I tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. There are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and "party" and meet people every night. Externally, I'm a member of a sorority and we're supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. Internally, I feel like I'm missing out or something if I don't go. Maybe there's a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. I ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of ORGNAME that I had met at Orientation. We recognized eachother and talked for a minute. A couple days later I saw him in my EConomics class. It would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. But, great things like that usually don't happen to me. My roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. I really like them a lot. We all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. Everyone is so nice and we get along well. I especially like my roommate. We have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. We aren't in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together. Last night we stayed in and worked on our psych pretesting which took me like two hours after the UT football game. We were pretty bummed that they lost. 
__label__label0 I'm just wondering how everything is going to work out, I mean, how is my relationship going to work out if she's in LOCNAME and I'm in TExas. Well, I guess it shouldn't matter that much cause I should be thinking about school. Damn, this place gives me the creeps. No one that I can really talk to. How is anyone going to survive here. Gosh, I miss my baby. Am I making the right choices here in classes?  Am I making the right choices in my relationship?  I mean, if it doesn't work out, then what am I going to do?  My relationship . man, I'm confused. This place is big. This university is big. How am I going to stand out?  I haven't met any new friends, not very many. My room mate also sucks. I have no money. That's another thing, how am I going to survive financially?  How am I to get enough money to support my college tuition?  Mom and dad can't provide the whole thing and financial aid won't cover it all. How am I to make up the rest of the money?  And if I do get a job, how am I to balance my job and school at the same time. Gee, and how come I keep thinking of my girlfriend?  Damn, everything goes back to her. I can't believe the time I spend thinking of her. This is hopeless. I can't believe I'm even doing this relationship thing. Damn, my head hurts. I hope I'm doing this assignment right. If not, then I'm in trouble. what a way  to start out college. Man, I have a headache. I wonder if I'm dying. Ha, I wonder if I'm dying all the time. I wonder if I make myself sick by thinking about that so much?  I hope I don't get fat. I hope this college thing doesn't' make me fat and I hope that this whole college thing works out. I don't want to waste anymore of my parent's money. I don't even know what I'm doing here in college. I don't know what I want to be, what I want to do, or how the future's going to be like. Maybe I'm scaring myself. I think about this stuff too much when I should be out doing something about it. I feel so lazy and so useless. So insignificant. Is this what the real world going to be like?  Am I going to be another insignificant person?  Gosh, my head hurts. Everyone in this room looks dead. Everyone looks like they've been drained of their energy. Man, it's been only 00 minutes and I am writing a bunch of crap. Ha, I guess this is stream of conscience writing huh?  I guess it means to just talk to yourself. How come I don't see any familiar faces?  No one here is a familiar face to me. I thought I knew a lot of people but damn, I know no one. I hope things get better. I don't think I can stand much more of this. I want to go home for a while. Jester's food is getting old and I miss my parents. I just miss having nothing to do. Maybe I'm just lazy, I don't know. I can't keep thinking like this. I'm not lazy. Think positive buddy. Ha, I'm talking to myself again. I wonder what the professor's going to think about this paper?  Oh well, out of 000 some odd students in a class, I don't' think anyone's going to get to this paper. See what I mean?  InsignificantF!!!  Why so pessimistic PROPNAME?  Damn, what happened to the old you?  I guess things change huh?  I guess things are never going to be the same. Didn't you say you wanted to go to college to get away from it all?  Didn't you say that you wanted to start over?  HEre's your chance buddy. Take the risk. BE yourself. Meet people. Make yourself a significant part of something. Don't just dissapear. oh, times up. 
__label__label1 I don't really want to do this assignment, I think it's tedious and I want to go to sleep. I haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. I want to study, but I'm totally lost at what I want to do because I have so much work to do. I think I will study psychology first before I study my EE book. I miss my brother, he's so cool. Looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. This music in the background is cool, I'm glad I burned the cd today. I hope my dorm mates don't get mad that I'm turning it up so loud. I don't really care that much though. I want to go do something besides work. Everyone around here is studying, but I am not. I feel like I'm forgetting to study for something. I wish I went to see that movie last night, It sounded really cool. My neighbors are great, but I don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. I don't understand why I don't trust anyone. I wish I could trust people more, but I think I trust too much already. I don't know. I think I'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. LOCNAME seems so far away from here, I miss my family. I don't understand why people don't miss their family here, I seem to be the only one. I try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. I want them to be near me. The houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. The concert I went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. It was strange, off all the concerts I went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. It must be the type of music it is. I wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. But, I hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. I don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. Man, my trash can is full, when I'm done I think I'll throw out the trash. Why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. I hope that my computer doesn't crash again. It's built well, but I seem to be slacking off on computer studying. I don't know as much as I did or wish to. I love computers so much though. I wish I could be rich like those million or billionaires. But, then again, I don't want to be too greedy, maybe if I could just provide enough for my family. I think I wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what I do. I hope EE is what I like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. I don't think I like writing this. My hands are getting kinda strained. I think I'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, I still have another assignment to do, wow, I'm glad I remembered to do this assignment, I don't want a bad grade only 0 weeks into the school year. Okay, I think I want to finish this up. Thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, I hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. I think ill stop now. bye. 
__label__label1 At this moment I,m really thinking about what I'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. I missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. I'm munching as I do this assignment, but I don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but I don;t know why. What is it with these computers anyway, I've been screwing with mine for three weeks and I can't figure it all out. I hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. No where can I find my freaking e-mail to check it. I don't even know if I really have an address because I registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. I figured out why food and computers don't mix. My fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. I like this assignment- I/m getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. I knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. Now maybe I'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. It must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but I would probably have fun because I'm a camera hog anyway. I should have paid more attention in typing class. I know I'm not using the right "home keys" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. I hope I don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because I'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. I feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but I doubt that they are home and studying like I am. My Mom didn't call back from work. She may not have even got the message thyat I called. Mail takes way too long to get here from LOCNAME. I thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. Today's THE eighth and I just now got stuff from tyhe second. Tomorrow is PROPNAME's birthday. I guess I'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. If I was her age zi don''t know if I would want a big sister. I guess it might be neat. I hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. I don't know what she does withall herw time. She always studies but she never gets anything done. I don't do much of anything, but I always getstuff done. I guess it's time management skills. I sleep too much. I think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?  
__label__label0 I am so tired of school already and I want to go home and sleep in my bed and see all of my old friends I hate computers with a passion my stupid ethernet does not work and the front desk says there is nothing they can do all I can do is to call a number which I have been doing and getting no answer ireally miss PROPNAME but he is coming to visit the weekend after labor day there are so many people fromschool in my psy class that I cannot stand and all of my classes area assignning so much reading for us if I read what I am suppose to I'd end up reading over threehundred pages a day and there is no way thatt is possible for me to do Biology is the worst class that I have the teacher is so boring and rambles on so fast which is really pathetic since bio is my major for the time being I have had the worst headache ever sonce I've been in LOCNAME I just want to go home for a while and have my summer back it was so much nicer not doing anything all day except for hanging out with friends and parting all night I wish we could smoke inside I am on the thirteenth floor which is a pain to wait for an elevator just to smoke and when it gets cold inthe winter its really going to suck ireally don't mind any of my classes except bio but what if I drop the major and it was just because of the  teacher from this yearwho ruined it for me when if I had another teacher I might have acctually enjoyed the subject I am so tired of reading maybe I'll switch my major to math that is so much easier for me but what can you do with math besides be a teacher I really don't want to be a teacher because I hate kids I never want to have kids they are such a pain I really   don't see why any one has them tons of my friends back home have them PROPNAME's kid is the devil himself he is so crazy and he's barely three I would not be able to raise another person for eightteen years straight  my head is really starting to pound everyone heere is trying to convince me to stop smoking but I think that would drive me insane and I'd be a really bitchy  person to everyone then I probally gian a ton of weight because if I am not somking  I am eating that's another problem with this whole college thing getting fat I was ten pounds lighter like six months ago and now if I gian any more I am going to go crazy maybe I should take metabolife pills but I don't feel like driving to the mall in rush hour traffic oh well iguess I'll just watch what I eat or at least try to  I really want charley to come to austin and visit soon he is the one person I really mis  since I've been gone thats weird cause I haven't missed my brothers at all  I never really got along with them any way maybe once we grow up we'll get along better  I don't really care now anyway my head hurts so bad I think I'll take a nap before I read ay of the billions of pages that I have for homework twenty minutes is over up all done with this one 
__label__label1 Presently my thought are on my sororities 00th Anniversary this weekend. So far I have not ben able to find a place to get my hair done; which is a problem because I have very long hair. The guy that I am going with is pretty cool. We met about a week and a half ago and things are going well. Since, I have no family coming in for parents weekend I am probably going to ask him to the game but I am not sure. I mean I enjoy his company and all but the shortness of time that I have known him and that is not for 0 weeks. I don't know what to do about it but I have to ask before midnight because I need his ID so that he can be in my sororoties block at the game. Being new around here and not knowing many people is a problem when you need dates for all kinds of things. It is hard to go up and ask a guy to something who you have only talked to once or none. It's difficult being from out of state. It seems like everyone else knows everyone else. I knowe that this is not true but that is how it seems. Getting used to the whole college thing is different. I do have my sister around so that is nice but I have not lived near her for four years so in a way it is kind of strange as well. I had a bought of homesickness last week. I tried to call my best friend to hear a friendly voice but she was not home. My other best friend was there and I talked to her, well woke her up and said hi-bye kind of thing. The net was my only way to talk to them then without disturbing anyone else because my third best freind has not left for college yet. I wrote her a long letter via email and poured my heart out. With just meeting people it is kind of hard to cry on someones shoulder . I don't know I just don't like to cry in front of poeple who I do not know. don't want them to know that I have a weakness. To everyone else I like to come off as a very stronge and together person who can handle any situation. Plus, the people hear do not know me well at all and for me to start spewing off all of my problems or thoughts might put a burden on someone else or drive them away. It takes a lot for me to be able to trust someone with my feeling. My car, my clothes, anything else but not my soul. Living with another person who I had never met before was an experience unto itself. The first morning at 0:00am her boyfreind was over and stayed the entire weekend. I am glad that she is enjoying her freedom away form home but not in my room when I barely knew her. I don't like having to stay in friends rooms my first weekend at school. It just was not cool because I had just met all of them, tooo. Just a bad situation all together. I just do not like being put in that situation. I won't do it to her. If I want to hang with one of my guy friends to al hoursa of the morning I go to his place or in the lounge or something. That is just not write. Typing non-stop like this is kind of difficult. I never took tying so I am constantly looking at the keys and thinking that I am running out of things to say with much time left. Funny how your mind sort of goes blank when asked to talk about such a loose subject as your thoughts. Not too much longer. I am most of the way there. Lack of thoughts here. It is interesting to move away and to think about how different things would be if so and so did not choose this school. The girl who I have found that I have connected is from out of state too. If I didn't have her I do not know what I would do. We did not get into the same sororities but that is cool because now instaed of gluing to eachother we are meeting many other poeople. It's definitely different here than in LOCNAME. The manner that peopel have and the culture and such. I am so excited that for one of my theatre classes I get to go see the play Vieaux Carre which I am believing is based in New Olreans although I have never heard of it before. I know A Street Car Named Desire but not that one. I just do not know. 
__label__label0 When I was young, I always like to lied. I remember one day I lied to my mother that I went to library to study. But instead, I went to the nearest video game center to play arcade. When come back from home, I told my mother that I study very hard in the library. After I said that,  my grandmother smile at me for a moment which last for about few seconds. At that time, somehow I got strange feeling that something is wrong, but I am not very sure about that. I kept thinking about the wicked smile that my grandmother gave it to me within that two or three seconds. Then I decided to analyse this situation carefully. First, when I lied to mother at that moment, did I carelessly  show any sign of unordinany behavior, like shaking my body or showing a very dishonest face without I knowing it. Second, did I say something wrong or stupid, that have indirectly showed me I am lying at that moment. Third,  did my clothes have any cigarette smell?  Or did some of the people saw me enter the video game center and tell the incident to my mother?  Or is it my grandmother just want to smile and being nice to me, and I am the one who is too sensitive about the smiling incident?  Even though I made many hypothesis, but I still could not figure if something is really wrong. I am kind of nervous and just keeping thing that incident. After dinner, my mother asked me why does it take me so long to finish my study, and I told her I have a lots of homework to do. Then she said I was lying because my sister had followed me and seen me enter the video game store. At last, this incident had ended, and it also prove me that my six sense is correct. 
__label__label1 It seems weird that PROPNAME is in the same philosophy class as me since we both live in the same neighborhood back in LOCNAME, even though we have never really met each tother before. She says she is planning to bvisit houston quite often, but I don;t think I will as often as her. Its not because I don't want to go home, but its partly that I feel independent here even though not monetarily. Also, I would like to get the chance to vistit austin and get to know m y surrounding before going back to the norm and comfortableness of my true home; austin is my new temporary home. PROPNAME said he missed home the very first day; I don;t think I really miss home that much, maybe because of the contradictory or hyppocritical views I sometimes have of things in houston. I wonder if my schedule conflict involving ba000 will be settled with out further conflict; I can't afford to miss psychology atfor ba000 once a month, yet I cannot afford to lose sight of ba000. Hopefully, this PROPNAME or brian character will be able to sufficinetly change my course schedule since tex won't allow me to do it any more. It seems that I got a lot to do today, yet at the moment it doens't seem as anything is concrete, expect some homework arbitrarily. Its only been 0 minutes and its seems as though I have been typing at leat twice that long. I wonder how my mind will wonder to the next stream of unconsciousness. Philosophy seems to be an interesting class even though the reading is quite strenuous. PROPNAME must have been the master at breaking people's arguments; he would have been a great attorney or lawyer. Which reminds me, what exactly is the difference between a lawyer and an attorney? Perhaps its in how they represent people or their specific type or level of education concerning the law. The damn ethernet guy better at least give me a ring and try to help me fix the connection that was working until last thursday or so, I have called and left a message three times already and no response. Does he live in Dobie or just has a similar prefix to his phone #. Once I get the ethernet working, I won't have to come here to this computer lab and worrying abut forgetting to tyupe in my IF account #. Almost all the peoplke I have talked ot about this labor day weekend have said they will be travelling back to home; most of my friends are those from my high school, we probably are at least 00 people representing cy falls. I would like to play a pick up game with PROPNAME and see how much he has improved since the days he was with theh cypress falls basketball program. I bet jimmy is trying to get accustomed to his new surroundings at that junior college, which I can't recall the name to. PROPNAME's sister basically got the dusch from that jeff punk, I don';t think I would have confessed seeing another woman unless she was going to find out regardless; better from me than from a stranger. Unlike the infamous PROPNAME situation, Only five more minutes until I can check my mail; hopefully, somebody that is not attending LOCNAME will have written me to see how everything is going or the Panhellenic council will have finally decided to start their opening meeting. How many Greeks, true Greeks/ Hellenas , not fraternity or soririty people, are amognst me at UT. Maybe I will meet some good looking girls. I knew it was PROPNAME as soon as I saw at the ORGNAME meeting; haven't seen her since the days at TGHP. ITs weird that she knows Amber, the girl I kind of hooked up with at one fo the LOCNAME in 00, so long ago. Its alomsst time and I just read the click once to submit  button while awaiting the time to log off this thing. Only a few more minutes ; my wrist are beginning to sweat opn this uncomfortable keyboard. I keep wanting to type with my left ring finger because it feels liek it needs to be streched or so. Time. 
__label__label1 Far too many thoughts are running through my head right now. Too many things changing all around me. My main concerm=n is PROPNAME. I know it is crazy for me to think that the two of us can stay together through the year but I want to so badly. he is my best friend and there is no way I can just let myself lose him. I am just so worried about everything. we are fighting an awful lot lately vecause we need to learn to get adjusted to all the new things around us. why in the world is he at LOCNAME. He just settled there which makes me so diappointed because I want him to be happy. Not just settling someweher cause he feels like he has no other choices. And then he goes on about there not being anyone there who doesn't drink and so in order to not be alone he hads to go out with these guys  why can't he just gove it some time. He'll meet good people eventually. he just doesn't want to be alone like he was for most of high school. I can kind of understand because  he spent so much time out of hat he considered the loop. I can't really say much because all my other friends are at LOCNAME. Heck I'm even living with one of my best friends. I knew that would be a mistake but I just didn't have t eheart to turn her down so I siad we could be suitemates, not roommates. still a mistake. She is always in my business, never a moments peace. It doesn't help that she keeps aksing about matt. The sick part is that she has always liked hikm. he used to like her which makes it even worse. And she keeps trying to stay in contact with him which pisses me off. I know I can't tell him he can't talk with her but it seriuosly upsets me. especially cause she keeps busting in here asking me all kinds of questions about us. She doesn't know how much of a private person I am about certain things. If I want to talk I will share anythign under the sun. but I hate beign pressured to talk and I hate not having my space. She doesn't understand. I am a hard person to live with because I am so picky about everything. I like things my way. so livign with others is often hard. My roommmate and I get along great cause we give each other space while always being there for each other when we need it. It neat cause we hadn't met unitl last week and yet we already work on much the same level. So the whole lindsay thing just adds to the mess with PROPNAME. I am very insecure about him going away. really scared about the whole situation so it doesn;t help when I feel my best friend is after my man. I know he has nothing to do with it but why couldn't he just ignore her for me, for us. I know it is not good for us to fight like this and I don't want to but sometimes I just start expected too much. Ridiculous things that no one can be expected to live up to. but that's the way I am, I figure if I can do it others should be able to too. On that I amn very wrong but it still bothers me. I want my baby to be happy and I don't want us to trap each other in a relationship that isn't healthy but I'm not ready to let go. I still think that if we just get settled it will all work itself out. I just can't have PROPNAME behind me all the time interupting our conversations. I just feel that he always has to go before we can really finish somehting. And then there are my parenst who are so weird. now that I am gone they try and contact me more. They I'm and email but never call. then they blame nme, why haven't you called. well first of all yall are tryign to see me more than you did while I was home, secondly, wy don't you call. That drives me crazy. I really don't miss anyone except matt. That isn't really suprising to me though because I have never been one to miss my family . And most of my really close friends are here. Which is interesting in itself. LOCNAME is the last place I ever thought I would end up. I always wanted to go to PROPNAME and then on the last day I suddenly changed my mind. Not sure all the reasons why. sometimes I say it is because ORGNAME had the program I wanted, at PROPNAME I really didn't have a major. But other times I think I was just too chicken. Too chicken to pick the harder school. I knew I could handle it but I didn't know if I wanted too. Then there were my parenst who for some reason pushed ORGNAME. Not gform the beginning, but somewhere along the line, I think when my dad saw the scholarship. Then he went form die hard Rice to, "I think you'd be better off at ORGNAME. "  I didn't want to do the same things my friends were doing. I wanted something new. And heere I am with one of my friends in the same room. now that is a stretch. My best friend other than matt is PROPNAME and who knew but she pulle done of the same things and ended up at LOCNAME too. So really there is no one to miss except my baby and iZ am takign that really hard. It's hard to believe  I acn't see him until Christmas. And talkign over the internet just isn't the same. I just want everything to settle down and my emotions to caslm down so that I am not so fickle with everything and don't act irrationally. I never mean to hurt him but PROPNAME today Irealized that I have been. Now as I talk it sounds like we shouldn't stay together but we have sommmuch fun tigether and I think that this is justa phase. we are both stressed. I hope my roommates don't get all weird on me and start thinkign I'm getting depressed. I really just need some space and a little time to adjust. 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about what all my friends are doing. I just finished emailing them for the first time since I figured out how to do email in the computer lab. Its wierd being away from home. But I've decided I fel only as if I am away to cheerleading camp and its just a little longer that it normally is. I am loving college life so far. I feel like I've been managing my time fairly well, but I get annoying constantly when I feel somewhat disorganizee. There is a lot to remember and things that I guess we are supposed to know as freshamn that I have no clue about. I just joined a sorority and I am stating to realize how time- demanding it is. But my grades are far more important to me. I am nervous about my classes because in high school I was used to A's (except in chemistry). I am hopefully going to tranfer from engineering to business possible business honors if I do well enough so I want to do really well. I have been doing my readings, but I was never the best test taker. I am not used to the big classes, and tey make me uncomfortable thats why I would love to be in an honors program where the classes are smaller. I am the type of student who likes to have a perwsonal relationship with my teachers, and I don't feel like I can approach them in such a large setting. People who know me find this to be odd because I am nortmally quite outgoing no matter the situation. Today during class, we talked about how a majority of first year students go through depression. I think I've been trying to avoid it by keeping very busy, but I guess I somewhat am. I miss my family and my best friend vera at southwest. I even miss my teachers aned my old high school. AT my high school everyone knew who I was and rspected me, or looked up to me in a way. I was a cheerleader, and the top of my class. Here I'm just a number. But I'm the type of person who likes challenges, so I don't think its depression. I just look at this experience as another challenge to face in order to achieve success at a higher level. My classes and teachers are all really good- which I expected since I spent a majority of orientation researching them. I just hope I have success in all my classes. I would really love to go home at Christmas with  a 0. 0 which I don't think is completely unreasonable. A lot of people are counting on me to do well, my parents, my family (0 younger brothers and sisters), my extended family. Its almost stressful. There is so much to do hre in LOCNAME. It is fun but I will need to prioritize Sun-Thur. Its wierd not having anyways to tell you what to do, or when to do it. But its also nice to not have the responsibility of 0 other family memebers. I always had to make sure I didnt need t0o help my parents with  driving, babysitting, or house work before I got to do any of my own things. They definelty relied on me less second semester which was really cool of them. I have much more free time then last year too because I ony have to worry about myself (that sounds selfish) but I don't need to check up on 0 other peoples lives before I take care of my own business. Of coure, I still make it my business to know what they are doing because our family life was gret. There are so many personalities. We are all so unique, and it was definetly a challenge learning how to cope and adapt to each one. I think my parents are stil having fun doing it- I bet theyre glad to have gotten rid of one- but at the same time they miss me - I know. I think I have the best parents ever. They love me so much!!!!   
__label__label0 Ugh! Look how nasty and scary that thing is. How stupid he was to stay in the car with that object? Well this a very scary movie, and the only I have seen in a log while, its my roomates faults. Oh, she is a traitor, how about that, never thought it would be her. Isn't there better ways to express your feelings, instead of cussing. The monster got her how gross, and what a painful death. It must of hurt, duh, and the guy trying to save should of just left before he became a victim too. Again another ironic thing the teams leader is who never suspected. Her naked body proves it, why is he so crazy to believe her words. Words speak louder than actions. Look how she transformed her body and the other one is one of her. Man, boy I am getting really frightened of this. My body has chills has the end is narrowing. I have an itch behind my ear,on my leg, foot and head I think due to the fact that I am so scared of the movie and the events that are about to happen. My eyes are widening due to the good guys escape. My head itches more. Yeah he made it I'm happy for. There is one for the good guys. 
__label__label0 This is an interesting assignment to be doing. I don't like writing but this is different. I like being able to wrinte whatever pops into mw head and not worry about it being scrutinezed by an evil english teacher. Twenty minutes is a long time to be writing though. I could be doing sometinhg like playing a game of starcraft or half life right now, or writintg some c code. I am going to implement a router advertisement program to take advantage that windows boxes are stupid and let me remotly rewrite thier routing rules. Its nice of them to do this for me, but  I'll do that later. I wonder if I should write it under windows or Linux, or sine ither flavor of unix. I'll prob write it under windows if I gan get the neccesary access to the transport layer of the protocol stack just for that change of writing something usefull for windows. I actually have written some useful software for windows. Most of it would easily cross compile to unix. A fun peice of code I wrote takes a string such as "sin(x)^0-0**0-x^(e^x)" and evaluates it as a mathematical expression for a given value of x. If you've ever written code, this is not easy to do. I am listing to music right now. It helps stimulate the mind. :) I usually listen to music when programming. I am more productive that way. I am able to apporach problems and dig out the answer of some nasty place its hiding. 00 minutes sure is a long time when you would rather be doing something else. How many points do I get for doing this anyway. After I do thins I may go and eat or spend some time with PROPNAME, my girlfriend, who also happens to be my fiance  :)  she's great. After that I can write my router advertisement program. That would be fun. I love melissa. Being in austin is great. I like it much better that being in san antonio. I want there last weekend and wanted to be back up here the whole time. That could have been because all y stuff is up here. My parents miss me though. I sohuld call them. I;ll do that later. I have a lot of homework to do. Lets see, I'll check the chem web site after this and see what problems I have to do. I have to do the other assignment for this class later, and read. I have 0 sections of math, and reading and some homework in double E, college of engineering is college. I am a computer engr. student. EE is probably my best calss this semester, but psych is next, math is boring because it is going too slow (don't tewll my prof I wrote that) and I just don't like chem, the highlight of the class is when dr white starts singing. He is a weird guy. only 0 minutes before I can hit submit. I like ORGNAME. its a fun place to be. I need to buy another compputer. I host a site that provides free domain and web hosting to whoever wants it, and the boxes I have right now are slower thatn anything. I also need to call network soulutions and beat the m up until they do their jobs. I am hot. My apartment complex needs to fix the air conditioning. That would be good. aLl my roomates are in san antonio for the weekend, but I stayed here. I should call my parents later. That would be nice. I love melissa. 0 minutes left. my attention span is shortening. I will write my router advertisement prog first because melissa is sleeping. I need to go to ORGNAME and buy some sprite. I havent had any in a could days. Since shool has started I have gone through 0 00 packs. Tonioght I am going to try this company called midnight taco's for dinner. they sound good and operate between 0pm and 0am. I hope the food is good. I want a job, but a good one like I had in san antonio. I would like to put some moniy into my bank acct rather than just withdrawing it. That would be good. I only have 0 more hours of experiments to do, it will be nice to finishe them. I love melissa 0 minutes left I am hitting the submint button at exactly 0:00 , even if I am in mid-sentance. I need to turn the music back on, it finished playing, htats better, I can't spell (thats is waht I meant) rage againsta the machine is on. 0 more minute. PROPNAME is great. Shool is good, it will get better once I get into my major sequence. Time for me to go soon, I want that clock to say 0:00, the phone is ringing. bye 
__label__label1 I find your instructions extremely vague and confusing, I should hope your instructions would be more precise as to what you actually want, considering this is college. However, I will attempt to explain how "my mind works. "  At the moment, I am tired so I am in a cloudy state of mind. To be completely honest I am thinking I would rather be doing many other things with my friends than writing a prompt. I am also hungry because I have not eaten all day. Food is presently being prepared at my co-op so I am not particularly worried about starving. I find that if I something to be misleading or too broad, such as this writing assignment, I tend to get frustrated and pist off. Hence I tend to speak my opinion if I am in this state of mind. I am presently thinking about how much of a moron the person who wrote this assignment must be to try and make me think about my thoughts and then write about my thoughts as I was thinking about my thoughts. Sounds a little too contradictive to me. How could I think of any thoughts to write about when my thought is supposed be me thinking about my thoughts? I have found that I'll have an idea sometimes out of the blue, sometimes when situations spring them upon me. Whether the idea registers as a good one or not in my brain at the time, determines if I decide to take action, ponder it more, or dismiss it. My feelings at this point are that I would rather be having sex than writing a prompt as well. I could simply click a few buttons and check out some internet porn but I might as well keep writing. I feel even more tired now because I just got done shopping for four hours for my co-op. I don't particularly care very much for shopping but I do it because it is part of my duty to everyone at the co-op. I could use some music but am not near a stereo. Which brings up an important thought. I tend to ponder the ways and means of life when I play my own music better. I find that I helps me cope with and express my ideas in a form that is universal instead of English. My mind comprehends a thought and then interprets it as emotion or reason. Based upon the interpretation, my mind then clarifies what emotion or reason is to be felt or used and then determines a course of action. In the case of music, it sends impulses to my soul to tell my fingers what to play and in the case of reason it tells me what is rationally sound to deduce from my initial observations. 
__label__label1 well I don't know what to say but I think I should start by sayin I'm really beginning to appreaciate the little things of life. I always have but learning about the body is facinating. the brain especially. there have been times when I feel things and wonder, but I'm now getting some answers due to this book. the class we havnt learned much but the book I've gone ahead. i think about all kinds a things. mostly music and social justice. besides psyc, I got bio which is boring so far but I know I like it . my other classes r mexican american study classes which are all intertwing, or overlap. i think college is coo so far, but for other people I'm sure its harder for others. u se e I've always pretty much been alone, besides my mom. my parents divrced when I was 0, and ever since then my father figures have been in a almost constant shuffle. from my stepdad, to my uncle, to a rapper that I consider my biggest influence, and the last 00 years later my dad. i feel alota anger deep down but have always been able to control it. most of the  time but we all have outlashes I guess. now I am just starting to reach a stable state,,I'm here finally,,no more anticipation,,I'm off weed and drinking,,but the main issues are always family and my lady. shes still in san jose, ca where I'm from. i don't know if I should be faithful or what but I think so. weve talked about a lot a things in our year together and I've taen a lot a shit out onher. i miss every0 a lot but I'm a strong person that can overcome it. always have. adversity is a part of my life that I take in stride. u have too. i see all these others here adapting and hardly any look happy,,they look all fake but maybe its just cuzz I'm on the outside just the way I like it. i'm a chicano here and it seems 00% are all white and 0% asian, 0% black , and 0% other. i also don't like it cuzz I havent really been far from campus cause no car and its to hot to take the bus. I love the bus cause I get to see all the poor people that I love associating wiht. the other homeboys and girls in the struggle or the older mexicans. u can learn a lot from talking to strangers or just observing. thats what I've always done at home and I look forward to doing it here. thats y I came here instead of miami,,cause theres mexicans here. i got a lota pride and love for my people. thats y sometimes my relationship tears me apart. my lady is white. i don't know how it happened,,we started as nothing and ended up being perfect. but llike everyhting I think theres a reason and I know if its meant to be I can work through it. i liked the part of the text that talked about anger and the balence of hapiness we all achieve,,,money doesn't make any0 better. in y opinion its almost like it makes potentially good people worse. but theres always exceptions. power is the other main curropter. or do people currupt power,,,who knows. i've always known that sensations were the vary things to guide ur life. they come from somewhere and I couldnt say where. i think god. gods everywhere. i don't go to church but in my heart I'm going the right direction, doing the right things. thats y u feel what u feel. ur direction and what u want to become. people don't realize that. and sometimes unfortuanatly people are very impressionable. especially in our society, putting aside color, gender, socioeconomic, everything,,,theres very few people that fight through it. i know iam 0 but I also know its harder to stay on top than just getting ther . i look forward to proving that I belong here 
__label__label0 At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know "everything" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy. 
__label__label0 I'm sitting here in my dorm room wondering and thinking about everything I have to get done by tomorrow. It's not a lot but just little things. I have to buy a speech book, read the first two chapters out LOCNAME it, write a speech and type an outline for it that's due for tomorrow. We don't start giving the speeches until Friday though so I'm not to worried about it. I also need to go over my chemistry. I'm going out to eat at the Hula Hut for dinner tonight with my pledge class. That should be fun. I can't wait to see my boyfriend. He is going to school at the LOCNAME of LOCNAME and it's so hard not being able to see him whenever I want. Oh well. His birthday is Sept. 00 so I'm going to go home to see him. I can't wait for this weekend becasue there is so much to do. We have a match with the SAE's on Fridayl, the game is Saturday afternoon, and then some of my friensds and I are going to go float down the river. I guess I should throw in some study time now and then. i'm really hungry but she is not coming to get me until six o'clock for dinner. I really need to do some laundry too. I'm running out of clean t-shirts. I can do that later though. I'm off to study some more and do what ever. 
__label__label1 Alright, this is going to be pretty random, so whomever may be reading this should be pretty amused. Hmmm. . i had my audition for the "Madrigal Dinner" tonight. I think it went pretty well. I sang a song that I wrote. He seemed pretty impressed. I find out Monday morning if I made it or not. I think until then I am going to have a nervous tick thing happening. I broke up with my boyfriend this weekend. He is really stupid, "dumber than a box of hair" as I like to say. That sounds pretty mean, but he really is. He isn't going anywhere. He is a 0th year high school student. If you carry on a conversation with him that involves a word with more than 0 letters, he is lost. Unless it is about auto mechanics. Then he will talk your ear off. Or if it is about drugs, he can talk 000000 miles an hour on that subject. We were just too different. I'm not into drugs and stuff and I am 00 and already in college. He is a pot head (along with other things) and he's 00 and still in high school. He is going nowhere. He wrote me a really shitty letter today. It made me feel like crap. It was along the lines of "I am nothing. You are too good for me. I should have known that the second I got something good I would lose it. "  How am I supposed to respond to somthing like that?????  My friends said it was his feeble attempt to win me back. A very feeble attempt. I am not conned into taking someone back because they make me feel guilty for ruining their life. I feel really bad though, because his parents absolutely adored me. I was everything they wanted him to be. I am fairly intelligent, Christian, drug-free, etc. I feel kinda like I let them down. But I wasn't getting to him. I couldn't change him. It's not my fault right??  What could I do?  I can lead him to the right path, but I can't force him to change. I showed him what PROPNAME did for my life, did in my life, what influence God had over me. But he was so stuck on his paegan ways. He told me he was going to quit drugs for me, but he never did. I can't be with someone for the sole reason of trying to change them. I don't know. I miss my ex-boyfriend. Not the same guy. A different one. We went out for 0 years, then he slept with my best friend. On that ridiculously long survey that we had to do for this class, that "worst depression" stuff was caused by him. 0 years!!!  And then he just threw it all away. Gosh, I miss him terribly. Sometimes I still cry at night thinking about him. I have yet to find a love so strong like I had with him. Have you ever felt that?  That feeling like you know, I don't know exactly what you know. You just know something. That feeling deep inside. That feeling noone else can give you. I had that with him. We were even engaged. Engaged!!  He made me feel like I was something worth having. Well, until he screwed my EX best friend. Stupid whore!  I'm not bitter. Hehehe, anyway. I don't know. Sometimes he is all I can think of. I'll catch myself comparing other guys to him. Every other guy I have dated has been compared to him. Should I put a name to "him"?  His name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I always have this emptiness inside me. I didn't feel empty with him. It was like he made me complete. And when he left, he took a big part with him. I know that sounds trite, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. Just pure emptiness. I got so depressed after the "incident"  that I didn't have the will to do anything. Nothing. I just laid there in bed. I would be in a trance through school just to come home and lay there. didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, didn't sleep. I never slept, but I was never awake either. It was like I was one of those vegetable people who was purely living because of the machines they are hooked up to. There was this invisible machine keeping me alive, and that was it. I was just existing. That's the word I was looking for. Existing. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried to make it less. Have the scars to prove it. Nothing I'm proud of. I had just reached the lowest I have ever felt. I'm sure it will happen again. I'm only 00. I'm sure I will find another guy that will fill the void PROPNAME left, but then he will leave me too. So what's the use anyway?  Dating is just a vicious circle. Someone is bound to get hurt. If not you, then the other person. Unless of course you find that one person that doesn't have the urge to bang one of your friends. But shit, that even happens in marriages. You think you found that one person that won't screw you over, and what happens? They screw some younger, prettier girl. Gosh, I'm really bitter. When did I get this bitter??  Is it bitterness or cynicism?  I can never tell the difference. Maybe I'm a little (or a lot) of both. <Deep sigh>  One minute left. Okay, now I'm depressed. I was in a good mood after my audition. Then I get to thinking. Damn thinking. It never does me any good. I always seem to think about things that depress me. I think it is because all of my good memories are linked to painful ones. So I try to think of good ones, but it just takes a turn for the worse. Adios! 
__label__label1 I don't know what exactly I am supposed to write about. and I think about how much time I spend trying to perfect everything in my classes, but when does that ever go through. I think that there is so much to do and I have no time to do it it. the stress keeps growing and growing. I am a bad typer so this won't be as long as it should be biut I don't really care I keep fixing my mistakes even thoigh I know I am not supposed to I thik that my hand will start to hurt really soon after so much typeing that I am going to inevitablly have to take a break soon but I ll just keep going psy seems to be an interesting courseso far and I am looking forward to listening to some of the lectures. thinking/ I don't know what else I am supposed to type about so I am going to write words that don't mean anything to me I miss my mom and my family and I miss my exboyfeind even though we had a bad breakup, I don't know if this is approriate for this assigninment or not but I sometimes I think that my thoughts go in weird directions and I think abnormal thoughts that people don't usually think about but then again I am just another teenager who is full of life and evenerygy anf I I someimtes wish that my teenage days were over and I could then setlle down and do something useful with myselfv but I love being young I wouldnt give this up for the world and to know that in a couple of years I am going to be off doing sothing that will whats the word I am looking for effect, thats it, the rest of my life and the way that I live and the people I will be freiends with and the people I will work for what exactly do I have to do to make things work out for me/ what exactly do I have to prove to people to show them that I deserve respect and a good life/ I think this typing is a waste of my time because I am not even getting anything done and I haVE so miuch reading to do and I have better things to do than to type this and no one is even going ot read this it angers me that I have to spnend 00 mins on something no one is even going to look at there are about 000 people in my class and I doiubt anyone will know who I am for a long time f even ever. I wish that I never sined up for this classs as a freshman. I wish I could go home and not be stuck in a place like this and I wish things could change for me. I don't know how I am supposed to think about the way I think. I think thats stupid no one understans fully how the brain works. no one will ever understand the way I work and I wish they would all stop trying. I live my life for everyone else iu thats wrong, but I can't ever live up to any expectauions and it upsets me. I will most likely grow up to become a psyco! thats all. I'm stopping now. PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label1 Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, PROPNAME, and then my other best friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. Me and PROPNAME would go to ORGNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end.

__label__label1 College is awesome. There are so many good-looking girls. The atmosphere is free and open. I wish we didn't have class so I could go out and party every night. Partying has been fun. I get drunk, but I know my limit. I go where ever the party. Free beer is always good. I don't understand why the Asians frats have a cover charge to get in. There is not a lot of alcohol, and the parties suck. Although I'm Asian, I can't stand them. Asian guys dress weirdly, and the girls look funny. I associate myself with the whites. I grew up in a white neighborhood. I didn't have a white friend until I moved to LOCNAME which was 0 years. I only have a handful of Asian friends. Whites are a lot more fun to hang out with. They're more open and do whatever. I prefer my girlfriend to be white. In the past, I had 0 white girlfriends and 0 Asian girlfriend. Right now, I would like a white one, but I'm going after an Asian one. She is not like the others. She doesn't really like Asians either. She is half Japanese and half Vietnamese. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. She also happens to be in the same pyschology class. She sits next to me most of the times. I always sit next to my best friend, PROPNAME. He is cool. He knows when to party. I have a lot of friends in there, and most of them are from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. There so many PROPNAME students in there and at LOCNAME. That reminds me, the girl who sat next to me today would not quit laughing. At first, I thought she was cool. Things changed as the lecture progressed. The girl who sat in the row behind me, 0 seats to the right wearing the red PROPNAME shirt was good looking. I wish I was white so I could approach white girls with better ease. Man oh man. There so many pretty girls in that class. Microeconomics has a lot too. Especially the one two rows down from me. I normally sleep in that class, but she kept me awake. Damn. I wish I approached her. PROPNAME is an excellent place to eat. A lot of girls eat there. My parents are bringing up my bike on Saturday, and I'm excited. I definitely need a bike. They'll probably take me shopping and out to lunch. I probably take my roommate and woman along. My roommmate is pretty cool. Could be an asshole at times, but who isn't?  We went to school together. We have three classes together including pysch. Right now, I'm pissed at PROPNAME. He is one of my friends and is also in the pysch class. He won't shut up. He is starting to get annoying. He says a lot of stupid things. He doesn't like ORGNAME or something. When he is wrong, he will try to do some bullshit that makes him look right. Such an idiot. My Eco teacher is so stupid. Such an FOB. I just sleep in it now. Computer Science is so hard. I might drop it. That's it for now. 
__label__label0 well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 0rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the "rountine" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the ORGNAME meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at LOCNAME. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to ORGNAME yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 0 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon. 
__label__label0 I'm stressed out about my Calculus class I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish all the homework and be able to get an A in the class. I really want to make an A because that would increase my prospects at getting a good first job, of course that would only be good for a first job. I really don't like my job at ORGNAME it is really annoying, all people seem to be in a bad mood all the time and I don't find it that enjoyable. If I were somehow rewarded with more money I think it might be managable however, because I can't seem to get a raise out of them I'm going to look for another job. I hope my typing doesn't wake up my roomate my girlfriend is really distressed about our relationship I guess I'll have to write her an e-mail and make things better between us. How I would describe love right now, I've always thought that you had different degrees of love throughout your life, I would say that I love her however. i really hope my roommate is a deeper sleeper than I think he is because I know I would be annoyed if he were typing where I could hear it. Tommorrow I have to go get my Economics book in the morning and read part of that, college seems so stressful, I don't know if I'm going to be able to budget my time. The bookstores rip you off you pay all that money for books and then they buy them back cheaply and then sell them for the same price that you bought them for. That might be a good way to make some money buy opening a bookstore. My dad was telling me how having a low overhead would produce a lot of profits for something on the internet. I had better be quiet so my roomate doesn't hear me, but the noises in the hall are louder but not constent. He has too wake up at 0:00 in the morning to go to class. I don't know how well we are getting along, I guess he is an ok roommate but I wanted him to be a little more outgoing. I guess I'm going to have to meet people on my own which I'm not all that good at but I guess I'll have to try. I need to find out what my rights are in this room and if I'm able to type till just 00:00 or if I can type and make noise till one. I'm willing to try and make it as comfortable for him as I can because I want to fit in with him, but I don't know if I should draw any lines or not. I have all this homework and I don't know what to do about my time management. He just got up was it my fault or did he get up on his own, I don't want to intrude on his space but where does mine come in. I really like my computer it has everything I want it to have, but the company I ordered my graphics card for went out of business where am I going to get another graphics card. I wonder what else I'm going to have to do for homework, I hope it will be easy. I want to graduate early but can I do it or am I going to have to go all four years, if I graduate early I might have some money left for a car, I would really like a corvette but the insurance on them is so expensive especially until I'm 00. I don't know if I can handle doing all this stuff and do my homework as well, with my girlfriend and friends and still have time to work on the weekends time is suck a valuable asset. what else do I have to do. 
__label__label1 Life is ever changing. Nothing remains the same yet, you keep everything with you. Every good thing that has made you happy and every bad thing that has changed you in one-way or another. Right now I miss him. I feel love and sorrow. Lose for what we never found. Why wasn't I the one. OR instead, Am I the one who he needs?  I hate questions that keep me up at night. You tell yourself, "Go to Sleep. You have a big day ahead of you"  But does your mind pay any attention to what your body needs?  No, never. So, I find myself wondering what he is doing and what he is thinking. Is he okay?  Not caring if he is with someone else, just wishing him happiness. I hate myself for being so nice. People use me and don't even bother to thank me for that. Is that to much to ask, A simple "Thank You"?  I am greatfull for lots of things. For my mother and father and grandmother. By the way I wish she were hear. Sadness with a touch of happiness runs through my body as I think of her. As I think of when I was two years old and would help her clean the house. About all the days she made sure I went to school and did my homework. Especially of the day she left us. The day she left me. I was running. I remember I wanted her and she couldn't say anything. All I wanted was to say "Thank You" for all the love she showed me. I guess that is why I say Thank You for everything now. I should have told her that she ment everything to me. Well, I did, but I don't know if she heard me. It is because of her I am who I am today. Not only that, it is because of her that I am here. The world should be a better place. Not for anyone in particular. No, just everyone. People should be happy with who they are inside. If not, than it is difficult to reveal yourself to anyone. How many people do you know that became who they are or accomplished what they have by being true to themeselves?  I don't know many. Sure, I'm only 00, (well 00 next week) but life has not been easy to me either. When I think of my childhood I don't have fond memories. Most people I know would easily go back to the days they had no worries as children. Well, not I. I hated being a child. Even then everyone took control of me. Starting at the age of six my brother sexually abused me. Can you imagine that?  My own brother. Sure, I forgave him, but he wasn't the last. I don't remember how many people messed with me as a child, I try my best not to think of that time-period. Though I do remember that I wanted to be better a better person when I grew up. I wanted to leave and never return to the pain. Now I am strong. Stronger than what most percieve me to be. I love everyone despit the fact people are harmful. I trust everyone despite the fact people are decietful. Most importantly, I am happy. Though I do miss holding him:) 
__label__label0 Why in the world am I doing this at one thirty in the morning?  On a weekend?  I hope teri doesn't get back until Tuesday, I can't wait to switch rooms. It's funny that she complained about me too. I haven't figured that one out yet. radio stations come in better at this time of day. I kinda wish I was able to go home, I don't like being on a deserted campus. mark is getting annoying. not really. I just don't know what to tell him because I've never been in his situation before. and it's frusterating to have him ask me for advice, and not have any to give him. I love him to death, and it hurts that he's upset and I can't do anything about it. he reminds me of daddy, that's probably why we get along so well. PROPNAME is not the person I thought she was. I can't believe that we were all friends not 0 months ago. I guess I should have noticed, she did the same thing to zack and thomas. I don't understand how someone so smart can be so wild. those two traits don't usually go together. I wonder if PROPNAME is having fun at the lake. she's lucky to have her family live so closely. why does this campus insist of having concert by people who are so outdated?  why can't creed come or some band like that? this isn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. I feel guilty about going not going to church. listening to this tape shouldn't be a substitituion for actually going. I think that's what scared teri so much, all the Bibles on my desk. Oh well. Something tells me that my non Christian friends are rubbing off on me more than my Christian ones. I'm hungry, but I don't want any of the pizza that's in the frig. I want to go to pappadeux's. i wonder if a bus runs out there. frog legs would be great right now. my head is starting to hurt. PROPNAME was pretty good, I wish I would've read it in high school. gosh I miss thlp. I wonder how much better I would have liked school if it had been just like that. stephen hasn't gotten in touch, I wonder what's up with that. I hope he finds his basketball skills again, it'd be a shame to waste them. he needs to take a break he does too much stuff. this buddy list thing is going to kill me. I shouldn't have it up when I'm doing homework, it's too much of a distraction. I wonder if I have any oreos. 
__label__label0 Right now I am tired, sleepy, and restless. Stressed about finishing work and school. I have a lot of work to get done before going to school. I want to get off to a good start this year and not fall behind. I need to finish this assingnment and get to others before school starts. I'm hungry and I need to make some food along with other things I need to do. I think I'll make a sandwich. I also need to take a shower before I go. I need to get my clothes out of the dryer so I have something to wear. I think I'll wear shorts today. I'll also wear a baseball cap. I want to pickup a cd on my way back from school today. Also need some groceries. I hope I don't have much homework tonight. Only a few more days until the weekend. I'm going to LOCNAME this weekend, that will be fun. This is a three-day weekend. I'm looking forward to having three days off. I'll probably hang out with friends and go to a movie this weekend. Oh, yeah, PROPNAME is back in town this week. I'll probably hang out with him this Friday, cause Saturday morning I have to go out of town. What is today?  Tuesday. That means I only have two classes today. That's pretty good, but the next two days are pretty long days, and then Friday is another short day. My 00 minutes is  almost up. I'm glad I got this writing assignment done and out of the way. Well, I guess that's it.  
__label__label0 I feel stressed as there is not enough time for anything. Will this ever slow down. Always things, always processes. I am glad school has started again, yet  I am worried how everything will turn out. I am angry with my step mother. A death in the family has made me depressed, and happy at the same time because I know that she is no longer hurting and is in a happier place. I am frustrated with growing out my hair. My dads and my relationship has grown since our talk last week. I am dissapointed in the way I acted a couple of days ago. I hope my dads and my relationship continues to grow and build. I am ready for the heat to go away it is miserable out side. I feel dissapointed in myselfif I don't work out daily, and I probably shouldnt. I love my new apartment, but sometimes I feel lonely. I think I will like all of my classes this year because they all seem very interesting. I need to enjoy something to do well in it. 
__label__label1 I am bored, I don't know what to write. I think that I am going to enjoy college. I miss my friends and family from back home, but I am starting to mak new friends here. I will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. If I do go, I want to make sure that I will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that I went I didn't really get mush time to sleep, so I was pretty tired on my way back. I have been tired all week long now. I went to bed after midnight last night and then I had to get up this morning at five so that I could go do the PT test for the airforc ORGNAME. We didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. I wish that we could have worked out too. I really hate it while I am doing it, but afterwards I feel pretty good. Tuesday, when I got done with my PT test, I started throwing up on the field. I was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when I had to start the two mile run. My time for the run went up a minute. I will try to get that back down. I want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. I want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. But I care more about those than the run. I need to make up an excercise schedule for the ROTC. I don't really know when I want to do everything. I will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. Since I have to wake up at five on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. I will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, I will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. That should be plenty of excercise. I will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. I wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but I barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. I think that I will like it in the ORGNAME ORGNAME. It doesn't look like I had thought that it would be. They were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on TV. It looks a little more respectable that the ORGNAME. I hope that I will like it. On Tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 0000 dollar scholorship. I want to find out what they had to do to get them. Someone said that to get it you have to have a 0. 0 ORGNAME. I'll bet that there is more to it than that. But I want to try to get a 0. 0 anyways. If I have to get a loan, it will look better. It will also make me more elligible for scholorships. I am going to need the money. NExt year,   I think that I will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. I think that I would like that more than living in a dorm. It is too noisy here. My roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and I always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. I know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when I am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, I just want to scream. But next year I will have my own place by myself. That will be nice. The only problem will be that I will have to cook for myself. I don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. That probably won't be very nourishing. I will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. Maybe PROPNAME and I could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while I go to school. She could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. But I don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. I would really like to help her out, but I don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that I helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. It was very irritating, also. Still, she is a very good friend that I know will always care for me. She is very nice. I just don't think that she is very good handling money. But not everyone is good at that. She is very good with kids, and I'm not very good with them at all myself. I never know what to say to them. I start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, I run out of stuff to say. My cousin PROPNAME liked me pretty much though. My mother was telling me about how he was so excited that I always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. But I was pretty bored when I was watching him. I couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. It wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour. 
__label__label0 I am so completely upset with my mother. We used to be so close and now she has turned evil on me!  She's mad about my cell phone bill, well then why did she buy it for me?  I called her the majority of the time anyway. It's not like I was calling PROPNAME or PROPNAME!  I think I- aggh, she seriously thinks I have nothing better to do up here then listen to her bitch about money. I'm trying to earn a college education so I don't have to worry about money. Not that a degree will magically erase all of life's problems, but it will always let me have something to fall back on. I wish I didn't have so much to do. I have a t least 0 chapters to read for each class, and I overslept this morning, so I missed Geography! Oops, I'm seriously not too interested in how the prehistoric man evolved into what we are today, but it seems rather important that I memorize it all now for the sake of the essay test yet to come. What's that all about anyway, essaytests?  Why not just give mc tests like the rest of the world? How boring would that be to read 000 essays over geography? Feel kinda bad for that man. I think that college should come with a scheduled in nap time. Everyone gets tired, it should just be one extra hour where you take your mat and blanket just like in kindergarden and go to your assigned building and sleep! If you show up you get a C if you doze off and on you get a B and if you knonk out you get an A!  Sounds good doesn't it!  It could count as an elective, and those with the hardest classes and the furthest to walk would get to register first!  I'm so smart I scare myself!! Just kidding, well. I still need to find brown shoes. Brown dress shoes, I have this brown dress to wear to this 00th anniversary party, and I don't have shoes!  I feel kinda like the girl in clueless. ohmygod, no shoes whatever will I do?  Seriously, after I enactmy nap time plan, I am going to create a brown dress shoe company. I will make a fortune, because I will be the only person in the world that makes brown shoes!  One day. I have a monster headache, I think it's my contacts, I should probably change them, has it been two weeks? I don't think so!  I'm a responsible person, I just forget to do things sometimes! I had to got to the postoffice today. That was neat. I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like a dumb teenage girl who had never been in any sort of public "Official" place. I'll try to stay away from there. Well it's been 00 min! Goodbye!    
__label__label0 I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend PROPNAME is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don't want him to think I don't care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named PROPNAME who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as "college doesn't change me. " He is a TA at ORGNAME and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in LOCNAME together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn't mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game. 
__label__label1 I'm feeling tired because I just ate and I'm concerned about finishing my chemistry homework for tomorrow. I need to go through two more chapters today and then review all six of them by Thursday for the test. I've fallen behind because I was unable to get anything done last weekend because I went back home to LOCNAME. I also didn't get anything done yesterday because I again I had to go back to LOCNAME for the funeral of one of my friends from high school that got killed. He was driving to LOCNAME to meet his roommate and had to swerve to miss a deer. It was pretty sad considering he had most of his life in front of him. His car flipped three times and he was crushed. I found out yesterday at the service that he had a rosary in his pocket when he died. interesting. I just noticed that the ORGNAME won there ninth game in a row. I'm thinking about going to medical school after I got my degree in Architectural Engineering. I want to be a psychiatrist if I don't continue my study of Architectural Enginnering. I've got myself listed as being in pre-med. It so happens that 00 of my 00 hours also count towards the completion of pre-med. That was one of the best things that happened when I went to Freshman Orientation in the summer. When I went to see my advisor, she reentered my registration code and it will allow me to register for non-engineering required pre-med classes like biology, etc. Chemistry is pretty easy right now, it's just that we are going at a really fast pace. I hope that he (Dr. PROPNAME) slows down pretty soon. At this rate, we will be through with the book a month early. He's already covered six chapters in two-and-half weeks. One of the other classes (the one with my roommate) is still on Chapter 0. I wonder what I'm going to do for dinner tonight. My roommate and I were trying to decide earlier if we should go out or if we should just make sandwiches in the dorm. At any rate, we both have homework and studying to do, so when and if we go it will probably be late. It doesn't really matter when we go since we don't have to get up early for class tomorrow. The only day I have to get up early is on Tuesday. I have a Geology for Engineers lab at 0AM. It's an easy lab, but the Geology for Engineers class itself looks difficult. I really like everyday except Tuesday because I can stay up late and study, or go out and not have to worry about getting enough sleep. It fits my schedule perfectly. I notice that my time is almost up. I have another one of these to do tomorrow. I should have got started sooner. I missed lunch today because I didn't get back into town until it was too late. After I got in, my roommate and I went to go workout. Sunday is usually our off day, but we decided to go max-out on the bench press. We usually go workout everyday except Sunday. Our dorm is located in a really good spot. We are right between the Stadium and PROPNAME PROPNAME here at LOCNAME. It sure does make for a long walk to some of my classes though. Oh well, time's up.       
__label__label1 A of the present I guess the most common feelings I have are nervousness, excitement, sad, and happy. I imagine that these emotions are all quite normal, especially for a first year student. I guess the first two I will talk about are the "better" of the bunch: happy and excitement. The main reason I am feel these would have to be that for the first time in my life I have "true" responsibilty, there is not a parent or teacher looking over my shoulder to make sure I finish all my work and get it in on time, it is up to me. Secondly, I am lookinf forward to the learning style of college. No longer will I be bambarded with quesitons asking about pointless dates and useless facts, I will be asked to explain the theories and ideas taught in class. The lack of this is what I disliked about grade-school. I guess, at least in my case, for eahc "good" feeling there is an oppisite, "not-so-good" emotion. Most of the people I have talked to that went off to college were the most nervous about the simple fact of being away from home, "being on your own. "  I have friends as close as 00 minutes from home feeling the same thingas those 0000 miles away. But, at least as far as I can tell, I am not that home sick. THe part about being away from home is the fact that most of my friends are going to school at home. Granted I have a few friends going off to colleges that aren't at home or isn't LOCNAME, but the most part if my friends are not in LOCNAME LOCNAME (home), then they are up here at LOCNAME, in fact my roommate has been a friend of mine since 0th grade. Even on top of the "friends" factor, the one that gets me the most is that my girlfriend is still at home. That would have to be the hardest part about coming to LOCNAME and the reason for the most nervousness and most about of sadness. Lucky for us though LOCNAME LOCNAME is not that far, coparatively speaking, so the amount of time we can spend together is greater than that of my friends who went to other states and have a boyfriend or girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Although I am in the Longhorn Band, so that, at least for the fall, is eating up most of my time, but the time we do have together we enjoy a great deal, and both of our families support us so that helps considerably. So I guess all-in-all there are a lot of good emotions and feeling in me involving the change to "college-life", but nontheless there are still those "not-so-good" ones residing in me. 
__label__label1 I really don't have many thoughts right now, other than the fact that I get to go home this weekend. I really can't wait, and what is this song going on behind me?  Anyway, like I was saying, I get to see PROPNAME, she's my girlfriend. I miss her so much, but that's okay. I think about her constantly. For example, when I am in classes, I think about her all the time. No offense Dr. P. , but I do!  Anyway, I love this song that's on right now. I really wish these people would quit Instant Messaging me!  I get so tired of hearing my little ding in the back going off telling me someone is there!  Oh well, I guess it's my fault for being so damn friendly. That's okay though. I miss my little sister. I can't wait to see her. She is the most prescious thing to me right now, other than my studies. Who the heck is blaring their music. I am trying to do my work and they think everyone has to hear their damn music. That's okay though. I understand, I like music. Man, there isn't much room on this little space to write for twenty minutes. You should really reconsider and make us write for like ten minutes instead of twenty. That's okay though. I don't mind. It's not like I'm whining or something. Anyway, where is PROPNAME?  He never has this late of a day. Hmm, I wonder. Wow, PROPNAME PROPNAME is so pretty. Just too bad everyone has to dog her because she's successful and they aren't. I hate it when people do that. Oh well, I guess it's what makes the world go round. I don't know, I don't have all of the answers. I guess really no one does. I wonder why PROPNAME decided to talk to me of all people?  That was really weird. She's pretty though. I wouldn't mind getting to know her as a friend. She's really sweet, or so it seems. I love meeting new people. I guess that is why I chose this school, well at least one of my many reasons. I love college. So far, that is. I can't wait to meet more people. Wow, my twenty minutes is almost up. I can't believe it. I really can't wait to go home. I'm not homsick, but I am really wanting to see PROPNAME. See, there I go again, thinking about her. I can't stop thinking about her. I love her with all of my heart. I would never do anything to hurt her. I know that she knows that and I know that she wouldn't hurt me either. Man, these chairs hurt. I wish I had a cushion for it. That's okay though. I am thristy now. I need some lemonade. I guess I'll have to make some. I'm out. 
__label__label0 Okay RIght now I'm so worried about many things. I  just don't know what I want out of my life I am just so confused. I know what I want to be but I'm just so worried about making the grades that all I can think about a lot is school. Which I guess is good because they say if you worry enough about it that you'll end up doing good. It's just so tough for me not to worry about everything because I'm know on my own and I have to prove to everyone that I can make it and I can be independent. All throughout my life I've strived for the moment when I can be on my own and not have my parents or anyone else holding anything over my head. Well if schools not enough to worry about I have all of this other stuff like my relationship's with my friends and guys in particular. For instance I came here to LOCNAME with a boyfriend and not within two weeks I wanted to have an open relationship. When he came down to visit I was a complete bitch to him because I felt like I would have been missing out if I devoted all of my time to him. Anyways I know have found this totally awesome guy but the only problem is he is 00 years old and well I'm 00 and I think it's okay but I don't know exactly how he feels about it. I don't think he thinks to badley of it because he took me out on a date and he's invited me out again. But I can't help but think it is because I'm young and he thinks he can have his way with me. And I know he is really nice and such a great guy but I'm just so suspiciuos of all the guys up here because were in a big college town and a lot of the guys can only think about getting one thing!  Then also my ex-boyfriend keeps calling me from LOCNAME because he's in the Marines and he still fantazsies that we are going to get back together when he gets out. And I can't help but be nice to him or anyone else for the main fact that down the road of life who knows who your going to need a favor from. 
__label__label1 strees is this what college is really about. I never thought it would be this stressful especially this early in the game reading, class, reading, andmore reading. I never read this much in highschool therewas never any need I always found a way to float by but now PROPNAME to there isno more timeto fake it this is for real this is the big leagues as my dad would say. Speakin of which I remeber the car ride here the thousands of adages and proverbs and basically bullcrap that decided was something that was entirely neccesary and vital for me to hear I suppose he hadthe right to afterall he is paying for this and if I SCREW up then he will be the onetopay for the mistake therefore PREESURE and extreme amout of it for what reason it makesmewonder if anything including a college degree is worth that much in thegrand scheme of thingsafter all cameron's dad never went to college he decided to persue his dreams and enjoy life and heseems tobedoingjust fine but that not the Oleniczak way theOleniczak way is to pressure ourselvesto death that is to say that we must always succeed and at all costs wether it means dedicating our lives to something we hate orpretending that we really enjoy those things which will make us successful or at least acceptable to therest of our family because afterall god knows that if PROPNAME PROPNAME's kids succeed furthur in life then we do then we are obviosly not worthy who am I kidding they arenotthat bad after all I kow they love ilove them and they may putsome pressure on me but I know that deep down they are probably in the right despite that I am right where I want to be on my own away from home and surrounded by girls sounds like utopia if you put it in that perspective I guess I would not haveit any other way this is what I want and this is what I am going to do    
__label__label1 I am sitting in front of my computer right now thinking about how I have so many things to do and I am not sure how to organize my time sufficiently. I cannot decide what my priorities are yet. Of course classes are the most important part of being at college, but there are various clubs and organizations that I am interested in from the description on flyers and posters. I don't know what these clubs are really like though. It is the people that makes an organization fun and you cannot tell what people are like from a flyer. I am really hungry right now. I hate that the dining hall is closed for dinner on Sundays, not that the food is really that good anyway. Wait this isn't Sunday, this is Monday. We just didn't have class because it is Labor Day. That will mix me up all week. I will be a day behind. It is hard to let your thoughts flow naturally when you are thinking about thinking. I am so glad that PROPNAME came up to visit me this weekend. It feels so good to laugh with someone that already knows you. You don't have to try or think, everything just flows so naturally. I know that it takes time to develop a friendship like this and I cannot expect to just make instant connnections like that in a new place, but I am not good with all that patience and effort. I can't wait until the pizza gets here. I don't feel bad about eating unhealthy food because I have to walk so much around campus. I don't think I've ever walked so much in my entire life. And the heat totally drains me by the end of the day. I am dead tired. I am really surprised by the comfort of the beds in my dorm room. At orientation I couldn't sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable but now the beds don't seem as bad. Except the window next to my bed shines light all night long. I am used to total darkness and total silence from home. The car noises and people at all hours makes it tough to fall asleep. I've also been having strange dreams lately. The first couple of weeks in a new place I always have really vivid dreams and I always remember them really clearly unlike usually. This happens everytime I am away from home. Wether it was when we moved to LOCNAME or just going to summer camp. I am looking at the picture of my dog sitting on my computer. I miss petting PROPNAME. The other day there was a towel laying on the floor of our dorm room and I had to do a double take because I thought it was PROPNAME laying there. She is too adorable. When I get my own place I am going to get a LOCNAME puppy. I don't think I could ever live totally by myself, without a pet or anything. I either need a roommate or an animal, something to acknowledge my existence with a tangible response. Now its been a little over twenty minutes and the pizza is here and it smells really good. 
__label__label0 Well, college is turning out to be quite an adventure, although I could have guessed that before I got here. I am enjoying meeting different kinds of people as well as being challenged in all of my classes. I could probably do with less reading assignments, but the majority of the text that I've been reading holds the same principal. Learn to question things and make a decision on your own, with ideas to support it. I like this concept, it allows several possibilities in every aspect of life. The idea that the classroom wants me to think critically is exciting. My first impression when I walked into a big lecture class was intimidating. I'm used to the small classrooms where I know the other students around me and I'm comfortable with them. I can also get bored with them as well, so the big classrooms allow me to meet different people every day, this is something I definately like. I like to think that there are a lot of other college freshman feeling the same feelings that I am feeling, that I'm not the only one that is scared and intimdated yet excited all at once. It makes me feel not so alone, in s ORGNAME as large as this one it becomes a necessity to not feel alone or isolated by your fears. Making new friends is difficult but I think that the majority of freshman on campus are open to forming new friendships with many different people. The entire aspect of not living with my parents and having them in the same house as me p=monitoring my decisions and actions is both liberating and terrifying. I feel as though I have a chance to completly be myself and decide if the person I have been for the past eighteen years is truly me, but at the same time, I wonder if I can meet my parents expectations of greatness. Will I be the type of person that they would be proud of, will I have the ideas and beliefs that are acceptable to them. My fear of not meeting their expectations is not completely overwhelming because they have always taught me to question things and I think that if I form my own beliefs that happen to differ from their beliefs, they will be accepting if and only if I have reached that conclusion through logic and reasoning and I can support my ideas with valid argumentation. It definately can become intimidating at times though. I think the main thing that scares me is having to support myself. I have lived with these people who have taken care of me for eighteen years, I haven't ever had to support myself. In a world that I've only been shown glimpses of, I will soon be expected to make my way through on my own. THis I think is the truly scary part of starting college. It shows us what the world is like in spoonfuls and hopefully, we are prepared enough to face it by the time that we leave college. I don't want to be naive and think too optimistically because it is hard to look at the world in optimism all the time. Yet I don't want to scare myself to death thinking negatively all the time either. COllege will be a good tester of my character and ability to survive without my parents holding safety nets for my constantly. Over all, I am excited and terrified all at once. 
__label__label1 why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and I to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 0 years, and all of a sudden I have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, I don't think so. I mean, it is a nice gesture, I guess. I would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, I hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. I eamn, I did come here to expand my horizons. I do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. So, I decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. Why? it isn't like I am enjoying this. I would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. I really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. But, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and I love that. Even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. She is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, I could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. It was almost as though I could read her mind. My foot itches. Tomroow, I am going to church for the first time in about 0 months. I don't know why I stopped going, maybe I got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. I am not really sure, but I am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because I definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. No, that is not the right word, I am not lonely, maybe just scared of what I am to become being spiritually dark. Why did that happen? I don't understand so many things, but I am trying. I have also been going with PROPNAME, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. I really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. I miss my mom. I hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. He is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. He isn't very attentive, but very creative. I miss my family, we were very close. Except for my dad, he is a jerk. I wonder sometimes if I will ever find it important to speak to him again. I don't really think so. He does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. He doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every BAD move, without noticing the good ones. I am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but I am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. Maybe it will come in time. I hope that I am not studying the wrong things for class. I often wonder how I am going to make the grades. I mean, I know I can, I am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. Especially coming to college for the first time. I never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. Once again, I am so glad to have PROPNAME here to keep me in my comfort zone. It is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but I am struggling with all of these new people. I have not found the time to REALLY get to know anyone that is new yet. It is like they are all aquaintences. I am sure that that will all change, once I am in the swing of things and I do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. Why are we doing this assignment? Am I part of some sort of research? I would like to know, I feel like I am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. Maybe I am just another research rat. Why do they always do research on rats? I don't get it? If you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? I mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. But I do not like that animal research idea at all. Give it up. We are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. We should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. Why should we impose onto other species? What if it was the other way around? Wouldn't we think. "Why do they even care? It isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?" People are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. It almost ruins the whole experience of life on LOCNAME. or mars for that matter. Do we care if there is life on LOCNAME? Unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? Technology is killing man, man is killing himself. Life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y0k crap. Oh well, I don't understand. Why am I thinking all of this at one time? Pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as I am typing, but I suppose I am thinking it for a reason. I got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. Why? I asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. I mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. I think I deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, I am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. I miss the punk rock scene in houston. I am sure I just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. I found a club that I am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. I am extremely excited about that. I wonder if I am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. I wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. Then, all of the thoughts will explode and I will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? I definately think so. Well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. I want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. I can type extremely fast for some weird reason. I am done. enjoy me *cara* 
__label__label1 stream of consciousness, I don't even know how to spell the word, god my roommate is so retarded. she is so fat. if I get fat because of all the junk food ill be real angry. god I can't type. this is so retarded. I really like the song. damn I have to go to the bath room and its only been like 0 minutes porbaqbly less, there I dammit go again, can't type. uggghhh the stupid computer guy didnt call back about my computer, stupid flirt  oh yeah he can flirt and try and act all cool with me and my roommate but can't even get my computer back before my assignment is due. I hate using other peoples computers it just doenst feel the same and I really don't like typing on lap tops. I like my computer, it feel comfortable, I feel so weird at my own personal computer in college doing college stuff. although I am reall glad I don't have to write any papers. I'm pretty damn good at writting but I hate the effort that you have to put into it. my papers have to be perfect, each word percisely chosen, but then that is the point of most papers I mean all the really good writters specifically choose they're words to convey a point. I really have to go to the bathroom, but my god damn roommate has a guy over and the bathroom is right next to her room, I mean how akward is that. I have a problem going when its just girls. I have a dg meeting no a retreat at five 00 can't wait I really am beginnig to like being a dg although I don't know where ill get the money to pay for this but I worry about that later, I always get around things that I want, although I didnt get into the sor that I wanted I mean out of 0 I didn't get either, I just didnt realize how incredibly hard is is to get into the good ones, I just wish I knew why I was rejected at some of them. and I am really really bothered by the fact that this is so final I mean for life, I can't go back and try to fix things or change things. that's what's really bothering me, I can't seem to be in charge. I really wanted to be on crew really bad, I looks so fun and I love water, but the practices are so early I mean 0 and 0 in the morning, that's like the middle of the night for me. I got home at 0 and would have only got 0 hours of sleep if I wanted to go to try outs, and since I can't go to the practice tomarrow I am pretty sure thqat I can't do it, there's always next year, I guess its all for the best, I mean I will have a chance to get my footing and get adjusted, I don't want to be to heavily involved my first semester and being in a sorority takes up so much of my time. god I just really want to meet some hot guy and make really close friends, I know I'm supposed to give it time but I have been so severly disappointed since I have been here. I didnt get the chance I wanted to be in the in the really cool top sors and live-- had to go to the bathroom much better. I guess I'm happy I mean I just have such high expectations for myself, ilways want to appear to very cool to everyone else, I guess other's opinions really do matter and I know that isn't what is going to make me happy yes like with jas. jazz I really fucked up that one, all I could think was will I be cooll with this guy next year, not if I was happy or if I liked him as a person and when I realized what he meant to me it was too late. and then there's also the fact that after we got in that little fight I cuouldnt do anything about it. just wait for him to call or not call, I couldnt fix it. even after I went down there I wanted to make him see I was sorry and that I could be and was everything he wanted. I can get so messed up sometimes. I don't give people a chance because I don't perceive them as what other's would perceive as cool soes that make sense well to me it does. why am I so obsessed with society standards, I guess that 's I why I have never really be that happy or had a really super good best friend. to worried about what other people will think or say when they see me. I want to be proud like all the other girls and I don't see why they get to have everything. I mean they can be cold hearted bitches an dback stabbers, everything bad, but they'll have popularity, hot guys tons of people dying to be their friends, but me typically very nive and loyal doesn't ever get any of that, or maybe I do but just not they way I want. I always want what other people have or I can't get. more writting but I kkinda ran out of topics running why do I have to run so much and eat so little I'm mean I have a serious problem with wieght gain, I can't loose the pounds and I seriously feel like cruying because my legs are so thick. I mean I work out and I'm trying to more and have seriously cut back on my this song sucks how much longer, I guess its ok I don't want to take off my ursuline ring its part of who I am, I think its cute that I still wear it. i had a good time at ursuline it was only this summer that I got dicked over. I don't know what the deal is with andrea but the has some serious issues, she needs to grow up or get a life. I mean she just takes me for granted so much and now she's doing it to my roommate and I don't like it, I thought for once I would be able to get heroutof my life but it doesn't look that way, its like she doenst respect my friendship at all, she really doenst respect anyone, she is a conceited spoiled brat. I need to brush my teeth oh hey look I'm done  
__label__label0 well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 0, even though we came home around 000, and I had to get up at 00 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it 
__label__label0 right now it is 0:00 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over. 
__label__label1 Sometimes I think of what other people are thinking. I watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. They must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. I don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. I feel strange in the fact that I am putting my thoughts into words. Though I am concentrating on writing, I am also able to let my mind wander while I write. The way I think and the way I process my thoughts has changed since I've been in college. Leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which I desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that I have at home. My life in LOCNAME is good, but it is missing all those people that I made such a major part of my life. I wonder if those people will ever be there again. My family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. My friends and my boyfriend are the ones that I spent ever spare moment with. Now that I am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. I always travel back in time, in my head, to the days I spent with them. Every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times I had with them. Maybe they are thinking the same way. I can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. Those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. My mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but I have yet to see what she is talking about. My mother is great. Now I realize all the things she has done for me. She was always there for me, and even now that I am hundreds of miles away, she still there. I was distracted by the distant voices behind me. They seem to be discussing a project. Some kind of stress has been put on this group. I am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. Stress is one thing that I cannot deal with. When I stress I start to think a lot. When I think, I get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that I no longer can do the things I used to do in the past. Some people beside me are also using the computer. Their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that I am writing about them. If I were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. I can always feel someone looking at me. Even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes I can see someone look. Even when I don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. After this writing assignment is finished, I have to drive through LOCNAME's traffic to get home. That is the only thing I can't stand about going home. What should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. Things like that frustrate me. The light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. I have a feeling that LOCNAME is going to be just like LOCNAME, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. It is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. Pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. After that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again. 
__label__label1 Ok, 00 minutes. To start off, I should probably write a little longer than 00 minutes. If I only write for 00 minutes, you're not going to get very much. That's because my typing skills are way below even pitiful, much less below average. The reason for that is that I'm twice as old as most of the rest of the students in this class, and consequently did not grow up using a computer as they did. As a matter of fact, there weren't any computers at all in my high school. The only computers that the entire school district had were the ones that counted holes in punch cards. I took all my first standardized tests by punching holes in cards. Those were probably the only computers in the entire city. Wait, that's not true; some of the most advanced computers in the entire world were probably there. I grew up in LOCNAME, which is where the ORGNAME plant is located. ORGNAME(although they'll never admit it, it's common knowledge) is the final assembly point for all the nuclear weapons for the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Just a wild guess, but they probably had some pretty cool computers out there. What else? oh, I hope I can just write this here and hit submit, because being technostupid, I don't have a clue as to how to do any of that cutandpaste black magic. As a precautionary measure, I'm going to print it up. If it doesn't go through, I'll have to paper your office with printed copies and bother you with emails. OK, how long has it been? 00 minutes. My guess is that after 00 minutes, most of those folks will have come up with with 00 times what I have here. I hear them over in the computer center at the UGL with their flying fingers. Damned showoffs. But enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Never mind. Bad joke The next thing that pops up sort of relates to that first stuff. What in the hell is an old fart like me doing in a university in the first place? Well, I really, really screwed it up the first time. I couldn't be bothered to go to class back then; I had dope to deal. Well, it was the early 00s, there was a lot of that going on. So when I got fed up and pissed off in the job I had, I decided to look for a new job. Being tired of the whole restaurant business, I looked through the entire classified section, only to find that everyone wanted you to have a degree. It didn't have to have anything to do with what they did, they just wanted you to have one. The ad that tore it for me was for some retail place in the mall, I can't even remember which one, listed only 0 qualifications: a college degree, and the ability to lift 00 pounds. @#%$&&^%! So here I am. Now it's 00 minutes. See what I mean? I just did a quick division since that last timecheck and using the number of lines, it comes to about 0000 words a minute. I'm surprised the keyboard's not smoking. I'll go on for a couple of minutes more here. You probably haven't had nearly enough boring stuff to read today. Now I'm stretching to find things to say. Was that the point of this deal? To prove that more than 00 minutes of sustained thought was too much to sustain? If so I've more than proved the point here. Even 00(well, getting close to 00 now) has proved to be a stretch. Enough. I'm sending this thing. I hope you get it. 
__label__label1 Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like ORGNAME so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in LOCNAME for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to LOCNAME, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase "Is it hot enough for ya?" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 0 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 00's up! Hope it was good reading!  
__label__label0 I am not only extremely exhausted but I am beyond frustrated. I wrote this once before and my computer crashed it is no longer working and I was bout to pick it up and throw it out the window. This means that I really need a laptop or any new computer. I really want a laptop. Actually I would be content with a computer that will not shut down, freeze up and otherwise suck every 00 minutes. I am happy to be at ut this year. I am glad that I get to be near my girlfriend, we lived 0 hours apart last year, and its nice to see her everyday. I am on her computer right now, and it's too early to be doing this. I can't function. The past 0 days I was working my ass off to get this paper written for my freshman seminar and I got like 0 hours of sleep in those 0 days. That would have been fine if I got 0 each day, but I got one hour the first night, and five the next. Five isn't enough to overcome 0, and then last night after my extreme frustration with my computer not cooperating I went to sleep around 0:00 and then woke up at 0. That's still not enough. I need to get like 00 hours of sleep tonight; I would feel so much better. Well I am getting really bored doing this but I am keeping to the instructions, which for some unknown reason, were repeated over 00 times on the website. I mean I get the idea, I write what I think. You do not need to tell it to me, changing the order of the subject/object 00 times. Believe it or not saying the same thing, using the same words, but in a different order is not the same thing as explaining squat. I'm no expert, nor am I writer really. Actually my writing stinks. But I guess I expected more. College is a lot different from high school, but it certainly has its similarities. For example, my professor in my calc class is a really nice guy, but speaks very little English and has a heavy accent. Kids try and run over him, and it pisses me off. There enough problems with understanding him without him having to deal with people who refuse to listen to him. He knows his math and all. But still Anyway I am bored doing assignment, especially because I have don't it once before. OK I'm about to pass out. Someone needs to wake me up or something. Why can't I stay awake? Oh well im. I am a very slow typist. I wish I could type faster. But I am now finished with the minimum of 00 minutes and I will proceed to turn this in. I guess I'm allowed to stop writing what I'm thinking but I can't do it. Bye. 
__label__label0 My mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking ORGNAME my roommate's mouse on her computer. It just keeps going and going and going. Then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. I have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. I hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. He died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. Now I'm thinking about lunch. which I was supposed to have an hour ago. Yet, it is very upsetting because I have no food in the dorm in which I want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. I'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit LOCNAME from LOCNAME this Friday. He'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. That will be quite exciting considering that I haven't had any great food in a long time. I'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where I moved from. This weekend I'll be going to see my parents. When I think of my parents, I get a guilty feeling because I know I haven't been very truthful to them. But, there are just things that I can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. It makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, I don't really miss them yet because I feel restricted in their presence. The sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. Maybe because I just took a shower. My body feels warm and clean. I love that feeling. The sound of food is calling. but I need to type for another 00 minutes. For some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. The thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that I have an extreme hatred for insects. The thought of them makes me itch. Now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. Writing continuously makes me tired. Speaking of sleepiness, I think of the experiment we did on Monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. I was one of the control group people who just sat there. Sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. I fell asleep soon after that. Then I woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that I left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because I had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. It wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that I drooled all over myself. Not a good image. Speaking of image, I went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. It felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. Usually I am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and "mingle," but yesterday I needed to because it was a "rush" event. I am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something I really want to do because I'm not the extremely social type. However, as for now, I will keep on rushing to see how things go. It makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because I know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. It already makes him nervous enough to know that I'm up here at the populated ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. So, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. But like everyone's advice to me: Don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. Maybe this is why they gave me the advice. Because every time I go to some party or meet new people, I feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. I suppose I get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. Now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. However, I am still determined to make this relationship work. Now I am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. One more minute to go. I see PROPNAME on my computer screen. He makes me want to do well in school. I hope I will do well this year. I feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but I suppose I'll learn to handle it.

__label__label1 I really want to sleep right now. I am so overwhelmed with everything that I just want to sleep. I just need a little bit more rest but a little bit more time. Time, there just ever isn't enough time. Not enough time to read, to sleep, or to study. Time flies. Time is precious. I think that people spend too much time wasting time. I didn't realize that until lately. You think that everyone will always just be there but they aren't. Time is so valuable. The time you spend with people is so precious and important. And I think that sometimes it takes losing some one through a death or some one moving away for you to realize that. I didn't. I would give anything right this second to talk to my grandma. Anything. Or to be able to have my best friend who is that the ORGNAME ORGNAME just give me a hug. But no I wasted a lot of time. But busy busy busy bee. Maybe if I wasn't so busy and didn't get so involved I would have time. But it is so hard to say no. It is hard to not get involved. Especially in college. Everybody needs you! They all want you to join their organization! There are just too many and not enough time! But you know I guess if you didn't do anything and then you would have excess time you would complain about being bored and wish that you had more stuff to do during that time. So is there ever a happy medium. I thought that when I got to college I would have more time. I didn't have to be in class all day and I don't have as much going on but I was wrong. Time is still the same here. So now when I am out of school I will have more time? Right? Why do I have the feeling that once again I will be let down and time will still be as short then? I will have more stuff to keep me busy. A job and maybe a family and then they will take up a huge amount of my time. I just need a break. I need a cruise. A trip to the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Now that would never be a waste of time. That would be a great way to spend my time. I could just lie there and enjoy the scenery and just take it all in. Or got to LOCNAME I have always wanted to go to all the different islands there. I think that would just be a blast! There are lots of things that I have always wanted to do. I have always wanted to take belly dancing lessons, be in the Olympics, be able to sing like the women in the theaters, speak several other languages, sky dive, and much more. I wonder if anyone ever gets to do all the stuff that the have "always wanted to do" I wonder if there is enough time in a lifetime to do all of that?? I think that if you really wanted it you could. But I think that if you really want anything that you could. I don't like when people say they can't. I think that is just not a good word. Maybe I am just stubborn and always like I think I can I think I can! But isn't it much better going through life being like I think I can then I can't. How would that be a way to live life? What kind of fun would you have? Always thinking that it couldn't be done. I think that being optimistic is a much better way to live. That is so happy! I love it. I would much rather look on the bright side of life then be like this sucks, I hate this, I am miserable, I hate this, everyone feel sorry for me, and just be PROPNAME. That just doesn't sound like a good way to live life in my opinion. But I guess that I have just always seen the sun through the clouds. Just be happy and nice and care. That is all that I have ever wanted to do. I love to help. I think that is the greatest thing that you can ever do. Just care about someone. Does it hurt you? NO Does it take a lot of energy? NO So I guess that I just don't understand why more people don't care, and why some many people don't care. What is the point of that? You wouldn't want anyone to not care about you, so you should care for someone else. IT just makes sense to treat someone how you want to be treated. You know the Golden Rule. Well but anyways maybe people will change maybe it will just take time. Everything takes time though. But I have felt relaxed writing this. Maybe I should just write out what I am thinking more often. I kind of like this. I have no idea what I just typed but my mind is clearing. Maybe if my mind weren't so busy I would have more time?? That could be a good idea. I gave my self a great idea! Wahoo I am excited! But this does feel nice to just get all those thoughts out. I miss having my best friends to get those thoughts out to. Maybe just because my thoughts don't ever make sense to me but they could some how always just tell me what I was thinking. I mean not that they were like this is what you are thinking but more that they were like, well I can relate to that by this experience and that is when you are like YES! That is what I am talking about. That is a great feeling. When someone can help you figure out what you are thinking! Wonderful! We should do more of that helping people figure out what is on their mind. Maybe it just makes sense to them. Kind of like the whole thing how do I know that they color blue that I see is that same color blue that you see. I mean we know that we both see blue but do I see maybe your green or vise versa. Who knows? But that would be cool to know. Yeah that would. 
__label__label0 Steam and Consciousness. I am a new coming freshman; I like to be a LOCNAME student. To be in a gigantic school like UT, it is exciting but come with some fear. Fear that I might do badly on my school works or could not fit into the environment. After a week past, my point of view began to shift. Now I am comfortable with hundred of students walking on the street and the long waiting line in cafeteria. Sometime, in the back of my mind I could still remember the good times I had with my family. To me, family is the most important thing I can ever have. Through their supports and love now I can understand how important is for me to do well in college and have a descent future. Now, I am in my dorm room thinking about them, and thinking about how much I miss them. When I was little I always wanted to be an adult and take care things on my own. Family at the time never came in my mind, and moreover I sometimes childishly ignore them for video games or other sports. I really regret for what I had missed, a wonderful loving family. Beside to new environment that full with experiences the thing that come to me often is my family back in LOCNAME. I wish they could someday see my success and share my proud ness in the field that I love to do or work. 
__label__label1 I am writing an assignment for psychology. Stream of consciousness. What am I thinking right now? What am I thinking for the next twenty minutes? PROPNAME is watching the television. Wresting. ORGNAME. Idiots in spandex. T. V. is slowly killing us off. The announcer's scream. Loud, emotional, fake. Why do people watch it? Reality is more fun when it's fake. Big brother. Survivor. The real world. I hate the real world. True strangers, picked to live in a house, and devour each other alive. Devour. I want some ice cream, but I'm not hungry. They had Mexican food for supper tonight. There was a band playing. A Mexican band. I didn't like it. Music. ORGNAME's new cd comes out October 0. Hell yeah! Kid A is the name of it. If I could be in any band it would be ORGNAME. The television is distracting me. Wrestlers coming to the ring from the future. Futuristic wrestlers, live on television. And some people still believe it. PROPNAME just changed the channel. ORGNAME now. PROPNAME PROPNAME, and his Total Request Live. I'm ashamed of my generation. I feel sorry for PROPNAME PROPNAME, N'Sync, and all the other pop groups that greedy business men package to be sold. In five years where will they be? The kids who love them now will laugh at them, and call them queers, has beens. Telephone is ringing. PROPNAME answered it. It's for him. He rarely gets a phone call. I get all the calls. The end of my twenty minutes is coming up. Fifteen seconds, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
__label__label0 I'm sitting all stressed out. For the first time since if got to UT I've had to study and do homework for a large period of time. I guess for the first time since I've gotten here I'm starting to realize how much work its going to take. The fraternity stage is getting old. They don't tell you that you are going to be busy about everyday of the week doing sometimes pointless stuff. I'm new to the fraternity scene and already I'm feeling somewhat burned out. And paying a lot of money to clean the frat bathrooms isn't my idea of fun anyway. Even drinking is getting old. Its almost to the point that you can expect to get messed up every night and that takes the fun out of the whole thing. I don't like admitting this to myself but it would be nice to see someone from the family right now. I'm not homesick just kind of feel like I'm missing out on everything that's going on in my brothers and parents life. It's hard to deal with the fact that the family life is never going to be the same again which is somewhat of a relief but also a little scary. At least I am enjoying living with my roommates. They were my friends before I came here but I am a bit surprised to how good we are getting along. With my friend dying last week I found myself today thinking I saw him in other people. The reality of death has hardly set in on me. His picture of him alive is hanging right in front of me, but its hard to comprehend there is no more life in him. I almost feel like all my experiences with him were pointless because he is dead. Even seeing him in an open casket I failed to connect him laying there to his death. I attribute this to the fact that this is the first person in my life that I was close to that has died. It's weird but it will help me in the future to deal with the harshness of death. More than ever I think along the lines of life after death. I'm firm in my beliefs regarding the subject but I somewhat question what its really like. I guess you never take death seriously until it effects you on the personal level. I hear of people dying everyday but it has never registered to me how important everyone's life his to someone else out there. And above all I guess the possibility of death seems more likely. I feel less likely to put myself in situations where my life is on the line. 
__label__label0 I am supposed to write for twenty minutes while I track my thoughts. I am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. It is 0:00, and unfortunately I have to miss my calculus discussion class at 0:00 due to a chemistry review for a test I have on Thursday, the 00th. PROPNAME, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group ORGNAME, is actually playing on my computer while I write this. I am also ripping one ORGNAME my compact discs via my computer so I can listen to it while not actually having the CD in the ROM drive. Sometimes I like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. It is absolutely incredible. In junior high school, I had no idea what the Internet was, nevertheless how to use it. Now, I sit at my computer and I will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. How does the information get to the desired location? I suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 0s using the binary number system. Still, the entire concept is simply amazing. What is in store for technology in the future? Hover cars? Now there is a concept. I come from LOCNAME, which is not only the most polluted city in the LOCNAME LOCNAME but also has a mighty big traffic problem. I think I will switch my music to PROPNAME. There we go. Anyway, with the help of cars that "float" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. However, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. Now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. This would definitely cause some major problems. Maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. The song has now switched to PROPNAME's LOCNAME. My friend PROPNAME has the score to this piece at his dorm at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because he is a music major. A bunch of my friends and I are going to see the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert in LOCNAME in a couple of days. I have seen the ORGNAME perform two previous times at the LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they were incredible. However, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. They will be coming out with a new album very soon, so I assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. Well, twenty minutes has just expired, so I will sign off now. 
__label__label0 Okay, I'm not quite sure what to write. I'm sitting in the undergraduate library right now because I can't get my computer at home to get internet access. It is a pain to have to have to come all the way down here to use the computer, but on the other hand it's good because while I'm here I'm going to study some other class materials. Maybe coming to the library will motivate me to keep up with my studies. It's ten minutes until 0pm on Sunday and I can't wait to go to bed! I just got done working out and I am already a little sore. I had a good day today, I did a little shopping this afternoon, and then I got to see my parents. They were driving through LOCNAME on their way home, LOCNAME LOCNAME, from LOCNAME LOCNAME. We went to dinner and got to visit for a little while. I was happy to see them, but a little sad because the reason they went to LOCNAME LOCNAME was to see my grandmother, my mom's mom. She has breast cancer and isn't doing as well as we'd like. She's especially nervous today because she starts radiation all over again tomorrow. It's kind of tough to think about this because my mind starts to wander and start asking thousands of "what if" questions. What if she passes away? What is my grandfather going to do? How will my family survive? Luckily enough, my family is very close, so I know that everyone will find the support they need, but there is still no way to prepare yourself for these things. My mom says that she's more worried about how my two sisters and I are going to be when my grandfather on my dad's side passes. He's only 00 years old, but he has diabetes and doesn't take care of himself like he should. My body is weak right now, mainly from working out, but I can't help but notice that I feel like my body is "sunken" since I started talking about death. You'd think that I would talk about something cheerful, especially since I am a pretty cheerful person. I guess I just need to talk about my fears for a while. Well, the rest of my life is going well. I transferred here from ORGNAME ORGNAME and I am adjusting to ORGNAME and LOCNAME pretty well. I definitely miss my friends from Tech, but I can always visit them. I'm in an incredible relationship with my best friend. PROPNAME and I have been together for close to two years now. It's an amazing thing to find true love. It's kind of scary to think that this is probably going to be the guy I spend the rest of my life with, but without a doubt I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with him. I feel like just yesterday I was starting high school, and here I am in my second year of college. God has given me some incredible attributes. I think I look up to my parents a great deal. They have been married for over twentyfive years and are going strong. It's an amazing thing to grow up in such a loving and supportive household. I think the most amazing part, is that the love and support does not end with my immediate family, it travels throughout my entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins. If you can't tell already, family is definitely number one in my book, and it will continue to be that way. Well, I have rambled on and on for the past twenty minutes so it is time to go study and read. 
__label__label1 why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of "natural" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a "serious" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. 
__label__label0 For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 0 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, "I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, "Why are you here at LOCNAME?" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, "I don't know" or "That's a good question. " So with that said, I ask myself, "Why am I here?" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? PROPNAME PROPNAME is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 00 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being "brainwashed" in college. So what exactly does "brainwashed" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, "When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. " NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to "use" my degree when I "get a job. " I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. 
__label__label1 Wow, that psychology chapter is really long. I am so mad at myself for letting myself get so far behind already. Hello, it's only my third week of school and I am already more behind than I ever want to be. I wonder if typing on my computer bothers PROPNAME as much as it bothers me when she does it. Do I have enough selfdiscipline to make myself catch up on all this stuff or am I just going to keep procrastinating until I absolutely have to get it done, like the night before a test. I really hope I can make myself catch up because then I can go out and have fun and not have to worry about what I have to do when I get home. I don't know why I let that bother me so much. Last night, I wasn't really having any fun at all and they all said it was the funnest party of the year. I wonder if it's because I didn't get completely wasted or if it's because I don't like their idea of fun, or if I was just in a bad mood. And why would they think there's something going on between me and PROPNAME. EWW! I mean he's nice, but come on. I thought this wasn't going to be like high school. Shouldn't I be able to be friends with a guy without everyone thinking there's something going on between us? Eww! Oh, well. I hope I have more fun with them soon. I would hate to have just joined this organization that they all seen to be totally into and me just not like it at all. I want to be able to gush about how much I love it to all of my friends and family back home and the ones here. What if it turns out I hate Longhorn Singers? That would really be a shame. What if I can't find any organizations I can really get into here? Like the whole dance thing. I looked at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and they looked like a drill team trying to dance with really bad choreography. And the Roustabouts just seems a little too provocative for me even though I think jazz is so fun. Why does it have to be all about sex (as PROPNAME says) I really want to take some kind of jazz class because I need to expand my horizons so I can move to LOCNAME LOCNAME or LOCNAME LOCNAME and be a dancer on LOCNAME or a backup dancer for some music artist or in someone's music video. Would it be great if I could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that I could live comfortably? If that was guaranteed, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wonder if this is what I'm really passionate about. All the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do. I mean I have so much fun when I dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me. It would just be fun a job of pure fun. But, come on, who really gets to do what they really want to do. Who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man? People do what they do to make money and I think that's so sad, but I'm one of those people, too. Money is important to me. It doesn't rule my life but it is definitely a factor. I don't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what I deserve or what I've earned for it. And our society is just completely out of whack. Why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws? Why are teachers so underpaid? They should be some of the highest paid people in the world, I think. Because of them, we are able to learn. We would be nowhere without our teachers. That's such a shame. It pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality. Just look at LOCNAME. What a mixed up place that is, yet it looks like so much fin to me. I would love to be famous. To have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them. That would be a blast. All you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines. Go to awards shows, and travel. I want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages. But I don't want to learn them part way. I want to be fluent in the way that I don't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think I'm stupid like we do when someone can't speak our language correctly. I wonder what that would be like to change cultures. No one would know anything about you or your past. Like PROPNAME. You could be a total loser/reject in our society and be a heartthrob/most popular kid in school in another country. And you're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you. 
__label__label1 I had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time I wanted to do it or remembered to do it, my boyfriend PROPNAME was in the room. I didn't feel like I could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if I knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second. I guess I knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time; stuff that I didn't want him to know about. He would kill me. Not in the literal sense of course but in any case, he would be destroyed. If I told him what I was thinking it would be the end. I don't want it to be the end. I'm not saying I don't want it to (I've got mail, and I really want to check it, but I'm going to keep typing) go on forever, but I love him enormously and if I told him that while he was gone for an evening I slept in another guy's bed and we ended up fooling around. that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with PROPNAME. I've always been big on honesty, but why can't I bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between PROPNAME and I? Maybe because he'd ask why and I'd say that I'm not even really sure why. That's a big problem with our conversations. If he asks me why or what's wrong (he says "what?" a LOT) I can't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then I usually can't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if I attempt to describe it, then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he'll bring it up later because he's like an elephant. he never forgets. So I'm still trying to figure out why? Maybe I needed something exciting. I've known PROPNAME for years and we've been dating for over 0 months. I was never really physically attracted to him, but only later I was because I loved him. The first time I met PROPNAME I almost stopped in my tracks. I don't know why. maybe it was because the first time I saw him was when I walked into a friend of a friend's apartment (he's my friend's friend's roommate) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop. After that night I couldn't stop thinking about him and I heard (dang it, why didn't I put an away message for my instant messenger. That friend of mine that I was just talking about IMed me but I told her I had 00 minutes left so I'll talk to her later. probably about this assignment and because we've been discussing this PROPNAME issue) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too. The next time I went over there I didn't really talk to him much. but the third time I was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there. After that we started emailing each (okay taking the towel off of my head. or maybe not, my hair's not quite dry yet. I'll just unwrap it) other. Then the night two weeks ago that PROPNAME went to a concert, I went to PROPNAME's apartment with my friend and we all hung out. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't intend on staying over but I developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night I was so sick that I couldn't move, much less drive. The guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so I wouldn't have to drive home and the rest is history. I felt so guilty lying in bed with him though. He had asked me if he could get in bed with me and I said yes. I said yes. I didn't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back. I didn't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but I didn't pull away either. I was very still when he kissed my forehead, but I didn't tell him to stop there. Why didn't I? Because I wanted it. But I have a loyal, devoted, loving, honest, wonderful boyfriend already. Why did I want this, or think I needed it? It was thrilling. Even though PROPNAME was a bad kisser. It was like kissing a large mouth bass. Eventually I gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined. It wasn't really sexual. For the most part. This is making me sound horrible. I probably am horrible. Yeah, I am. This was cheating. And by not telling him and by still communicating with PROPNAME via phone now and still email, I continue to be deceptive. PROPNAME doesn't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to LOCNAME at the end of the year. And I don't love him. I don't really know him. I've hardly been around him except for three or four times. We've had two meaningful conversations. The whole concept of a relationship with him is silly. Yet I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since I met him and wondering about him, etc, etc. I just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me (just got out of the shower before I started this). My palms are kind of damp, not good for a laptop probably. Okay, it's been more than 00 minutes so I'll stop now. I wonder why I wrote a confession of sorts. And I wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this. I'd better not save this, just in case PROPNAME finds it. I'm terrible. 
__label__label1 Boy Bands  They suck big time. I'm listening to the radio right now and one of the 00 is on. I do not see the huge interest in them. They all seem fake since LOCNAME Kids on the Block. They were the original hotties! I can't tell if it's my allergies or if I'm getting sick, but my nose has been running ever since this past weekend. I got to go see my niece and nephew this weekend. I really enjoyed that. For once I got to go out of town on Labor day. My parents always said next year, or later this year. I'm amazed we got out of LOCNAME this year. We were supposed to go to LOCNAME this summer, but that fell through. Then we were supposed to go to New LOCNAME, and that didn't feel right. Then we all finally decided on LOCNAME. My brother was going to bring his girlfriend and we were all going to have a great weekend break from the routine. That didn't work either. We ended up cutting that one to. Finally we decided that it was our turn to go to LOCNAME to see my nieces and nephews. It was fun, but they sure are weird. I have an older half brother, an older half sister, and an older halfhalf sister. We really aren't related, but we are still pretty close. We have a lot of fun together. I don't talk to my half sister anymore. She's a bit. Sorry. She's mean and selfish. She told me that I stole her dad from her. She has some serious problems. She has to be the center of attention, and she's always trying to be better than everyone else. If something good is happening between two people she has to stir things up. She's a complete brat. She's too used to getting everything her way. I hope my roommate can't see up my shorts. I don't know if this is something that happens with time, but I really don't like underwear anymore. I don't understand how some people can wear the granny kind of underwear. Sorry if I am offending you. But hey, this is my stream of consciousness. I'm really looking forward to this class. My mom had a lot of fun teaching it. I've always wanted to be like her in some way or another. I've always looked up to her. Somehow she is always right. There are the few occasions, but for the most part she's always right. Sometimes it makes me sick. I'm running out of things to talk about. Hmmm. I miss my friends from LOCNAME. I'm a freshman. So many of my friends went to different schools or are still in high school. I was the oldest in my group of friends. My parents keep telling me how some of the girls are looking up to me, and want to be like me when they get to college. I love to hear that kind of stuff. It really keeps me in check. Yeah! One of the songs I always sing with a girl I hung out with all summer is on. It's weird, but it seems like juniors and freshmen always hook up. I don't mean like going out, but also in just hanging out. It seems like there's always two years in between close friends. I have a friend who just turned 00 and she is so pumped. I feel really bad, because her mom and step dad are getting divorced right now. She just moved from her last home. I'm pissed at her step dad. He said that he wanted a divorce because he felt he wasn't providing enough for his child, which is crap!. He gave her everything she ever asked for, plus some. So now he has put my friend, her mom, and her brother out in the cold. He's a jerk. I'm not going to go any more into this subject. I'd get too heated. This time has really passed pretty fast. I'm surprised! I don't get why people drink alcohol. I just don't get it. I have plenty of fun sober. Sometimes more fun than my friends have, and they have hang overs the next day. It makes no sense to me. Being sober's the way for me! Well, this was fun. I'll chat with you later! 
__label__label0 Sitting here in front of my large window, I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room. Everything feels fresh and clean, except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed. I love warmth any form of it actually. Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold. Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough? My old special boyfriend used to tell me, "cold hands, warm heart. " That was something his mother used to say. I guess she had cold hands too. Right now, I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices. I am no way questioning my faith in God, but instead, how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing. For instance, ever since going through rush and pledging, I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to. Basically, my biggest concern is partying and or drinking. For me personally, I feel that alcohol is something that I really don't need to have fun. Then, why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway? After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy, I have done much better. Going to the parties, I merely say, "No thanks, I'm fine" when offered the drink. I am so blessed to have the friendship of PROPNAME. It's funny how close or connected you can feel to somebody when you've only known them for a couple of months. Some of my friendships that have lasted for years are not nearly as close as the companionship that I am experiencing with PROPNAME right now. The only problem is that I feel myself really starting to like him. Actually, in reality, deep down I have what they call a "crush" for him ever since we met at the ORGNAME camp that we worked at together. I'm not sure what he thinks he is so incredibly complimentary to me, so I have the suspicion that he may reciprocate some of my feelings. All of our discussions circle around God and Jesus. I have never known anybody so passionate for their believes. Overall, it makes me feel like I should be moving in a different direction, a higher one with my relationship with Christ. This takes me back to the partying scene  What I see there is not glorifying God or His name. Yet, if I can, in some way, glorify His name while I am there, then my actions will coincide with my believes, right? In a way, the only thing I can count on is prayer and patience. It makes me think of PROPNAME and his life in LOCNAME. By faith and trust in God, PROPNAME and his people passed through the Red Sea. I have faith in my Lord that He will provide me with direction and strength, like he promised to Moses in the Bible. This leads me to think about my education. Sometimes I wonder what my future will be like  What am I going to major in? How many years of college will I attend? Will I have a good job? Will I be married? Will I have children?  the questions are endless and sometimes it can even be entertaining to imagine how things will be. I've noticed that when I think about things like this, I always see the fairy tale side of the story. I see myself with a wonderful education, a highpaying and fun job, an incredible husband, and three cute and perfect kids. This fairytale imagination of mine can lead to bad things or to a lost in the grasp of reality. I remember going into high school coming from a small, private middle school and thinking that I would be playing varsity everything, would have tons of new friends, and I even thought that I would be dating a cuter, older guy. Well, this was not the case. Things happened very differently. I ended up, by the end of my high school career having all of these things, but in a different way. I had six very close girl friends (not tons), I had a special guy in my life (actually a month younger than myself), and I made varsity softball (after two years of working really hard). Yet, looking back, I am so incredibly pleased as to how my life has traveled so far. So, looking ahead, I really must understand that as much as I want to pave the way for myself, that sometimes things happen differently than planned. Yet, there is a reason and there is a plan. Even when negative things occur, there is some kind of positive outcome, whether it's realized the next day or ten years down the road. Bad things are going to happen  it's inevitable, but it's essential to try to look at things in a different light, a 
__label__label0 Okay, I am starting to write for this assignment. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write, but I guess it's sort of like a journal and I'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking. I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. It is so big here, and it's kind scary. I'm used to knowing everyone around, but here I don't know anyone. Friends is on right now. It's pretty funny. I miss being in LOCNAME where everything is normal. I'm not used to the times shows come on here. This sounds really stupid, like I am just rambling on about nothing. Friends is funny. Am I doing this right? I don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. I miss PROPNAME, the guy I am dating from LOCNAME. I don't really want anything serious with him, but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do. Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot, or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. I don't know I am not sure. And then there is my exboyfriend PROPNAME. I don't want to be with him, but sometimes I miss him. I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that. I also don't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. What if I totally regret it in the future, and I want him back, but he doesn't want me. That would be horrible. I don't know. I'm just pretty confused right now. I don't know what I want about anything. It's hard getting used to everything around here. I miss the show 00000. I was just thinking about it for some weird reason. That used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. I'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I don't know if I'm going to go or not. My roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. She's the same major as me. She's a pretty good influence on me. She gets me to go to meetings and stuff that I probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. I am filming the volley ball game on Saturday for a live broadcast. I'm glad I am getting involved somehow. I tried to get tickets to the OU game, but I couldn't they were already sold out when I was supposed to get them. I'm pretty bored right now. I probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since I'm free writing, I don't think it really matters. At least I hope it doesn't matter. I'm a little scared about grades. I hope tests and stuff are not too hard. I'm not really thinking about anything right now, so I have nothing to right except that I have nothing in my head. This is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. I'm glad it rained today, it was nice. I love the rain. Ever since I was a life guard I have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. Everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, I guess I'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. Okay, well my time is up. 
__label__label0 Right now, my dad just left and I am feeling homesick and sad. Even though by the time I left home I was so ready to leave, but now seeing him makes me feel really sad. It's not just that I feel sad but I feel guilty to. My dad is so awesome and when I lived at home I never really appreciated him. Sometimes I can be so incredibly selfish and self absorbed. I guess experiences like leaving home are good for us because they help open our eyes and let us see things that we wouldn't ordinarily. At home I was in my own little world which revolved around my school, friends, and family. Now being in LOCNAME with out any of these comforts, I feel much more vulnerable and also naive. Living on the drag can open your eyes more than anything. My dad told me that just yesterday the bank underneath my building got robbed. That kind of stuff freaks me out because I go to that bank constantly and I just never expect anything like that to happen. I really don't understand why people do things like robbing a bank. I guess it's just hard for me to understand how people could feel like they have no other options than to just rob a bank. Although it's probably naive of me to say this, there are so many organizations and programs out there for people which just go so unutilized. I really enjoy working a places like those. I am still consider pledging the APO frat. The only problem is that if I do it's still going to cost me money, even though it's not as much as normal frats. I'm really not sure I can afford that. I spend money so fast up here. I probably need to get a job, but I really don't want to. I think it would be so overwhelming if I was to get a job. It would be a fun way to meet people though. And my managers said that they would be more than willing to get me a job at any of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME's if I wanted one. I really miss all of my friends from my job. next time I go home I am going to go up there and visit everybody. I am going to visit all of my friends also. I miss them all so much. Last night I called PROPNAME. It was so good to talk to her again. She is honestly the only person who really understands me. She understands all of this crap that I am going through with PROPNAME. I can not believe that I have been here for 0 weeks and he hasn't called me once. I have no idea what the deal is with him, but if he doesn't want to se me any more then he needs to let me know. Well, time's up. 
__label__label0 College life is so much different than anything that I have ever experienced in my life. It is so neat how you come here knowing so few people, and by the third week you are best friends with a group of guys from some place you have never heard of. I would never have guessed that I would get a roommate that is engaged and is never here, or break up with my girlfriend, or even meet so many different people. What is so neat about it is that you meet somebody new every day. You meet those people, then you meet their friends, and then their friends, and before you know it you have this huge network of people that you thought you would never meet. The other thing about college that was different was the incredible urge within me to surround myself with people that I previously did not know. That is why I broke up with my girlfriend. I was being stubborn and was thinking to myself that there are so many women here and I will find somebody else. Sure there are plenty of other people here, but not one has been as cool as PROPNAME was. Now I can't decide if I want to get back with her or if I want to stick it out and find someone different. When thinking about this decision, the saying, "don't fix it if it ain't broke" always comes into my head. We were happy together and we had fun, so why should I not stay with her. Then again we did have our bad times and there are so many other people here at LOCNAME. I don't know what to do so I'll move to another topic. This semester I am taking 00 hours of course work. I have six different classes and everybody thought life was going to be so hard for me, but it really has not been to bad. You have so much time to get everything done in college. Where in high school I was playing 0 different sports and taking hard classes, now I am just taking those hard classes. It is nice to be able to do whatever I want when want. I am used to having my parents around nagging me about homework and studying, but they can only call and do that here. Just because I am not feeling to swamped with 00 hours doesn't mean that I want to continue taking that many hours from here on out though. After this semester I only have to take like 00 hours a semester, which will be even better. That is unless I decide to study abroad. By writing about exactly what I have been thinking about, I can now see what has been wearing on me since I have been here. I mean I knew what the basis was for all I was thinking about, but until now I hadn't really thought about how all this stuff has such an effect on me. I have always and always will worry about my schoolwork and about girl problems, so that doesn't really come as much of a surprise to me. However it does surprise me that taking 00 hours doesn't really bother as much as I was thinking it was. 
__label__label1 this assignment should be interesting but at the same time inhibited my slow typing. I do not like to use computers especially the internet. I had such problems on the internet when I was applying to ut that I almost did not get in because of them. but I am here now and happy. the one thing I am surprised about at ut is that there aren't more blacks or persons of color. I guess that is just the way things go. there are a lot of other ethnicities represented here though. my high school graduating class of 000 had 0 minorities in it. ut is a bit of a change. but for the better I am sure. my high school on LOCNAME was private and some would venture to say snobby. I agree but a lot of times it was nice being in a homogeneous world. it reminds me of our country club in LOCNAME. 0000 memberonly wasp. it is really not all that bad, though from a member's perspective. I like being one in a big heard of the same type of people. that is why I joined a fraternity up here at ut. it is fun and a good way to meet girls and guysmostly whom are white. I totally understand, value, and enjoy the perspectives of minorities though. last year in a history discussion class there was a Hispanic girl and she brought so many unique and amazing perspectives to the table although most of them had to do with religious based ideas. Speaking of religion I need to get some while I am up here in college. nobody has enough time for religions up here it seems but wouldn't that be so much better if they did. I find religion to be the best thing on the face of the earth although I do not get or have enough. the problem is it is difficult to do so and the results are not as immediate as a good grade on a test or anything else you work hard for. I miss my home church but I will probably end up going back there. I probably will end up moving back to LOCNAME when all of my schooling is done. just like my dad and his dad's dad. I am a 0th generation PROPNAME county resident and that makes me happy. I wonder how many times I have used the word 'I' in this writing. how many minutes have I written for only five to go. I might be a slow typist. never could type to well. not good hand eye coordination. my brother has good hI coordination. my wisdom teeth hurt and I need to get them removed or just take some more Advil. speaking of Advil and the thing that I thought I would be using them the most for, hangovers, I don't even drink half as much up here at school as I did back in high school. maybe that is a good thing. 0 more minutes. my hands are a bit sore. what to write or think about. today was a good day I hope that that girl I met at dinner tonight has an interest in me and not my friend PROPNAME. she said she liked PROPNAME. He has a girl friend though who is coming to town soon. I bet she is good looking 
__label__label0 Right now I have a serious feeling of relief. It is the night after my first day of college, and it feels nice to be home. My legs are tired. I miss my dog and my boyfriend. I wonder what he is doing right now. I hope I am doing this right. I guess there is no right or wrong when it comes to my thought process. I guess it just happens the way it wants to. I hope that I can get back into the whole school "flow" again. I hope that I can get into it enough that I can get into the business school. I can feel you laughing at me already. Everyone seems to think that I can't do it. I know I can. I will. My mind is blank. I am so worn out. I haven't walked so much in one day than I did this afternoon. I hope I am not sore tomorrow. I need to find out where I need to go in the morning. What time do I have to wake up? My class is at nine thirty. Great! Why hasn't my boyfriend called me? He was supposed to an hour ago. Wonderful! Oh, I have to call my mom. I wrote a check today that I have to tell her about. How much was that thing? That reminds me. I have to set up Telesys tomorrow. Just one more thing to add stress to my day. I should work on my typing. What is that noise? I need to take a shower. Maybe I will wait until morning. I should call all my friends back home to give them my new house number. I wonder how college life is going for them. LOCNAME started late this year. Thank God! I don't feel rested, still. What time is it? Five minutes to go. I feel like my mind is blank. Whenever I try to "hear" what I am thinking, the only thing I end up thinking about is trying to think. That made absolutely no sense. I'm hungry. I really need to be more open. I've gone all day without meeting anyone new. I need to work on that. Oh, time's up. 
__label__label0 hello, here I am trying to figure out what to write for this 'assignment'. Well, let's see, I believe I have a CS quiz in a couple of hours, I should get studying for that. Yeah, that what I'm thinking. I need some print outs for that though. Boy, I wish I could study at my job, this way I wouldn't have had to wake up early in order to study over the quiz material. Oh well, what can one do. My jobs pretty good by the way, its new and the stuff is either easy, or once where I learn. Hence, I have fun. I haven't chatted on MIRC for a long while. Maybe I'll do that at work, it should be fun. Hmmm, I'm just thinking like random thoughts, about nothing specific. My gyming is going fine, hope I get a good looking chest/body over the next month or so, not that I need to show it off or something, just because this way the clothes i wear will I guess look better on me. Anyway, so how much time is up, I think about 00'ish minutes, I need to drink something dude, maybe milk. But nothing is OPEN! well it is like 0am too. I guess people don't have quizzes that have to prepare for. I think I'm going to go to my job kind of early and print out some slides for the CS class quiz it should be easy. and about this whole Coop thing I think I should go check out the companies but not really apply apply I don't want to as yet I think I can make my GPA higher and then apply what do you say well I can't there's no one really who might be able to help me out I just have to think about myself. but CoOp fairs are a great time you get to get all dressed up at stuff but in this HEAT!? hmmmmmmmmm I don't think that would be a good idea. anyway I believe my 00 minutes should be over by now so I'm going to take off. 
__label__label0 I am sitting here wondering as to why I chose to do this assignment at this particular time. As I search my the thoughts the number one reason I can find is BOREDOM. I am so bored right now, as I have throughout my entire UT experience. I miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. I have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but I feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that I have become accustomed to over the past 00 years. I'm pretty sure that I just used a runon sentence. Five minutes down, fifteen to go. Notice that I spelled out the words "FIVE" and "FIFTEEN" in order to waste. I am wasting this time because I don't feel any need to be introspective. I feel that I know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, I that I have no need to further analyze my thoughts. I am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. I'm sure that my high school English teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences I started with "I". Although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word "saw". Did you notice that I also spelled out the word EIGHT. It has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. I hope that this writing is still here when I come back. I'm back. That took about a minute. Sorry. I meant to right ONE minute. I wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. I wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? I wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? I feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. I feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. As this assignment comes to an end I wonder what I was supposed to have learned, for I feel that I am none the wiser. TWENTY minutes have now passed. The END. 
__label__label1 I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of PROPNAME PROPNAME at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 000 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 0 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when PROPNAME makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. LOCNAME is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. 
__label__label0 okay. here's the thing. I'm not writing this on my word processor but I do want it to be a stream of consciousness so I'm not going to worry about punctuation, spelling, or capitalization. so here goes. I'm not even exactly sure what to write about but I'll just go with something. Ummm last night I went out and had a kind of interesting night I went over to my old friend carlo's house where he was having a party although me and my friend laura prefer to think of it as lar's house because carlo has been hating us for some while. actually not for some while, ever since he went to LOCNAME. so I went last night because I really wanted to tell him not to hate me anymore and we talked for awhile about what was wrong, basically he says he feels like he has tried so hard with me and I always put him on the bottom of my list and now I'm off in boyfriend land and don't even care to make time for him. which sucks because I seem to get that from a lot of people and I think that I really make excuses about it to myself because it seems to me that everyone has just assumed that boyfriend land whatever that is is where I want to be so they just kind of cut me off without even asking me what I really want or feel. so then I kind of go off to boyfriend land because I feel like he's the only one who ever wants to hang out with me anymore even though it sucks when he is the only one I am hanging out with anymore because too much time with any one person really sucks. it also sucks when I go to a party and people are always asking me, "where's your boyfriend?" like I'm not allowed to go out without my boyfriend or we are weird because we don't always want to go to parties together but I'm glad that eric wasn't there last night because I don't think that carlo would've talked to me about all the stuff that he did. also eric says that he doesn't even like going to parties with me anymore because I'm such a damn flirt. which I guess I am but I don't really think that I am whenever he's around. if that makes it any better. I wonder where jamie is right now. that is one of those things she probably told me so I probably should know. I feel like I'm writing in a diary right now and that is very weird for me since I haven't written in a diary since oh maybe middle school and even then it was just retarded writing saying things like oh my god! I danced with dj at a the dance! or more often someone in my group of friends is fighting because it seems that is all we ever did. I wonder if that was the group that I hung out with back then or if it was just our age and immaturity. oh well. anyway back to jamie. where is she? I don't know but I sure wish that I was working with her tonight the night goes by so much faster whenever she is there I swear. maybe it is because I'm antisocial I don't know. what sucks is that we got tickets to go see kenny chesney (the hottest country singer ever! as long as he keeps his hat on though he's kind of bald and if he wears his little black shirt because that is always a plus too) anyway we got tickets to see kenny chesney and now because of her stupid sorority that she doesn't even like or want to be in but has to stay in because she lives in the damn house she can't go. which pisses me off. I don't even want to go if she's not going annoying but I really do because it is after all kenny chesney I just don't really want to go with the people that we bought tickets with because I don't really know them even though we work with them. I don't really know oh well my time is up and I've got to go call laura anyway. you know I thought that I would be able to type a whole lot more than this in twenty minutes. oh well. 
__label__label1 I have so much reading to do. It seems in all of my classes the professors are overwhelming us with material. But I guess that is to be expected in college, or at least that's what they told us. But I will persevere. I did have above a 000 ORGNAME in high school. So this shouldn't be too hard. But I have to maintain a 0. 0 to please myself. That's attainable too, though. I know myself good enough to know that I will put everything else aside if my grades start to slip. Like last night, I really didn't want to stay in, but I had to catch up on a lot of things. Yep, I'll definitely maintain. No problem. Bye, bye, bye. Man, I hate that song. I wish stupid songs wouldn't get stuck in my head. I've always wondered about the stars. I think it would be the ultimate thing to impress a girl if you took her on a picnic and could lay and look at the stars and point out all the constellations. Hey, then maybe I should take Astrology for my science. After all, I do need two semesters of a science to graduate Business Honors. But I heard that that class was semidifficult, and I need an easy A in my science class. It can't be that bad though. I mean, after all, how hard can looking at the stars be. But in all sciences, they find ways to talk about stuff that I wouldn't have ever imagined could be taught about. Dang, I hate science. All sciences. Well, I guess social sciences aren't that bad. But those aren't really sciences. Just the basic ones bio, chem. , physics, yeah, can't stand those. All right, only ten minutes left. I would have guessed that in ten minutes I would have thought about more stuff. Guess not. What is time? I mean, it is time to us, but why should the universe revolve around humans. I'm sure there are other beings somewhere out there, but we don't have proof. There were those circles in the wheat fields somewhere, but that's not proof. Just some stupid Iowan rednecks trying to get publicity. Just like that kid who is now charging PROPNAME PROPNAME with abuse. That's so stupid. Just a publicity stunt. It is so apparent to everyone that he didn't do anything wrong. He may have been a little stern in the manner he addressed the kid, but that is nothing that should be brought to the forefront like this. Stupid. I can't wait until college basketball starts, that is the best time of year. Although I go to UT now, I will always be a ORGNAME basketball fan. I have been since I can remember. That's not bad is it? Nah. I enjoy college football, but it just isn't the same to me. I guess it's because college basketball has more action, and because the kids actually care. Not like the ORGNAME. All of them are lazy and just worried about the money, whereas the ORGNAME the kids play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back. But I guess there are some players who don't do that. Oh well, I don't care. Bye, bye, bye. Dang, stop it. I need to hook up with a girl tonight. I've been here too long not to have yet. It really gets me how people can have random sex. I'm quite proud to be a virgin, and I will be until I get married. And I know that God will keep me strong. Like my roommate. I just don't understand. Bye, bye, bye. All right. This thing is finally over. One less thing I have to worry about. 
__label__label0 Well, this is my second writing assignment to try to submit. I tried Monday and Wednesday, Monday it wouldn't even let me on the site, and Wednesday it teased meit let me type the entire stream, and then erased it when I tried to submit it. So, hopefully this one works, because I can't find ORGNAME Word on this PC. I wish I could go to sleep because I am so tired. Last night I went to 0th Street and I had blisters on my feet. This morning, I had to get up and go to work. AND MY FEET HURT. I am never going to 0th again, it is hell! I want to go to sleep, but I am here, writing this. At 0:00 I have to go get my Hep shot, yuck. Then I get ready to work the ORGNAME 00 concert. I promise that I am going to go to sleep as SOON as I get home and I am not going to get up until I have to go to work on Sunday. Old ORGNAME did not schedule me at all for next week, normally I would be happy, but I am trying to save up for a down payment on a new car!. My boyfriend, of 0 months got a new truck last weekend, and now I am on a kick too I want a ORGNAME ORGNAME. All I do is get on the Internet and look at cars when I should be studying, because my parents said they would only help me with the car if I did well in school. Therefore, I need to concentrate on SCHOOL. I am such a busybee, I need to do a load of laundry before the weekend rush begins. I am sure sometime you lived in a dorm too it is hell trying to do laundry. Bat0hing might b nice, I am sure that when I was on the bus earlier that I STUNK badly. Oh well, the people on the bus didn't smell to hot either. I have a test next week in my Geography class and I need to study for that too. AHHHHHH, college is all about managing your time and not getting behind. (which I am). I should have listened during all of those sessions about how to succeed in school, because I doubt that I am doing very well right now. I really wish that I could go home next weekend because my mom is going to be in the hospital, she has to have a hysterectomy??? I have no clue if I spelled that right. I think that it would be so sweet if I showed up in LOCNAME and brought her flowers and all of that good stuff. I love her so much and if it wasn't for her I don't know what I would have done. I guess this weekend I will go buy her a card and prepare to go home this weekend. I know that I might not get an hours next week, but that is OK, because I really don't need any money anyway, like I said, I am trying to save up for a new car. Right now I don't have anything going through my mind other than. SLEEP, and food. And a shower, all of the necessities of life. Well my twenty minutes is almost up, only four minutes to go. I am such a slow typist. I hope this concert is worth all of the work, because I am dead tired. I probably should be going to sleep instead of going to the concert but, oh well. It is a great opportunity to see the show for a little work. I am sure that makes sense to anyone, right? My room is such a mess, my roommate and I really need to clean it. Unfortunately, my twenty minutes are up, and I am going to go to BED!  
__label__label1 I don't really know how to start a "stream ORGNAME consciousness" writing, but I guess I will write about how I feel about college right now. It PROPNAME my first year and it is really scary but fun at PROPNAME same time. I guess I haven't really had enough time to sit down and think about all that I have done since I have been here. It is exhausting to think how much I have actually been doing. I'm not a morning person so my days start around 00:00. From that point on I do not stop until about 00am, when I pass out. My days are filled completely with going to class, studying, meetings, and then of course going out. I have met so PROPNAMEy people since I have been here. I barely remember anyone's name. I feel so bad when someone comes up to me and calls me by my name and I can't even remember ever meeting them. I'm sure that has happened to everyone before, but it seems to happen to me at least once a day. Oh well, life goes on. At least I remember my roommate's name. She is cool! We both went potluck and got extremely lucky. We get along like sisters, and people even think we look alike. It's crazy. This writing seems like a bunch of gibber gabber but I guess I am following the guidelines by writing what is on my mind. I think this is a cool exercise because it is actually giving me the time to sit down and think about what's on my mind. One thing that is always on my mind is how I miss home. I am used to my mom always taking care of almost everything for me. That makes me sound like a baby, but I am an independent person. I took care of my mom for two years while she was in bed sick. That was the point in my life when I grew up really fast. I had to go to work and school, cook dinner, go to the cleaners, and everything that I could do to help out around the house. When she got better, I guess is when I became lazy and wanted her to help me do a lot of things. She is awesome and I really miss her. My PROPNAME is an entire different story. He lives in LOCNAME and does not do one thing for anybody except himself. He didn't raise us so he doesn't really know how to act like a father. My step dad is the man who acts as my father. He takes care of me the way my father is supposed to. I really miss him as well. If it weren't for him I would not be typing this essay on this computer, or going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as well. I am very thankful for everything he has done for me. I am bad at showing it sometimes, but I think he knows in my heart how appreciative I am. Another thing that I miss is my sister. She goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME. I tell her everything because she is my best friend. I don't know what I would do without the telephone. She makes me feel better whenever I have a problem or am upset. I guess this entire essay is about how much I miss my family. I am thinking that maybe I should go home soon and visit. Actually that could be bad, I need to grow up someday. I have two more minutes that I have to write. I feel better about being away from home now that I have expressed what I miss on paper. I have always heard when you write things down it makes you feel better, and this just proved that to me. I hope this makes some since. Goodbye have a good day! 
__label__label1 Right now, I am feeling a little tired, a little overwhelmed, excited, and also a little afraid. I am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise. I am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that I have found myself in in the last couple of weeks. Its not really that I am overloaded with work (yet), it is just that I am still getting used to everything here: new and different classes, new ways of studying and testing, new teachers and techniques of teaching, etc. I am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings: a new room, roommate, sleeping schedule, eating schedule, etc. I am excited because I think I am going to enjoy living and going to school here. I am excited about taking courses that I'm actually interested in, and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing. I am excited about meeting new people. One of the things that I enjoy most about LOCNAME is the diversity of the people you can find here. No matter what kind of person you are, you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns. I have already met some very fascinating people. Austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the ORGNAME. If I'm not mistaken, it is the music capitol of the world. I could go on for a long time about all the reasons why I am excited. I am afraid mainly for the same reasons that I am overwhelmed. Mostly I am afraid that I do not know how to take notes and study properly. I find myself looking at others people's notes during lecture to see if I am writing down the important things and whether or not I am getting the point. My mom says that in time, I will learn what to write down, read, and study. I have never been a very good test taker. My biggest fear of all is the fact that I have always relied on the one on one attention that I received from my teachers in the past to get me through school. Now that I am attending the largest University in the county, I know that that is impractical. However, I plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids. With an average of 000 students in your classes, I know that you cannot offer that same oneonone environment. That is my greatest concern. 
__label__label1 Ok, so I'm sitting here wondering what I'm going to eat for dinner, even though I'm not hungry. My roommate just told me what there is at jester and she also told me that she waited to do her homework until I woke up because she didn't want the printer to wake me up. She is so sweet. She has selfesteem issues that she takes medication for and for the life of me I can't understand people like this. It's like I want to just tell them to snap out of it. It's very frustrating for me because I don't understand it. She and I talked about this issue last night before we went to sleep. I told her how I felt and we've come to an understanding. I'm starting to miss my parents. I feel very sad for my mother because I know she misses me a lot. I don't tell my mother often enough how much I love and respect her I should do this. I stood in line for an hour today for football tickets for the OU game in LOCNAME. I love it here but it will be nice to return to a place I am so familiar with. I hope PROPNAME forgets about her exboyfriend PROPNAME. She is so cool. I am really glad we met one another. He is such a weirdo and she is so smart and independent and ambitious. I don't see how she does it. I mean, she's doing the ORGNAME TV station thing and Comm council and an internship at the capitol, and 00 hrs. and she just has to obtain a 0. 0 or she'll just die. Me on the other hand, I'm just trying to make it here. I'm used to doing it all. I handled everything going on in High School, but that was dealing with 000 people and easy classes that I swore were hard. I just really hope I make the novice rowing team here. I've put so much time and energy in preparation for tryouts. I work out everyday and go out of my way to get noticed. PROPNAME just called about us going to get our meningitis shots tomorrow. I also need to get my chicken pox vaccination because I've never had them and I don't want to get them now, because I'm afraid I'll like die or something. My mother should have exposed me to them when I was a child. I just saw PROPNAME and she wasn't very nice. I hope she's not mad at me. I have to go to the boathouse and run a lot tomorrow and I'm sitting here dreading it. But, if I make the team it will all be worth it. My roommate snores really loud at night. I plug my ears with cotton. It angers me. It's very difficult to sleep. I have so many things to do. I feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to do what I need to get done. Austin is really hot. I hope PROPNAME and PROPNAME work things out. He loves her so much and I really want them to be together. I'm thinking about the OU game again. I am so excited to see him and my other cousin. They are big UT fans. They are so happy that I am going here. I almost feel bad, because I guess I didn't really consider it that big of a deal that I got in. Everywhere I go, people look at me in awe when I tell them I go to school here. Well, I'm going to stop writing now. It's been 00 minutes and all I can think about is all the stuff I have to do now. I have Journalism, Rhetoric and Geography homework so I'm going to get started. 
__label__label0 I have so many stressors in my life right now, and I've decided that since I have to do this stream of consciousness exercise anyway, this is probably the best place to vent. While being a freshman on a campus of 00,000 people is intimidating and scary, it isn't nearly as threatening as people made it out to be  at least not yet. My current stressful situations lie in areas of my life that have nothing to do with college. To be honest, right now, my biggest problem is with my parents. After being divorced for some time now, they have just gotten to the point where they have started to fight and bicker about everything, and of course, I always end up in the middle. My mother complains about how difficult her life is because of my father, which I'm sure it is. This is not to say that he is a perfect person, because I know he is not, but the way she portrays him, you would think that he is not human. My father is very critical and judgmental of everything my mother does, and the both of them feel the constant need to tell me how they feel about the other. Now, I am adult enough to realize that after a bitter divorce, there will certainly be problems. They have every right in the world to be furious with each other. All I ask is that they do not drag me into the middle of it. I have told them both this on several occasions, and they both apologize and vow to not do it again. However, before long, they are up to the same old game again, and it makes me feel about 0 inches tall. I am forced to choose sides, and since I love both my parents, this provides for a very stressful situation. I am getting to the point that I am ready to tell them both that I will not speak to either of them or have any contact what so ever until they talk to each other and get at least to the point where they can tolerate living in the same city with one another. I don't ask that they try to love each other again, or even like each other, because those days are obviously through. I just want things to be relatively peaceful and not for there to be a war zone. Another result of this fighting is the separation of me and my siblings. This has nothing to do with the fact that I live on campus, my little sister lives with my mom, and my brother lives with my dad. While this isn't the ideal living situation, there is certainly nothing awful about it. What their fighting has caused is rifts between the kids. It has gotten to the point that we choose sides against our parents, and therefore, against each other. I feel like I can't say anything bad about my mother in front of my sister because she will just run back and report what I say. If I wanted to say those things to my mom, I would say them. I don't need a messenger. Dr PROPNAME, if you are reading this, I accidentally pressed send and did not get to complete my writing. I apologize and hope this doesn't cause any problems. Anyway, another problem I have with my family is the direct relationship between my mother and I. We have always had different personalities, and they have often clashed. We would sometimes go long periods of time when we were furious with each other, but for some reason, I feel that my current situation is the worst. She has recently undergone a lot of personal changes, mostly physical. She is in the process of discovering who she is, which is a perfectly normal thing to do after having a life as tumultuous as hers. She changed her last name, has dyed her hair several different colors, and is seriously considering a nose ring. Now, on an intellectual level, I totally understand her actions. If I were in her shoes, I would want to discover who I was also, and would feel hurt if my daughter did not approve. HOWEVER, these changes she has made still upset me immensely, and she cannot comprehend or accept why I feel this way. Until recently, I could not even explain it to myself. Through talking with a friend, I think I've begun to grasp why I have a problem with this. And here is my answer: the relationship a person has with their mother is supposed to be one of the most meaningful, important relationships of their lives. A mother, no matter how hard you try to escape her, will always be there for you and provide comfort and support. You KNOW who this person is, and they are usually a steady force in your life. Even before my mother began undergoing these changes, we had drifted apart so that I barely knew who she was. And now, after changing herself, I really don't know her. She does not seem to be a rock for my life. The hardest part for me is that she doesn't seem to care how I feel and that her changes upset me. I am not the most emotionally open person, but the fact that she was changing her name was upsetting me so that I actually confronted her about it. This is so unlike me, so I felt very vulnerable in my action. After I told her I was having a problem, she seemed sincerely concerned, and promised that we would talk about it further before she did anything. However, two days later, before we talked more, she went and changed her name anyway. I never asked her to change her life or actions for my sake. All I wanted was for her to know how I felt and that she was upsetting me. Honestly, I think this is a reasonable request. Her apparent disregard for my feelings hurt me tremendously, and we are on very bad terms at the present time. I feel very alone right now, and I'm not sleeping well. My appetite has gone down very much, and I can't seem to find pleasure in anything I do. The friends I had in high school have all moved away, and the new friends I've made at LOCNAME always seem to have more important things to do. I am nowhere near the top of anybody's priority list, and I often feel like if I were to just pack up and clear out, very few people would notice. Now, if anybody is reading this, don't think this is a plea of help from a person considering suicide. That thought doesn't come into my mind, I am just having a rough time. I know that one of Dr. PROPNAME's favorite stress relievers is to sit down and write about 'your deepest thoughts and feelings. ' At this point, I would have to agree with him that this exercise is very helpful and calms my nerves a bit. I don't know what I'll write about for other stream of consciousness exercises, because I've pretty much said everything of dire importance to me here on this page. I hope that if anybody in my life reads this and is upset by it, that they will understand that I have a special circumstance in Dr. PROPNAME's class, and I just want to be treated like all the other freshmen who have the opportunity to write and write without consequence. I know that this is just an assignment, but I truly appreciate this opportunity to vent my frustrations and do a little thinking. Thank you. 
__label__label0 It may be tough to come up with an abundance ORGNAME ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed LOCNAME for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at ORGNAME ORGNAME with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. 
__label__label1 Why do they make us do this? Do they want to figure out what thought leads to the next? Like the autistic people where their thoughts lead them to the next, but only one leads to the next, perhaps a smell or feeling or emotion. I wonder what those people feel. I wonder if they are deprived of some of the things we are. I remember hearing that they can do brilliant things, compose symphonies and paint incredible things, but need help to button their shirt. Wasn't that movie starring PROPNAME PROPNAME who tried to no that wasn't it. I don't remember who starred in it. Maybe it was someone who looked like PROPNAME PROPNAME  didn't we watch that movie in eighth grade? The one about the people who didn't react to normal stimulants? The ones who tossed the ball around from one person to the next, but didn't engage in conversations? Engage that's a good word. My roommates and I were talking about funny words the other day. PROPNAME thought that "fib" was a good word, and there was something else I said by the elevator. It might have been. enthralled, That was it! I remember now. I love great words. If I could have an extensive vocabulary, I think perhaps I would be taken more seriously. There was a cabdriver tonight that knew a lot of big words. I asked him to write one of my papers. What was he doing driving a cab? Can't he find some other occupation that suits him better. Maybe he likes to meet people. Perhaps he finds it interesting to encounter different personalities. Why can't he get a better job? There have to be much better things to do. But what about that movie American Beauty where PROPNAME PROPNAME quit his job and started to flip burgers that was a good movie. Maybe that's what made him happy. To do jobs that don't require a truck load of thought. But then again he found out that his wife was cheating on him. That really sucks. I would never do that kind of thing to my boyfriend. That's downright mean. What kind of girl would do that? There's no way in hell anyone would ever find me doing that and speaking of stupid things, what about suicide? Why do people do that, or rather why would they ever think about it. That is so selfish. If I ever found out my friends were thinking about it I'd beat them into the ground. What would make them think that there is nothing left in the world for them? Do they think no one loves them or cares for them? I just don't get it. What a stupid thing to think or consider. Some people have real problems. I had a conversation like this with my kickboxing instructor one time. It was after the cardio kickboxing class and I was talking with him. I don't know how we got on the subject, but he told me this story about one of the guys that used to go there a first degree black belt and he committed suicide. In fact, I knew the family. The mom actually helped me with this paper I was writing for my really tough English teacher. Little did I know that not only was my English teacher tough, he was brilliant. I have such a great respect for that man. Some day, when I make it big  and the word is "when" because it will happen  I'm going to send him a shit load of money for retirement. I have so many plans for when I get older. I'm going to start a scholarship in my name and all this other grand stuff that I can't think of right now. Oh look at that, the time is up. catch you later. 
__label__label0 Wow. what an assignment. I can barely type. I hope I will learn to write better. I keep listening to rosie on tv. A soda sounds good. I wonder when I will finally get mail. My parents were supposed to send me some stamps. I bet they got stolen. I wonder if avery will ever write to me. He says that he wrote me a letter like a week ago. Well were is it. I wonder if I will last for 00 minutes. I wonder what PROPNAME and mine relationship will be like while he is on his mission. I feel like a machine right now. I went to the health clinic. That was kind of weird but everyone was nice to me. It is so normal for someone to be sexually active. THey are so surprised to hear they you are a virgin. I was raised right and I actually learned what they taught. Some people have to learn the hard way at the expense of others. Abortion is the worst thing someone can just blow off. just because someone is being stupid and lustful they feel when they get pregnant that their mistakes should not come with the consequences. I wish I could watch PROPNAME of eat something instead of this. It is kind of fun though. I wonder if PROPNAME is coming down this weekend to visit me. My stupid computer will not ever work. My roommate is nice to let me borrow her computer. I wonder what mandy and PROPNAME are doing. I have a message from my sister. I think it is PROPNAME. She has been so helpful. I need to concentrate. I need to read my scriptures. How much longer do I have to write. My fingers are about to fall off. I keep making so many mistakes. AAAHHH! this is frustrating trying to keep up with my thoughts. This sure does help my writing speed. go girl go. I want to call sheila. I wonder if they are cooking or something. I already have a sandwich in the refrigerator from lunch. That is so stupid that they don't allow you to take food out of the cafe. I did. I paid for it. They just want to reap you off. Well I won't let them. I can't think I am thinking too hard. I wonder what avery is doing. I wish I could talk to him. It is driving me almost to the point of worry. I wonder if the mail is here yet. I am so glad this assignment is easy. I wonder what kind of awful things people write. I feel almost sorry for the professors that have to read this. I bet it will take forever. I wonder what kind of experiments I will participate in. My shoulder hurts. I wonder how often I will actually work out. I am so sore. How much longer. YEs 0 minutes. Praise the lord. I said a curse word today and I am not happy with myself. I don't want to get back into that habit. I am not a happy or truly happy person when I curse. It is not a nice thing to do. I wonder what the professors are thinking. I waited for the bus forever today. I thought I was going to die in this heat. My writing is getting worse. I am getting a headache. I wonder what it would be like to have a cat. I like twinkles but cats are so moody. I miss my dog PROPNAME. the cutest thing in the world. I wonder what they are doing at home. I wonder what they are eating. I am hungry. I miss eating with PROPNAME. will he ever write me. Is he too busy. I never heard of that. I am starting to get mad now. he was all worried about me dating other guys and he doesn't even take the effort to buy a stamp and mail it. I wonder if it got lost. I hope I get one soon. I am finally done. 
__label__label0 I always knew college was about being on your own and being independent. Maybe I have been so busy that I didn't realize I was completely on my own until I got sick. Being sick is just one of those things I have never had to accomplish on my own. I always had my mom to take me to the doctor and even after I could drive, I still loved her company. I also knew that she would get me my medicine and make sure I was taken good care of. Being away from my mom and that comfort zone was not very easy when I became sick. It has definitely shown me that I depend on other people a lot, especially my mom. If there is one thing I am looking forward to about college, it is growing as a person. I hope to become more independent and prepare myself for the future years ahead. I always went away to camp during the summer and spent six weeks in LOCNAME one summer but for some reason, being in college is a much different feeling. I want to be able to do things completely on my own without consulting others, like my parents. I think the greatest thing I need to conquer is decisionmaking. I have always been bad at making up my own mind without asking someone else if I am making the right decision. I hope being in college will teach me to make good decisions and become that independent person I want to become. Already being away from home has taught me so much about myself and how it feels to be distant from that comfort zone. Just like most things, I know it will only take time and patience. 
__label__label1 Um. well I don't know where to start. This is extremely weird and I feel like I am just going to start rambling on and on. I think I'm thinking too hard for this little assignment and it's driving me crazy I guess I'll just go off on tangents and type away. I am so bored out of my mind and everyone around me right now is talking about being hungry and going to get something to eat. I shouldn't have eaten that can of soup and should have waited and gone some place good wit my friends. What am I thinking what am I thinking about. This is so much harder than I though. I thought things were just going to flow and I'm sure that they usually do but since I'm concentrating so much things are flowing like they usually do. I'm so stressed out right now. For some reason I feel like I have a world of things to do, do I? Well I know that when I think to hard about all the things I have to do it seems like I'm never going to finish doing what I have to do. In the long run though things seem to work and yeah I'm not going to freak out. I think right now I'm going to go back to my apartment and plan out exactly what I have to do for the rest of the day then get a pen and just scratch out as I go along. I know that I'll fall asleep though. I've been so lazy lately. I think I should start running to get my blood flowing but I know myself and it'll never last. Well who knows we'll see what happens, I could just go home and clean the apartment that would be a good work out. I think I'm thinking too much about unimportant things I guess who cares I'm just going to do whatever I want to do as things come to my mind and I'm not going to force myself into jogging around and sweating then never wanted to run again. Holy cow! This is not fun at all I'm running out of thoughts and this is just becoming words jumbled on to a paper. I wonder if I'm suppose to have paragraphs and stuff oh well too bad. Is this suppose to be something important or say something about myself. If it wasn't for having to type this my day would be complete I could take a nice long nap without having to worry about getting this out on time! Ugh! Okay I wish I could just live in LOCNAME and not go to school. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight? Nothing is fun anymore it's always all the same stuff. Um well jayne and them are coming in from LOCNAME LOCNAME so we'll see what happens. This movie is so cheap I laugh at the stupid parts even though they make no sense what so ever. What a mess what a mess. Ugh I need to clean up my home today so bad I don't want to! I clean up and two seconds later it's a mess all over again. Okay well I'm thinking my time should be up. Is it up yet. Yes two minutes and them I'm done. I'm starving all of a sudden. I'm so frustrated with this whole thinking process It's just a mess I hope we don't have to do this all the time. I think I'm going to be disappointed when I read back on this. I'm going to see that not one productive thought runs through my mind in 00 minutes. That is so pathetic. I wonder what would happen if I didn't have to do this and I started jotting down my thoughts. Okay time is up. 
__label__label1 Stream of Consciousness Where could she have gone? She has been gone for 00 hours now and she did not even tell me where she was going. She left at 0:00 in the morning and it is now one in the afternoon. All she said was she was going to buy cigarettes and she would be back in fifteen minutes. Oh God what could have happened to her. I do not know what I would do with out her. Rally what would I do if she wasn't around anymore. She is my best friend, my sister. We have been through so much together. She knows everything. Every secret, every feeling, every lie, every cry, everything. Please be okay, please be okay. Where could she have gone? She could have gone to A&M to see PROPNAME. Or maybe she went to Waco to visit PROPNAME. No she wouldn't do that; she has not talked to PROPNAME since Monday. She wouldn't just leave without telling me where she was going. Maybe she went to see PROPNAME at LOCNAME. No, she couldn't have. They were in a fight last time she talked to him. Please just be safe. I am totally helpless right now. I have called everyone and left everyone messages. Who is going to call her mother? I have to tell her. No one else can do it. She is my mom too. I am the only one close enough to her to tell her what is going on here. She is there, in LOCNAME, and she is going to freak out when she finds out here daughter has been missing for 00 hours now. I hope PROPNAME is all right. I am going to be so relieved when I see her, if I see her. Relived, I am going to be pissed. How could she not call and tell me where she was going? It is the responsibility of a roommate to tell the other one where you are going. Who else can I call? I have to call somebody. Somebody has to know her whereabouts. I can't ever talk to anyone right now. I am hysterical. Calm down; just clam down, PROPNAME. Everything is going to be okay. Should I wait to call her mom until after I talk to the police? NO that is wrong. It would be one in the morning when the police would finally do something. She couldn't do anything then. She would be as helpless as I am right now. That is not fair to her. She wouldn't be able to do anything at one in the morning. She would be totally freaked out in tears. Okay breathe, breathe. You can do this. Just dial the number. Come on push the buttons. Stop crying and do what you know you have to do. Stop crying, PROPNAME. 
__label__label0 ahhhh. I can't take it anymore, living with PROPNAME. I seriously don't understand what we are. Well, actually I think I do but just won't admit it. We're friends with benefits, that's terrible. We sleep in the same bed every night, and we cuddle, I rub he's back every night before I go to bed, and then he turns over and I rub his chest and stomach, and every morning his arm is around me. But every time I go to bed I always remind myself to stay far away from him as possible on the bed. like I always try to have my back facing him, but sometimes I can't help especially since his place is always so cold. I feel terrible that denniele has to sleep on the floor, and sometimes yeah erik and I will do it when she's only a few feet away. The thing is erik and I are really good in bed, but its more than that. It's really hard to get over someone when you're living with them, I want to move on I really do, I just I still like PROPNAME. our relationship is really weird though, I mean he still has the picture of him and I out on his bed stand, and he'll do these cute little favors, why?! Why are men so difficult to understand? They want one thing, but do another, its like shit make your mind. They say we play games whatever. D and I just need to move out of there, but how can we when we can't even get approve for an apartment, we were suppose to move out like 0 weeks ago, but didn't get approve. It's really nice of PROPNAME, my exboyfriend to let us stay at his place. D still doesn't have a job, but she's going through all these problems, she's so depressed and I'm really glad she's finally seeking help for it. The position she's in must be really difficult especially with me and PROPNAME around. The other night, his exfiance called from LOCNAME I know it was her it had to be. Well, since I did read his mail, and she's trying to find him, and the girl in the photograph who's half naked in his drawer is his ex he just won't admit to me. Ahhh. he's an asshole, but I still want him, why because as much as we don't want to admit, girls like the asshole because it's much more exciting there's a chase. But when a good guy comes you don't want him, strange huh. Anyways, D and I just need to meet new people that's all, but where? Seriously, where do we find new guys, not 0th street that's the worse place to go to. Shit I know he's out there somewhere, I shouldn't even be worrying about this stuff, there's so much I'm going through, with school and work, all this pressure I don't know even I can handle it. I'm really afraid of what the future holds for me. I really miss my family I haven't been home since spring break and I haven't seen my family since June, it's terrible that I didn't even go home at all this summer, I guess the reason I stayed was because of PROPNAME. PROPNAME was my first boyfriend, but not my first sexual partner, I was raped. He's so adorable, ahhh! I still remember our first conversation and the first times we went out and dated, ahhh! Oh, goodness I saw PROPNAME last weekend, well he gained weight, and now has a girlfriend, good for him as long as he is happy then I am happy for him. I've always wanted to know what would have happened if I had told him how I felt about him. But then I met PROPNAME, so who knows. I am so behind in all my classes, I've barely read for anything which is terrible. I just can't study at home at all, I get so distracted with PROPNAME and D being there. I am so indebt right now, I owe all these institutions money. Because of my irresponsibility that's why. Oh well, I know everything will be okay. I feel so fat I'm 000, right now I want to be at least 000, agrrrr. patience I'll be there, I just haven't had the time though to go down to gregory to workout. It's really just my tummy that's big, I still can't believe I got my belly button pierced last week, heheheh. I'm working today and the next two days, I need to make some mad money. Whatever happens happens, right. I wonder how my papa is doing where is he, somewhere on the road probably. I hope my dad and my sister are talking to each other, it's really hard when you have two daughters and one is always and the other one barely talks to you. I hope my mother is okay, I'm sure she is. Oh anyways, D's parents oh I love them they have helped me so much and guided me through a lot. The last few nights have been really fun, sitting outside with D for hours and just talking we haven't done that in a long time. I guess living with PROPNAME though we have no privacy what so ever, she doesn't either. I hope she finds someone good, she's good person who deserves someone that will treat her right. OH and her brother deserves someone good as well, goodness I had the biggest crush over him this summer and PROPNAME, too again. I saw PROPNAME the other day, still so cute. But he's just so good, he doesn't deserve someone like me, trust me. What's up with PROPNAME, I miss her I haven't spoken to her in like a month, how is she doing medically. HMmm! I really need to go home to LOCNAME and visit everyone I actually need a break from LOCNAME, I think I guess I'm just afraid to leave D and PROPNAME alone in the apt. , its so sad that I don't even trust them together. I know I don't I've never trusted PROPNAME, and I don't think he ever trusted me from the beginning and maybe that's why our relationship didn't work. He knew that I used to have feelings for PROPNAME, and yet I hung out with the dude probably more than I did with PROPNAME this summer. hmmm like I said I need to find fresh meat. ehehehe 
__label__label0 I am so exhausted. These last few weeks since school has started has worn me out. I have pretty much no energy, and I got ten hours of sleep last night. My brain is also exhausted from all the partying I have been doing since I got here. I can't wait for tonight. I am going to club Elements, and I am going be wasted. I love techno music. It is so awesome. It is crazy how a DJ can put all sorts of different beats together at once and make it sound so perfect. I could listen to techno music all day long. I am listening to techno music right now. Every time I hear techno music it makes me want to dance and have a good time. Anyways, I hope LOCNAME kicks some ass on Saturday. I love watching ORGNAME play football and tear it up. College football is the best sport in the world to watch. My other favorite team to watch in college is LOCNAME. My dad went there so I have been a true LOCNAME fan ever since I was little. I even went to the Rose Bowl in 0000 when they played LOCNAME LOCNAME. They won and LOCNAME ended the season undefeated and number one in the nation. In choosing the college that I wanted to go to, it was a choice between LOCNAME and ORGNAME. My brother graduated from ORGNAME a few years ago and I really looked up to him greatly as a kid. I finally decided to follow my brother and go to UT. So far I feel it was a great choice. Austin is an awesome city that fits well with my personality. I decided that if I want to continue my studies and get a masters degree, then I will probably go to LOCNAME for that. Right now, that is my plan for the next seven or eight years of my life. However, I really don't know what exactly I want my major to be. Anyways, off of that subject, there are so many fine girls here. Everywhere I look there is another girl that I want a piece of. I t is awesome. I have never seen so many hot chicks in my life. The whole experience of living down here so far has been awesome. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. And it is great living far away from home. Nothing beats coming in at five in the morning and not having to hear my mom or dad bitch at me. Actually, my parents were very good parents and usually let me have my space. They learned after the first two kids what it is like parenting kids, so they were pretty loose with me. I really do kind off miss my parents. They are very good people who gave me a lot during my stay at home and they would do anything for me. They have always been there for me even when I have been in trouble with authorities and other high officials. Not that I was a bad teenager or anything, but I think everyone who likes to party a lot, like me, have had their share of conflict with the cops. Anyways, twenty minutes is up, so bye. 
__label__label1 I'm starting to write this at six twenty five, It's really cold in this computer lab, I wish they would turn the air conditioner down, do they know how to do that, would they do it if I asked them, probably not, but I wish they would, there sure is a lot of typing noise going on in the room, no one is talking, I am thinking more things that I am actually typing, it is really hard to write everything that I think and I type a lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, I am not thinking of much right now, the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it, he probably won't read it though, and he probably won't really think it is dumb, there are probably students who write dumber ones than me. I am horrible at typing, I am making all kinds of mistakes, I hope I can read this a when I finish it, or else there will be a problem, brrrr It's really cold in here, I sure wish they would make it warmer. My fingers and my feet are freezing, and I'm already bad enough at typing, the cold makes it even harder to type, geeze I'm going to have to do a lot of spell checking after I finish this, I only have about ten minutes of typing left, I just heard someone's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab, I always hear phones ring in here anyways, I wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that, they should turn their phones off, so they don't disrupt other people, even though personally it doesn't bother me if I hear a phone ring but I guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying, gosh I can't spell worth anything, I'm hardly going to be able to read this when I get done, I hope I can decipher it, my feet are freezing, I keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that's the point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated. I wonder if its raining outside, that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere, I wonder why I thought of that, hhhmmm, I saw all the clouds earlier outside, it was really dark and scary looking, I hope it rains a lot more, more than yesterday, it didn't rain enough yesterday, I love when it rains, it's better than the sunshine, I wonder if that means I'm a negative person, it can't though cause I am such a positive and optimistic person, well at least I think of myself as optimistic, I try to be optimistic but sometimes its hard, like last week I was so stressed out with all the band stuff, I'm really glad I quit band cause it was too hard but it was hard deciding to quit too, I wonder if anybody in band misses me, I wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me, I hope some of them did, but I guess that's not a good thing to hope considering I have a boyfriend, I really miss my boyfriend a lot, and I just thought about macaroni and cheese for some weird reason, I wonder why I thought of that, maybe cause both me and my boyfriend like macaroni and cheese, I'm such a horrible typist, this typing is probably the worse I've ever done, I only have a couple of minutes left to go, gosh time really went but fast since I was just typing anything I thought, I wonder if the professor will really read this, he is a really cool professor, I like him a lot, but now if he does read this he's probably going to think I was sucking up to him but that's not true cause I really love psychology, that's a hard word to spell, well its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it's spelled, I remember when I was in the spelling bee in 0th grade, I think it was fourth grade, maybe it was third, I remember my ex best friend who was in my third grade class, I didn't really know her then but now she is really stupid but I don't really want to think about that right now and my twenty minutes is up so I guess I'll stop typing! 
__label__label1 why in the world do we have to do everything online? I don't have a computer yet PC Mall told me that the one that I wanted would be at least a month because it's backordered. My friend is singing bad German grammar phrases. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and I just ordered a pizza, and now we're worried that we will get fat. She's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. I think that I will party hard on Saturday night but not as hard as on last Friday. I got really inebriated and bruised myself in several nondiscreet places. PROPNAME is trying to dictate what I should be writing, but this is my assignment, not hers. PROPNAME smokes crack, and PROPNAME likes to hum really bad show tunes. PROPNAME, please turn the light back on. PROPNAME just came in wearing an American Outpost shirt. I think that this computer does not like me very much. This Cure song is so wonderful. I'm going to ORGNAME ORGNAME's on Tuesday so that I can shake my groove thing to some quaint 00s tunes. Simple Minds, PROPNAME PROPNAME, ORGNAME, LOCNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME, The GoGos, TheB00sthey're all wonderful! I think that I need to go shopping for some new clothes sometime soon. I should have brought my music down here. Would I wear a black lace skirt with nothing underneath? Probably not, but I wouldn't put it past myself. PROPNAME loves to hump monkeys, and PROPNAME likes to screw donkeys. The pizza man better hurry the hell up I'm starving! This room is really freaking cold (chilly is not cool). The music just got louder, but it's not any better. I don't think that I would look very good in a charcoal gray skirt. Red is definitely my color. My radishes were growing mold, so I threw them out. Old ORGNAME is for high schoolers, Gap is for college kids, and LOCNAME LOCNAME is for the working world. How much longer do I need to type on this damn computer? I would rather write by hand any day. I think my eyes are glazing over from the absurd brightness of the screen. Oohback cramps! My vixen red nail polish is chipping time to redo. random thoughts are running through my head. rings on my fingers but no bells on my toes PROPNAME has a rash on her leg. Big bruise on my thigh. Now I'm just making stuff up. Are my 00 minutes up yet? Guess not. When I start typing randomly, I don't make any sense. Ladybugs everywhere. Ska is fun. Come on PROPNAME. I'm out of things to talk about now it's all going downhill. 
__label__label1 I am running from something. From who I was and where I was. Maybe not running from. Maybe running to something. Everything I see changes. My life is one constant storm, one sunset. I don't spend enough time thinking about who I am. I am attracted to things that are not always the best for me. I think I can fix them. I like to visit my past. Sometimes it is nice to bask in something comfortable. I sit in your glow and warmth. I run to you thinking that you will wrap me in your arms offer me something stable. Something that makes me feel like I know something about my life. I was thinking today as I was walking on campus that you are the only one I would like to run up to and kiss. Then you come at me with your fists up and all I can do is shrivel and draw back. I loose the urge to hold you. for a minute. I wish I could shake you. I sometimes wish I could shake myself. Just get out of my own life for a minute so I would get a new perspective. Do you think I am wonderful? Do you wish that I would let you love me? When I was running today I pounded out all of my aggression and all that I was left with was tears. Do you ever have the feeling that anger is a mask for pain. I think I play that game a lot. Hide what I feel. Or maybe I don't ask. Don't look inside my heart. Too many challenges follow. I am happy though. Proud of myself for the distance that I have walked and that I take another step every day. I wish you would stop me sometimes. Grab my hand and beg me to say. Tell me from your own mouth what your life is like with out me. Admit to me that I am the light that causes you to have a shadow. You never admit things like that. Too much pride to loose I guess. I let you fill me. I made you my home. Then so much of what I thought we had and what I thought we were did not exist. Very confusing. And painful to tell you and me the truth. I wish I had something beautiful to say. I wish I was the rain that washed down over the whole world. Beautiful gray drops that just make you want to stay in your warm bed. They are comfort and beauty and a rare surprise. They can be gentle and subtle. Or they can fall with a vengeance drench you make you remember things you want to forget. Create a spectacle in the sky. Lightening strikes my heart. I wish I was the lightening that struck your heart. Then I remember that I am lucky. So many people never find what I have. The ability to love, be loved, lay beside someone. Hold them, think them, feel them. I am lucky to have found people that will hold me with out making me pay them back, love me without asking when I will notice. With those people in mind I decide to get out of the life I live with you. Focus on them. Devote time to them. Hold them in return for once. Decide who I am and quit letting you define me. I think I will be happier that way. I think maybe it is time to let my light shine. 
__label__label1 Well, hello. I am really not sure what to write about, I guess I can start with my day. You see, I am a commuter. I live in LOCNAME. No one in LOCNAME seems to know where that is but it is a little town on the other side of the airport. So, anyway, that means that I have the privilege of driving through morning traffic for an hour just to get to class, then what is even worse it that I get to drive back home through five o'clock traffic. It is a pain in the backside. I hate ORGNAME ORGNAME. On the up side, I was lucky enough to schedule all 00 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That helps because I am also a Parttime employee with fulltime hours at the only department store in LOCNAME. Three years ago the store opened meaning that PROPNAME now had a ORGNAME, ORGNAME, and ORGNAME. That is about it for stores. So, about my job, I am a Sales Associate. We recently switched new districts into the LOCNAME area. The District Manager is very strict on how the store is arranged. Last week, whoever did the schedule only scheduled me to work on Saturday for Five hours. You can not pay bills working at a minimum wage job for five hours a week. So I told my Store Manager that I would be more than happy to come in if she needed any help prior to PROPNAME (the District manager) coming in on that Friday. In the end I worked ten days in a row, pulling in forty hours before Friday when the District Manager was going to be in to audit. I was exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around. I was thankful that my Manager let me have Sunday off, I needed the rest. Today is my anniversary, I have been dating a guy for eight months now. This is probably of no concern to you but I am very proud of that fact. He goes to Incarnate Word in LOCNAME LOCNAME. He is an Eagle Scout and spends all summer teaching camp at Lost Pines Boy Scout Reservation. On weekends, he comes back to LOCNAME to ref. Soccer games at the BYSO Soccer fields. All this volunteering helped him when it came to my parents approval. You know, one time in my Drama Class, a friend of mine started to do just a stream of consciousness monologue. In the end he was talking about mixed drinks and jelly beans, it was very funny. I miss my Drama Class. Most of my high school stuff I had to give up due to the need to be able to afford college and get my degree. I had to quit dancing, I had danced for 00 years at a local studio. Then I had to give up ORGNAME ORGNAME, an organization that I was the captain of for all four years of High school. Most upsetting though was giving up Drama. If I was not in a play I always tried to contribute somehow. I single handedly costumed four productions in one year in my "spare time". Oh well, I guess that is it for mow. 
__label__label1 Isn't it amazing how lifting weights can make you so aware of your muscles? Every last inch of me is sore. I am such a weenie. Exercising is fun though. It helps me relieve stress. I'm already starting to feel a little stressed here. I wonder if I am an abnormally stressed person. What is a normal stress level? I'm having a hard time deciding which organizations to be in. I want to be in communication organizations to help me be prepared for my career but I also want to be involved in a Christian organization. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME sounds neat but it takes up a lot of time. I wish I were better at knowing what God wants me to do. I want to follow Him and to be patient but I also don't want to not be assertive and let opportunities slid past me. I feel like much of my life I have been too laid back, letting things come to me. I'm tired of being out to lunch. I want to prove to my dad and my brother that I can be responsible and detail minded. I want so badly to get a 0. 0 this semester. I feel so torn. Part of me says drive hard! Study hard! Don't let organizations take time away from academics! Prove you are worthy! But I know that I need to follow God and the He is what gives me value. I am probably making too big of a deal out of all of this. I think I'm just frustrated with mistakes I've made in the past. I need to let those go and not worry about what my dad and brother think. I know my dad has faith in me deep down. I just feel sad and I don't really know why. I just wish I had more direction but even as I type that I know I just need to listen to God. I guess that's the problem  I'm mad that I don't get a clear answer from God. It's so hard. I've never been totally sure of what God wanted for me. Well maybe that's not true, but I never hear his voice telling me what to do. I wasn't even sure if coming to LOCNAME was what He wanted. I saw lots of doors open up for ORGNAME and when I was expecting to see bad things about UT I found that it really wasn't that bad and the students were really friendly. Now I'm trying to figure out what decision to make about organizations and I'm secondguessing every phone call from members in the organizations and the gut feelings I have when I go to the meetings. I don't feel any strong direction and I'm mad, frustrated. There must be something I'm doing wrong. I want to be closer to God but every time I try I end up getting so confused and frustrated with Him and myself. Why does being on the verge of tears for a long time make you have a headache? Man I hate how my desk is set up. Gosh, I'm being so negative. I really hope my paper is the one out of 000 that y'all decide to read. This really isn't representative of what I am like. Tonight is just a bad night. God has given me so much yet I worry about so much. Like my business and professional speaking class. I don't like the idea of being graded on my performance. I know I won't make eye contact and make all sorts of other mistakes and get a bad grade. Wow! Listen to me. I'm going to be one of the people they call to do a study of depressed people with low selfesteem. I put on that questionnaire that I am generally happy and have a high selfesteem but that was last week. Tonight for the first time since moving down here I feel sad. I was so proud of myself for not freaking out and adjusting well. Maybe God is trying to show me that I really can't do this on my own. 
__label__label1 It's 000 now; I feel like I'm playing who wants to be a millionaire, waiting for the time to change. Yeah. Really that's what I just said. Why is my roommate talking to me? She knows I'm doing this assignment. Ahhhhhhhh. That was really annoying, I'm not sure if I just meant my roommate or me. I sometimes think I don't know the meaning of half of what I say (even though I didn't say that) I just completely lost track of what I was writing cause she talked to me again. Blah blah blah. Why do I do that? Anyway, I want to have more dreams. Really bad. Good dreams where I don't want to wake up; like the one I had when I was little and it was so cool there were these lonely French 00 year old kids in it and I was standing outside their house window or something; they remind me of mafia and the untouchables; my secret song that I swear is about the untouchables. I wish I knew what song it was. That would be great. I wonder if I'm making too much of my friend 'coming out'. Like I'm ok with it, and most everybody is ok with it, but I might be trying to sound TOO ok with it. I don't know. My roommate's parents don't like me, I don't think. But I'm not entirely sure so I shouldn't even think that, let alone say it. Or write it. Aren't I supposed to be typing about my feelings? Ok, I feel like I keep trying to prove myself to my friend PROPNAME, just cause she is so wonderful and I don't feel too wonderful myself a lot of the time. But I don't try to prove myself to her; I did to my friend PROPNAME, but not to PROPNAME. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I hate that; I'll think something about somebody just cause I had thought it about someone else. And I don't know if that's bad or good or whatever. I'm typing too much too fast; I keep getting myself confused and backspacing. I wonder if I should just leave all the misspellings in here; it might make sense so far as the paper goes, since maybe that would suggest that my mind's confused and jumbled, the way handwriting is supposed to tell about you, but I don't know at all. Cause we're supposed to correct our misspellings. The Buddy PROPNAME song is in my head. Does that mean I should sing it to the paper since it's in my head and whatever's in my head should be going down here? No, I don't think so; it's kind of like background music; jazz to PROPNAME type of thing. I wonder if I'm as important to PROPNAME as he is to me. That goes with all my friends. He should be here soon; no tape for me. This makes no sense, I'm sure; I sound horrible, like PROPNAME PROPNAME, except for I keep criticizing myself as PROPNAME keeps complimenting myself. My back hurts; I wonder if my doctor who I went to once was right when I said I was going to have neck and back problems later, just cause I don't have the greatest posture in the world. I mean, my philosophy professor said today that if pleasure is virtue then he was virtuous in smoking, and he wasn't lying, but I don't think that there is any virtue in slouching. Is this what fist person books are supposed to be like? Cause characters would never be able to write this much; no, what I meant was that it would sound dumb and pointless and rambling like this, unless they had some superb, LOCNAME island computer guy like mind. Like that last reference wouldn't make any sense at all to anyone but me; in books they describe it. I don't know. Like PROPNAME I guess. Bless you. There, I said it in response to my roommate's sneeze on here at least. I don't think of her as PROPNAME, cause she's not, she's my roommate. PROPNAME's a dead girl who used to laugh at a camping trip where she got sick on the day of a campout; no a bonfire; who used to like peanut butter. PROPNAME did, not the peanut butter. Why is everyone homesick (or my roommate). I'm not; I want to talk to my cat though. He's going to hate me when I get home. Like, it'll be like when my mom took him into surgery and he would run away from her. I hope he doesn't die. I'm missing all of the little things in between these thoughts; the thoughts I have while I'm typing. I would try to type those things too but then there would be things while I was typing that. I hate paper, I miss trees. There goes my roommate complaining again. But I'll stop, cause she might come over and read over my shoulder or something and I'll have to stop like I did the first time I tried to do this exercise; that was horrible, it was only 0 minutes into it, but still. But she came close to here, and I don't know. Good, she's on the phone now. I'm staring at the little monitor light on my computer; it looks like some alien symbol for sex or something; I don't know what I'm thinking (tip of the tongue) but its weird whatever it is. I want to be in Rocky Horror. I wonder what it's like to be in it; just in the movie, not the little plays during it. Yesssssssss, noooooooooooo. I don't know. It's 0:00. Why the hell did I type yessssssssss? Remember on the Wonder Years, and they would have to go to typing class; that's what I think my mom's childhood was like. My lips feel like they're about to fall apart if I smile again; not because I've been smiling too much, because they're really chapped along the edges. Two minutes left. Yess. I did it again. I want to go out to breakfast; real breakfast, with eggs and pancakes you don't have to tear apart with your teeth to cut. I'm looking at my chopsticks now; I wonder why people are so fascinated with them, why I brought them, I don't know at all. And I'm feeling bad about having a goodluck elephant made out of ivory, cause doesn't that go against the good luck of elephants? 
__label__label1 I've decided to write this stream of consciousness paper on laptop going home to LOCNAME. My brother was doing the driving so I decided to use my time wisely and write. Right now I feel relaxed going home. I still call LOCNAME my home, although for the second year in a row I've spent 0 months of the year in LOCNAME. I wonder if I'll ever call LOCNAME home. Maybe only if I live here when I'm more settled in my life. What's weird is that though I am going to college with a goal, and doing reasonably well and taking courses that I myself have chosen, I still can't but help feel at time that I'm not sure where I'm going. Or if I will reach these goals. I wonder if others feel the same way. I'm quite sure they do which is probably why when the weekend rolls around six packs are brought in. I, myself, have never drank, so maybe that's why I feel that I am taking the whole impact of this college thing, so much more than others. I kind of figured out why college students feel so pressured in college and I've came up with several reasons. First, you have to study like hell to do well. Second, sometimes you can study and not do as well as you expect. Third no folks around to cry on their shoulder and then you can't because you're a so called wuss if you do. Fourth there's no tangible evidence like money to make you feel like you're going to succeed. By the time a kid reaches college level he or she wants the financial freedom of an adult but knows it way down the road. Sometimes that road seems too foggy to see down. Finally if your a momma or daddy's boy you miss that home cooking. With all that dry and dull food and on top of that mounds of homework and hours of studying to do any right person would not call Austin their home. Not just yet. We all need a safe haven to go to. Mine is in LOCNAME. 
__label__label0 Well, I have just come back from a ORGNAME meeting, an organization I never thought have joining since it is for future health professionals. But after I finished talking to one of their alumni advisors, it seems certain there is stuff for a business major like me. Plus, a friend of mine is an officer. The only problem I've encountered is the interaction among new people or strangers. While at the meeting, I kind of shied away from interaction with these people but I could go up to a few people. such as the officers, and start a conversation. This has been my tragic flaw my entire life. I have this shyness and this fear of new interaction. I am quiet guy and just do not have that calm easy going matter to break the ice well. Part of the fear is embarrassing myself I suppose. Yes, sometimes I have had the guts to start conversations with new people or call up a girl and be spontaneous. Then, do I become relaxed, however, this courage seems to only come with an individual or a rather small group of maybe 000 people. The problem comes when I have to be exposed to a huge amount of people. I just get nervous and it happens all the time, the confidence just seems to die. I can get a few bursts of courage, but after a while I just give up. I keep telling myself that I have to just stay calm and be confident, but this trait of mine still keeps to be holding me down. Sometimes I even become too quiet and shy with my friends which is sad. That is why I feel reluctant at times to go to parties because of that loss of confidence to mingle and the quietness that weighs me down. But that is why I am hoping to be more active in student organizations this year and see if I can work to build this confidence to thwart off this nervousness of interacting with people. I feel I can do it, and although I may still be naturally shy, I will at least feel more confident in these situations. 
__label__label0 Right now I fell very discouraged about all this college business. Everything is going wrong. My computer keeps screwing up and I don't know how the hell to fix it. I want to go home where I know where things are. I wouldn't have a computer problem if I were home. I have barely any friends here and nothing ever to do but to watch TV even though there is never anything good on. I miss my girlfriend, I wish I was home. I'm sick, my throat hurts, I feel trapped, I have too much crap to know what to do with and there's no room for it. I hate college right now. I don't see why people like it or why they keep going. I think I made a mistake by coming here, nothing is going right. I can't even eat when I want, I have to wait until a certain time or walk 0 miles. I'm tired and need to study but really don't want to. Why am I the one who is always getting screwed over? I want to throw my brand new 0000 dollar computer out the window because it's a piece of crap. I'm not even sure I should be at college. I'm incredibly stupid, I don't see how I got accepted here. I have the worst memory in the world which should help me out a whole lot here. I'm hungry but oops, there's nowhere to get food. I feel like crying all day for so many reasons. I wish I could be happy like everyone else. I'm tired and am going to bed. 
__label__label1 Last night around 00pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. She told me that a guy I went to high school with had just committed suicide on Friday. Apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which I had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. No one knew where he was so they went looking for him. They found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). It still hasn't hit me yet. I have been at school with him since the first grade. I know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. After last year I thought everything was going to be better. At the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) PROPNAME committed suicide by hanging himself. After getting over that, PROPNAME was killed in a car accident. After coping with PROPNAME's death, I thought nothing else was going to happen. I mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. The rest of my year was going great until April. That was when I found out that one of the girls who I had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. She overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. I couldn't believe it. For years I would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. Going to her funeral was the hardest thing that I have EVER had to do. I cried the minute I got there and didn't stop crying until days later. Seeing her parents made it even harder. I mean what can you say to them. Nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. Nothing could make you feel any better either. She had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. I absolutely and completely fell apart. I couldn't see where I was going I was crying so hard. Even now as I am writing this assignment I'm getting tearyeyed. I still don't understand (and I probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. I mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. PROPNAME is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary/junior high school. Everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. Now I'm just wondering if the saying will come true. Will there be a third suicide or death that I'll have to deal with? I really and truly hope so. I sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. When I first started this assignment I didn't think that I'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. This is kind of therapeutic though. I'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so I've decided to start typing about something better. I really excited to be here at the university. I really love it here. My classes and professors are great. I am worried/anxious about final exams though, but I still have awhile before those come around. I'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. Unlike in elementary through high school in which every 0 weeks you got a progress report and then every 0 weeks came your report card. I'm also getting used to being alone a lot. Sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. But then again you meet so many new people. Well, my time's up. 
__label__label1 So here are twenty minutes of PROPNAME's thoughts. As I sit hereORGNAME I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I'm agnostic ORGNAME proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept PROPNAME PROPNAME will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has "faith" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. I've never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it's there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I'm dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I'm gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in LOCNAME) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to "recruit. " At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have PROPNAME PROPNAME in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of ORGNAME and ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will "choose" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per PROPNAME PROPNAME that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from PROPNAME's ultraliberal mind. 
__label__label1 Well, today was a bad day. Not bad in the sense that negative things happened, it just wasn't good. I talked to PROPNAME, the girl I really like, and it turns out she doesn't feel the same way. Earlier in the week (I hope PROPNAME isn't reading this) I had another girl come out and tell me she had feelings for me. I hope PROPNAME doesn't view me as I view the girl. She is nice, but I feel awkward. I don't know how to act or respond sometimes. Am I sending the wrong signal? Am I communicating poorly? Who knows? Certainly not me. So, that's that. PROPNAME Still really likes me as a friend, but nothing more. Kind of sucks. I wish I were more attractive. I think I got the bases covered on personality, just the physical appeal that is holding me back. I'm working at it. I am enrolled in intermediate racquetball and playing whenever I can. I'm up to two pullups. This is a big accomplishment. This summer, I started working out with my best Friend PROPNAME and then I could do any. Now two. I so excited. PROPNAME goes to ORGNAME. He was supposed to come here, with me, but decided that "pep" and "spirit" was his thing. I'm cool with that I guess, I just wish I wasn't stuck with the "potluck". Will, my roommate is all right and all, I just wish I could open up a little more than I do. He doesn't "get me" like another one of my good friends would. My best friend from high school, PROPNAME PROPNAME, will be coming up this weekend. I can't wait. I miss just hanging out with the crew. I like college and all, and I'm making the transition fine, I just miss the good ole days. I am coming to terms so much better than some I know. PROPNAME, the one who came forward to me about her feelings, is having a really ruff time. Apparently, whenever she tries to talk to her mom about it they get in a fight. So instead, the just avoids confrontation all together. Not a very wise approach if you ask me; and she did, and I told her. I like meeting new people. PROPNAME apparently doesn't. It's out of her comfort zone. Actually, that's how I met PROPNAME. She's so awesome. She into anime just like me, she draws, she's tall, and she just all around cool. Sadly, she does not share this sentiment to the extent of which I put forth. She thinks I'm hilarious and a great guy to hang out with, but she just doesn't like me like that. I should go on, get over her and whatnot. I cant. I've tried. I like her way too much. I will eventually though, or that is what I've been told by the ones I open up to here besides PROPNAME. PROPNAME is a great friend. She thought that I liked her at first, but then I started opening up to her about PROPNAME and she understood. She rooms with PROPNAME, whom I met at orientation. She had a thing for me too. I don't know, when I like them, I get turned down and away, but when I just think they are cool, I get asked out. Why can't things go my? Be different, somehow? This can't be fair. I try so hard to get what I want. It never just comes to me. Like now, in engineering, I have decided that I don't like engineering, but I'm stuck there for at least the semester. I enjoy PSY000 with PROPNAME. He's a character and the subject matter interests me. I would consider psych as a major, but that is my brothers field and I'm already too into his shadow. Oh well. We will see how things turn out. They usually do. For the better, or worse. what's the difference? I don't know. Could I even tell? If I follow that principle things would turn out regardless. good, or bad. Who cares? Well, I do. The future is uncertain and that is why it's scary. Whether or not this is actually read or just run through an analyzer, it has been a good place to vent. I look forward to the next installment in this tedious tale of love, trust, faith, and social bearings. Until the next time. =) 
__label__label1 . I never thought it would be this hard to think about my stream of consciousness. Now that I am aware that I am actually thinking to myself, it makes it really difficult to think normally. I keep giving myself all these weird things to write about but really none of them are really representational of the real way I think. My thoughts are usually random and irrelevant to anything going on around me. You could say I daydream often. I really wish that I were doing this in a quiet room because the things going on around me are effecting what I want to type about. PROPNAME, my roommate, is usually in the library so I guess I should have taken advantage of that earlier and done this assignment then. My attention span is short. I keep finding myself drawn into her conversation. It makes me think about talking to my friends on the phone, which eventually leads to me reminiscing about some past event involving my friends. The funny thing about my situation now, is that only actual people talking, interrupts my thought process. The television doesn't disturb me at all. I have gotten very good at tuning it out. Maybe its because I have made it a habit of doing just about everything with the television on, including sleeping. I am growing impatient with the time now. It seems like 00 minutes has gone by, but when I check my clock it always reads the same. Time always passes slowly when you grow anxious for a certain amount of it to pass. This assignment is difficult for me. I am really having trouble recording my natural thought process instead of just making these random thoughts up for the sake of using up my 00 minutes. I just keep looking around my room hoping that it will spark some thought and give me something more to write about instead of this meaningless rambling. I don't know, my mind is blank now; I am pretty much out of time, so I think I will end on this statement. 
__label__label0 I am really enjoying myself to a certain point here at LOCNAME. I already am homesick and miss my friends and family. I am having a tough time adjusting to life around here. I just got out of Biology class where my teacher barely speaks English. I know I don't like that class, and really dislike the teacher's methods of teaching. I just know I am really going to have to be on my toes in that class. I am meeting new people here which I hardly ever did back home. I still need to make more friends. I already have feelings of loneliness just because I don't have the support here that I do in LOCNAME. I hope that changes soon. My time at LOCNAME may change from four years to one semester if things do not start to look up. Everyone keeps telling me to stick it out and do my best, but I am not even sure I want to be here. Austin is nice, I know that. However, since I don't know anyone, LOCNAME is better to me. I know my way around there and have a car and know what things I can do around there as far as entertainment. It's a rough adjustment that I will have to deal with, either now or later. That is the only thing keeping me here. I did meet a girl down here that I knew back home but have no idea what to think about that at the moment. I'd like to think that means something, at least meeting her was a big step in branching out, I guess. I dislike my roommate. He spends every minute of life on his computer. He was up last night until 0:00AM while I am trying to sleep. Jester rooms stay pretty lit with one light on so it was hard to sleep. The guy is just hard to live with, yet he never talks unless I talk to him. His friends call the room all the time, including up to 0:00AM, and stop by the room at again 0:00AM. It ticks me off but what am I going to do? I talked to one of my friends back home last night. He has decided to go back to high school and try to finish. He should have graduated last year but dropped out twice in the same year. He has ruined his life with drugs, but at least he is trying to restart. Man twenty minutes is a long time to write As far as my classes go for college, I know I hate Biology. That is definitely my worst subject. I really don't know what to think about psychology. My grades were not that good in high school in psych but I still remember a little of what I was taught. Mythology looks like it could be fun but I have only been to class twice. I have my teaching class tonight so I'll see how that goes. As far as I know, there are few guys in the class. That could be good or bad. Well that's the end of twenty minutes so I'll see how the rest of this class is before I decide if I like it. I do like the writing assignments so far. Hopefully, that will continue. 
__label__label1 I'm really use to writing for long periods of time straight and not stop. I keep a little diary myself and write my thoughts and feelings down whenever they overwhelm me. I suppose it's some sort of stress release because I always feel better afterwards. Writing in my diary has allowed me to express my feelings and emotions onto paper. This way, it's easy for me to look at it and then maybe figure out how I am to deal with the emotions. Some things I write about are problems with my relationships with other people. One entry I wrote just recently was about a problem with this guy. There was just so much pressure on me from this guy that liked me that I couldn't really stand it anymore. He told me he liked me, and I suppose he expected me to just like him back. Don't get me wrong, he is a good friend of mine. Maybe that's why it was so hard. But anyways, I was able to express my contained feelings into my diary. It really did help a lot. When I first heard of this assignment on writing for 00 minutes straight without stopping I thought to myself "wow, this will be fun". My roommate, on the other hand groaned and said she would never be able to do something like that. She says there's just not that much to write about. I told her how she could just write bout her day or whatever. 00 minutes goes by pretty quickly if you think about it. It's already been about 0 minutes since I started. I'm typing kind of fast. I suppose it's the flow of the words. Since there's no really structure on this assignment, I can write without thinking too much. I had a pretty harsh day today. Didn't set my alarm clock, thus I woke up 00 minutes before my first class started. And my teacher Is a real stickler for this timing thing. She wants us in our seats and ready to go by the time class starts. That is usually what I would do, but today, I really couldn't do much about that. I hate walking into class late. There's only about 000 zillion people that look at you when you walk in. And you know what they're thinking, "man, SHE's late". I don't like that feeling. Well after the lecture (which I understood very well) I had to go back home because I hadn't brushed my teeth or anything yet. The whole way back I was thinking, "man. it's too early in the year to be starting this". But I got over it. Told my friends and laughed at it for a little bit. That's one of the reasons I love having my old friends here at LOCNAME. There's always someone there for you. It's like bringing a little bit of home with you. I live with one of my old friends from high school and she's an awesome roommate. Her boyfriend is also one of my good friends. And his roommate is the guy that I mentioned earlier. that likes me. Then I have many other old friends that are hear with me, and it just makes me feel more safe and comfortable. But I know I need to make other friends and I do. I like to just talk to people I don't know. You know that old rule "never talk to strangers?" Well, I don't follow that one too well. It's always nice to meet new people. They can always share new things with you that you couldn't get if you just stayed with your comfort zone. I like to venture out and make friends and do new things. People that don't like to do that, I feel, are too closed and unwilling to experiment and find out. It's scary being here. A brand new place with all these HUGE buildings towering above. Scattering around like ants looking for classes. In LOCNAME, we have big buildings and classes too, but, everything is so familiar there. I miss it, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere but here right now. I love the new atmosphere and environment UT provides. There are so many things to do. I'm enjoying it a lot. Maybe that's why I don't really feel a whole lot of stress with the new classes and deadlines and everything. I guess in happy here and that's what's most important to me. All the other things I can deal with as long as I'm feeling good. 
__label__label1 People laugh at the same things over and over. There doesn't seem to be any diminishing of reward. No matter how long a joke has been around, no matter how old the recipient is; the same things seem to make people laugh. Why is that? Maybe it's because we like hearing the same stories over and over, associating them with our memories. Like "Star Wars". Nobody today looks at Star wars and says, "man, check out those models! No strings? How did they do that?" or, "Man, that PROPNAME PROPNAME is a great actor!" But most of us can remember a time when we would have said that, so we just watch it over and over and over again. Nobody would do that with "PROPNAME's List". And the fact that Schindler is now IN Star Wars just mucks it all up. That's why everyone thinks Episode One sucks they're beyond the point where they want to see any more of that. The fact is that they're all fairly crappy, especially Return of the Jedi. Good god, was that awful! But people go back and say it was the best, because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids. Come on, "Care Bears" was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves. Why did we ever like that in the first place? Well, it was the 00's nothing else was on. How did the end of the 00's manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? Suddenly, everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science, or at least enough to talk about them, which was not at all. You barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something. I've seen "very intelligent" high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues. They bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument, like the bible. What the heck does PROPNAME have to do with campaign finance reform? All the people in the bible lived under a sovereign government they didn't even have elections! There weren't even ideas at the time to compare to these, because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the LOCNAME government, and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government. Since most of them got ripped off by being murdered, it's not like they can very well put forth a campaign. The ORGNAME had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didn't like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of 00. Might as well have been anarchy, but then again, you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart. Of course, we know how well that strategy worked, considering the glory of the current Roman LOCNAME. 
__label__label1 I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, LOCNAME was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. 
__label__label0 Right now I am not stressed and I feel very comfortable. However, I feel like I should be thinking of ways of obtaining a scholarship so I can help my parents out. I guess you can say that I feel kind of guilty. I mean putting two kids through college is no joke. I guess I have been pretty preoccupied with that during my entire stay at UTAustin. Overall I like the campus. Most of the parties and events that I want to attend are off campus, but that does not keep me from having fun. The people are generally nice here. That was really unexpected, because most of the people at my high school usually considered themselves superior to the rest of the people. I wouldn't say that my high school years were the best because it was not. However I think that I could have made it better. However, now that I am in college, I feel that I can start my life all over again. All those mistakes that I made in high school are gone and I can try to learn from them. (Such as waiting until the night before a major exam to study) I think that college will definitely teach me how to balance my time. I am glad that my parents decided not to let me work because I do not know how I could have adjusted. However I know that I will have to work at some time during the school year. Hopefully I will be able to handle it. I am pretty much worried about my classes and what grades I will get in them. So far it has not been so bad. I know that the worst is yet to come. Preparedness is not one of my stronger assets. I tend to be flustered and nervous most of the time. A young woman that I knew from high school told me that the important thing to do in college is not to stress. Hopefully I will live up to that. I can't promise anything. I still feel upset that I did not get any type of scholarship. I felt that I worked hard, but then again there are a lot of intelligent young people on this campus and not all of them obtained scholarships. So in other words, I don't feel as bad as I used to. 
__label__label1      Urg! There is sand in my sandal. It's been there for a while now.  It was so annoying that I had to take my shoes off while I was driving   home from my horrendously long art class today. I had to wait for   half an hour for that stupid bus. It was at least 0:00 by the time I   reached my stop. You'd think that rush hour would be over by then. It   wasn't. I sat in traffic from LOCNAME all the way out past the Y at 000.  That is just insane. I was stuck behind a maroon jeep cherokee with   a Gore/Liberman bumpersticker on it for most of the way. But that   guy exited when I got to the 000/Mopac split. Then I was confused as   a white Rav 0 started diving through lanes into spaces too absurd to   drive in. It was quite odd and annoying all at the same time. Then I   was almost cut off by a stupid woman in a red mini-van and her   punk looking son. I'll just say this: I was ready for this day to end at   about 0:00 this afternoon.  Now it's getting cold in here. My dad's office is always cold. Of   course, his computer is always on. It's a giant that's hardly ever   used. Shame really. So my feet are starting to get quite chilly. More   of the usual discomfort.   The smell in here is rather interesting. It smells like candy. Cherry   candy to be precise. For a moment I thought my boyfriend might be   eating some of the lollypops my dad always has on his desk. He   wasn't though. Odd. It's really not that usual for an automotive shop   office to be smelling like candy.  There are too many boxes at my feet. It's hard to get comfortable with   all of them at my feet. I keep mentioning my feet. Why is that? They're   uncomfortable, that could be one reason. I feel bad because I have been sort of brusque with my boyfriend.  Here he is, come all the way from across town just to see me and I   can't even spare him five minutes before I launch into my homework.  I think I'll give him a hug now. Just a minute. I think he appreciated   that. It was a necessary break in my stream of consciousness. He   gives so much of his time to me, the least I can do is give him some   back in return. Sometimes I wonder why he is so loyal. I tend to rush past him   when I'm doing something or I overlook him when he wants my   attention. He really dosen't deserve that. He's such a nice person. I   always tell him that I'm a mean person and that he would be better   off with someone prettier and nicer. He just smiles and hugs me   and tells me there is no one better. I have my doubts, but I really   don't think I'd give him up if someone better were to come along. I'd   fight to the death to keep him. That's how much I love him. I'm a very jealous person. I'm stingy with my boyfriend and I'm stingy   with my friends. I don't like anyone being around him (mostly   females) if I'm not there too. I know I shouldn't be so difficult, but it's   not really something I have any conscious control over. I don't like   my sister being around my friends either. I hate sharing friends with   her. She's younger than I am and she has her own friends to hang   out with. I don't bother her friends, why should she bother mine?  I'm beginning to wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over for   me to wash it. I've been needing to do laundry for a while now.  There's charcoal stains all over my shorts, and I've run out of spiffy t-  shirts to wear, so it's off to the wash. I don't know whether or not I'll   have time to do it all tomorrow as I had hoped. I also need to pay a   visit to my old high school tomorrow. I've promised my friend PROPNAME I   would visit. There's really only three teachers I want to see: Mr. PROPNAME   (physics), Mrs. PROPNAME (English, Creative Writing), and Mr. PROPNAME   (Newspaper). The trinity of great teachers. And with all great figures   there has to be a   devil  . Mine is Mr. PROPNAME, my art teacher for three   years. I looked up to him as a mentor and he turned his back on me   at the end of my senior year. I was crushed. Still I wonder if my   boyfriend brought his laundry over.  He's really not the most hygenic person in the whole world. I've had   friends tell me that he's lucky to have me because he's too   disgusting to date other women. I don't have a problem with him.  Sure he tends to go three or four days between showering, three or   four weeks between laundry cleanings, and three of four months   between room organizing, but I love him anyways. And besides, I've   been know to go a day or two or three between showers. All this   talking about him makes me want to hug him again. I think I will.  Once again, just a moment. okay, I'm done.  I keep hearing the sound of a little red desiel ORGNAME outside. There   are no windows in here, so I really can't see. Very strange indeed. My hands are starting to cramp. My wrists are aching and my   fingertips are numb. It's a leathal combination of the extremely   powerful air conditioner and all this typing. My hands are starting to   look cold too. When my hands are cold they get a little paler. Even a   little yellow. Did I mention that my neck hurts too? It does. My butt is   doing nicely, though. Must be this comfy chair. My dad bought it at   the ORGNAME ORGNAME  for his birthday. It's really nice.  Sometimes I wonder if I have a brain tumor. There are times when I   forget simple things, or I get simple things confused. I really hope I   don't have one. I'm planning to spend the rest of my life with my   boyfriend. I suppose I should really call him my fiancee. Yes, that   works. We're going to be married on February 0, 0000. It's going to   be marvelous. We're going to have platinum puzzle rings made for   our wedding bands. Why puzzle rings? Because we exchanged our   own special puzzle rings as marks of our engagements. I don't   know if I would call it official or not. We haven't formally announced it   to our parents. Mine already know I'm not leaving him. I half think my   mother wishes I would. My dad likes him, though. That's always a   good sign. There is a gigantic printer seated on the desk beside me. It's a   monstrous beast of a machine. It's actually a printer, fax, copier,   scanner all in one. Great piece of machinery, really.  I don't want to do the dishes that are waiting down at the house. I   had a long day filled with the joys of muenstral cramps, and I'm   really not up to the task. I hope someone does them before I finish   all this. I have five younger sisters, three of which are at the   dishwashing age. You'd think one of them would do them. Still, I   have an ominous feeling that I will be burdened with the chore as I   am burdened with so many other things. Sometimes I can't stand   my family. Fortunately, my step-mother is no longer part of that life. I should   really be calling her what she now is: my father's ex-wife. That fits so   much better. I'm just glad she's gone. Life would be much more   hectic with her still here. She's a bi-polar wrech who refuses to take   her pills. Did I mention that she cheated on my father when they   were married? One more reason for me to despise her. I despise   any person who cheats on their spouse or partner or whatever you   want to call the person you are in some way or another bonded to. It   may not be a happy bond, but theres nothing that excuses cheating   in my eyes. I will never cheat on my fiancee and I hope to God that   he never cheats on me. I would be crushed. I've been watching that timer like a hawk since I started. I'm so tired   of typing that it hurts. Literally. But with a minute and a half left, I must   press on. Ha! It's a pun and I didn't even realize it! I'm so clever.  Some would argue that point, but I still think I have my shining   moments. Everybody needs their shining moments. Without shining   moments, we're just dull. Afterall, what's the opposite of shiny? Dull.  I never want to be dull. I'm certain that people already find me dull,   but as long as I don't know about it, it's all good. I just hope they   never say it to my face. That would make me either sad or mad. I   guess it depends on the weather that day. But people who know me   don't think I'm dull. At least I hope not. I just don't like waiting all   afternoon for a bus that takes thirty minutes to run. And you can   quote me on that one. So there. Yep. 
__label__label1     hehe. . wow you do have a timer on this page, I heard that you didn't, or that you could write for like 00min and then just hit submit and it would work, and I thought to myself   wow. . how hard would it be to make a script to auto submit it after 00minutes are up    Its really lame tho that you didn't give us some sorta topic to start out on, I mean, I find it easier to conciously recognize my thoughts when they are focused on a general topic. That prolly doenst make alot of sence, but basically I'm a big person into mind over matter stuff, metaphysics, multideminsional self, acension, and usually and am in close contact with my thoughts, but usually when in a trance state or meditation, not while acually creating kenetic energy(moving physcially). I'm listening to my speakers right now. . I love tool's music, its so euphoric and conductive to a meditative state. sorta like how trance music sorta makes you tired after listening to it for 00 min or so. Yeah, now you prolly think something about trance == drugs or something. But no. I don't drink, do drugs, I'm a vegetarian, and like to keep my body in a good state. Wow my computer case is dirty. I need to get a towel or something and clean it off. I wish I had a new motherboard/processor and more ram for it too. Which reminds me I need to build a linux server soon. . I've got the parts just not the time becaues I'm too busy writing programs for my cs classes. Taking 00 hours is ok. wish I had more. . like 0-0 more. it keeps me busy, which I like. I want to do research in metaphysics. Isn't weird a cs/math double major wanting to do research in the area of metaphysics which has no real basis physically?  I got a good base in logic tho which really helps. My gf is coming up here this weekend, from dallas. Shes' at NT right now cause shes in tams and I miss her, it'll be fun. oww my hand hurts from typing or something. I like being able to close my eyes and just type it makes it easier to concentrate on my thoughts. I still taste the cheese on my tounge. I had cheese and crackers earlier and it was good. thirsty. . yay tea  I like my cell phone, I saw my cell and it made me think that. unlimited night/weekend is awesome. Music:   duh duh duh duh   end song move to bad religon. . ehh. . I guess it can sit there for now. hmm. . been 00min so far. about half done. I like this tho. well not so much the writing for stream of concouisness but the premiss behind it. analizing thoughts see what people are like and stuff. . its nice. thinking I would do a triple major in pphilosophy if I can get a job to pay for my classes that go over 000 hours. wow there is a big purple mark on my arm where I rest in on the edge of my   desk:    its not a real desk, more a shelf in my aparment designed to act as a desk. I like my apartment so much better than dorms,  room by myself, and cheaper. Got housemates tho. but its still better. I wonder what tristan is doing at college station (old roomate). I've lacked seeing him online. music  resist and multiply   . . thats incubus. there ok but latest album is the worst they've done. grr I need to do more streching, I've lost my flexiblity, and I need to work out more,  just got to make myself move awayt from my phone and just surfing online when nothing better to do. they have a gytm over here in my apartments. wonder where it is. I need to find out. mainly want to work on abs pecs and left trapiezius all but pecs aI can do here in my room with my dumbbell so not that big a rush  &lt;moving to music&gt;  &lt;singing in head to redhot chili pepper&gt; I like my speaker system. sound card and speakers where bout 00 total which is nice for how they work. . not top of the line but better than anything else I prolly could of got for the same. hmm. . my joints in my fingers like to pop, and my knees sometime. I'm siting weird, or what most people would consider weird. basically enjoying my flexibitliy and light weight so that I can stay in strange positions and be comfortable. I usta sleep in class in weird positions. . I had to fight to stay up in logic this morning. but I made it. . so yay. I watn a 0. 0 this sem so staying up is all good. I shoudl be able to cause I'm working harder than any time before. . hmm. . its ddone now. . bye bye 
__label__label0      I feel like I am under a lot ORGNAME stress right now at this time. All that I have been doing is wondering if I am going to make it through college alright. I am very hungry at this time. I do not know if I will get something to eat right after I am done with this assignment or if I will wait until I have done some other homework from another one of my classes. I know that I will have to get something very soon because I can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner. I smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until I give some food to it. I feel sort of tired at this point in the day. I have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon. That is sort of a good thing because I get a big break in the middle of the day, but I would rather get my school day over with early so that I could do homework at any time that I want to instead of being forced to do it right after class. The reason that I have a schedule that is this way is because I went to one of the last sessions of orientation and I did not get the times for the classes that I wanted. Right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because I am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break. Usually when I type I will take a lot of breaks and I will waste a lot of time that I should not be wasting. Therefore, I guess that this is a beneficial assignment because it is teaching me something that I am not used to doing. There are many assingments that I am not used to doing that I have had to do for all of my classes. I get a lot of math homework, which is something that is completely different from high school. Back in high school I really did not have that difficult of a time with the work that I was given. I feel now that I will have to work very hard to attain grades similar to my high school ones. The reason that I figure this is because I have talked to many people that used to go to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Some say it is not that hard, but the majority of the people that I talk to say that I will have to work my tail off if I want to be at the top. They have said that everyone is just as smart as me at this school. I feel that this fact is a good thing. I like to be challeged against others who are at the same level as me or above. I feel that if I work hard that I can do anything that my mind imagines. I think that all people should have that kind of confidence because everyone in this world is worth something. Maaaannnn, I am really really really hungry because that food smells really good. I think that I am going to go and get something to eat after I finsh this assignment. I may have a burger or a few tacos or something. Whatever I get to eat, I know that it will be delicious because my stomach is turning and wishing for something to be put in it right now. I forgot to tell myself that my left foot hurts a whole lot. Yesterday I dropped a big can on the top of my foot and it swelled up a little bit and it still kind of hurts when I walk for a long time on it. I know that if I just gave it a little time to rest that it would probably be fine, but I have an active life and I really cannot do that. 
__label__label1 I'm in my roomate's room right now, since my computer is not hooked up to the internet yet. I never realized how little she does. She has a piece of paper, apparently meant to be a homework assignment, but it's covered with the most random, 0st grade-type drawings I've ever seen. She obviously put a lot of effort into this. I guess she was trying to avoid doing her assignment. This room is a mess. I can't wait until my computer's working. I haven't checked my e-mail in a while. I guess I should do that, seeing as how I'm expecting scholarship information. I really need some more money, preferably free money. It'd be nice to not have to work for once in my life. Not like my parents help me. PROPNAME have better things to spend it on, like my spoiled-rotten older sister who can't fend for herself because she's never had to. I wish I could call Mom evry month and tell her how much money I'll be needing this month to survive. It's pretty ridiculoous when you have to give plasma for food. I need to just file for independence, I basically support myself anyways. I'm actually thinking about getting my wisdom teeth pulled at one of those labs that tests anesthetics on you. I'm supposed to pay for it myself, but how the hell am I going to afford that?  Rent's coming up and I haven't even received all my financial aid money yet. Oh, well. Maybe I can somehow either win the lotto or get discovered. I'm going to a modeling contest in a week. Hopefully thing will go well there. I really need to get out of LOCNAME. My boyfriend PROPNAME lives 0 hours away in west LOCNAME. He's supposed to start playing college football again in the Spring. There's going to be draft people there form the ORGNAME. That'd be pretty cool too, except that if he moved to a different state, he'd want me to go with him. I'm not sure I want to succeed in getting out of here through him. PROPNAME, my roommate, has some of my stuff in here. That kind of pisses me off. I don't take her shit. my other roommate PROPNAME owes me $00 dollars. I need it for my psychology book (ironic, isn't it?). I found out yesterday that he owes all his friends money, almost $0000 total. I don't think I'm going to be seeing that money anytime soon. I don't get payed for another week, and my job pays crap. I want to get a new job, one that actually pays me decently, but unfortunately, I love my shitty job. I graduate in 0 0/0 years if things go right. That is, if I can get into the Psychology Dept. (once again, ironic). Why is Psychology the only major in Lberal Arts that I actually have to apply for?  I could've have gotten in easily when I first applied for school if I had known what I wanted to do. Oh, well, not much I can do about it now. I've missed way too many classes already, and it's only the 0rd week. I've never been sick in my life, and now my immune system decides to go on a vacation. I wonder if my parents realize that I'm probably never going to talk to them again after I graduate?  I know if I mean that or not. Sometomes I think I do. I don't think soomeone going to school full-time should ever be burdened as much as I am by financial responsibilities. It's jsut not right when, according to everything I've applied for, they make too much money. 
__label__label0      Today was a very hot day, and I think because I wole up too late I never fully got into the flow of the day. But ohh well it is over now and this is the last requirement that I have. Once this is done I am home free and ready to begin the best portion of the week, the weekend. I am sitting in LOCNAME room writing this and I am smelling the cigarets and seeing the ashes that she has left in front of me. I think I really want to quit smoking also because I can feel how much it is taking its toll on my health. I think another reason why today was difficul to get through was because I am still very sore from rugby practice that was last night. Finally we are getting into the scrimaging and off of such concentration on the fundamentals of the game. There are only so many times that I can sit and do the same drills over and over. I really like being in this room, I think that it is because it is a away from my room and into a house where everyone who lives here I am friends with. So I always enjoy comming over here. This is actually kind of hard. I don't think that I will be able to continually write in a stream of conciousness for twenty minutes. But what the hell I am giving it my best shot. Now someone has walked in so I now have something else to tune out while I write this. Well I think that , actually I have no idea what I was about to say. Anyways looking around the room trying to find something to write about. Well I actually went to all of my classes today. And I have gone to them now for ywo straight days. It is kind of hard especually concidering that I have four classes on Monday Wendsday and Friday. Tuesdays and Thursdays off. I figured when  i signed up for these classes that It would be nice to have two days off a week but actually the whole plan kind of sucks. I never want to go through all four classes. I always want to leave early and really i always do. Then when you go home that night I always think that it is time to get real fucked u because there is no school for me tomorrow. Well that happens and before I know it the next day has come and half gone. Always it is about three o clock and I am staring practice in the face at six. Once that is over I want to go out agian but the problem is that I have homework in four classes that freally should be done before I go to the next class. And if you bow that off and decide not to do it and to just go out your problems just become exponentially worse the next day. Great isnt it. It was real brilliant thinking on my part. Next semester I am going to sign up for two hours a day everyday so it is nice and spread out. Red green blur pink orange white black purple white blue think don't stop this writing keep it continuous. It is going to be fun to learn what I am actually doing this for once I touch the button on the bootom of the screen to go to the next screen. I also hate the bus comming home. I have to wait for the city bus instead of a LOCNAME shuttle bus so I can be waiting for thirty minutes which is not fun at all. Then get on the bus. Airconditioning is nicve and cram yourself next to a lot of people that smell bad, I know I smell bad too but it sucks that wee even have to smell eachother. And the I want it to just take me to my stop, not stop at every bus stop along the way and let everyone else off. Is that selfish really who cares,  It was just today that triggered that becauser it took so long. One minute left I can keep this continuous keep writing, writninhgg. writing, anyways this has been just wonderful writing this. I hope that all o our assignments are this much fun. I have really gotten a lot oof thids 
__label__label0      I don't know what to write about right now. I guess i'll start by telling you how I feel right now. I've been a little depressed lately. Complicated stuff with my girlfriend. Well she's not really my girlfriend becuase she said we are only   dating   so it isn't as serious as going out. She's in PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME so she's been really busy with sorority stuff. I guess I just miss spending time with her. I also thought about joining Lamda because I couldn't hang out with her. Now I realize that would be a bad move becuase I need to concentrate on my classes. I am going to make an   A   in all of my classes. I need this 0. 0 to have a better chance getting into the Business school. My sister believes I can do this and I think that if I try really hard I will do it. Wow it's only been three mins and 00 seconds. This is harder than I thought. Hmm I don't know what else to say and I feel obligated to keep typing the entire twenty minutes. I just popped my knuckles and I know i should stop doing that because it's really bad for me. I'll prob end up having arthritis when I get old. I'll talk about my environment now. I'm in my friends room at LOCNAME LOCNAME. Room 000. There are four of them in this room. PROPNAME just said he hates working on Fridays. I would too, if i had a job =P. PROPNAME is sitting beside me and doing stuff on his computer. He said he needs to work on some website this weekend. PROPNAME is eating barbeque he got from Jester City Limits. He said the sauce is kind of spicy. They are watching ORGNAME ORGNAME right now. Now back to ORGNAME and LOCNAME is on. Damn she's hot =). PROPNAME is on his computer messing with some photoshop stuff. I don't know how to use photoshop. I just play games on my computer. Oh yeah, and sometimes do homework on it =P. wowowow, its only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. dang time is going by slowly. haha, now they are watching tennis. ok, nevermind they are just flipping through the channels. It smells really bad now, someone farted =PROPNAME PROPNAME said it wasn't him but i think it was. PROPNAME is getting me to write more. Now he's telling his brother that he was put on the second network. For some reason last night his uploads went crazy, which put him over the bandwidth limit. The second network doesn't seem that bad. All the webpages he went to opened quickly and stuff. PROPNAME needs a new computer. He's singing it to some song on mtv right now.   I need a new computer. mine's a piece of trash. whoaahh   haha weirdo right? =P  uhh ohh now everyone is humming/singing to the song!  oOoOo a girl is coming here right now, because it says on her away message that she is stopping by. dang it now its been 00 minutes 00 seconds. lalalalalala I miss PROPNAME =P this sucks. I was pretty sad last night because i started thinking about her again. Well atleast she goes to the same school. My friend PROPNAME goes here, and his girlfriend PROPNAME goes to . that girl is here now. oh yea jenny goes to UT arlington. PROPNAME smells like girly stuff, she smells good. She said girls fart and go number 0 just like guys. PROPNAME is going to try to transfer to LOCNAME next year. She's been more depressed than i have because she hates it there. She found jizz on her couch at her apartment and she was like what the hezzy. =\ oh yeah i left my phone in someone's car and haven't gott   its evolution baby!   - marco - weirdo. i haven't gotten my phone back yet. I went ALL day yesterday without my phone. I was a new experience. A bad one. jenny's instant messaging me right now. hmm 00 minutes and 00 seconds. almost done!  haha i guess thats what i'm suppose to be talking about right? what's going through my mind. caleb doesn't know what this is he asked me ahaha here ill start writing lyrics for   marco is stupid    haha he's watching so i had to write that. nevermind the song goes to fast, i cant' type the lyrics. woot! almost done less than 0 minutes left. i played volleyball last night for the first time in a couple years. there were some guys there that were really good, and i had this short girl on my team named isabel  and they spiked it at her really hard and she was like   ahhh   and got out of the way of the ball, it was funny. 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 haha i'm almost done woohoo. first writing assignment finished in 00 00 00 00 00 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 woot! 
__label__label1 tomorrow we're going to see carrie, i'm really excited, i think but then there's also being anxious about it. i know i should be happy and in many ways i am, it's just weird. because i mean things with lisa have been on the weird side lately adn i don't think it's going to get any easier. maybe it's only this period of transition. i'm glad that lisa's comign out of her shell, i guess i'm still not wanting to. but then thea'ts not really something i like doing. typing on the keyboards makes little to no sense. at least with eva's keyboard, it's letters are separated, i wonder how she writes like that. i hate my dingy old omsputer though its so crappy i wish i could get s\a new one, but theen it'd be bad wasting it on some money. i wonder who that professors in waking life was. matthew said he teaches at LOCNAME but i guess it'd be hard to find him. there are al million billion people on campus. which has been weird cause i've been seeing people that i didn't really think i'd see again. i don't quite know what to do about that. i wish that john and i were better friends so we could hang out somewhere away from here and everything in my life wouldn't be so complicated and connected for once. i wonder what he thingsk of me, i hope i'm not imposing too much, i gues its been a while since there has been someone that's really interested me and i wish i could make him be interestedd in me too. i think its that need for love that we all have that makes me get this way. i guess i'd feel much better if i had someone that could hold my hand and listen to everything. i wish on some level i could be taht way with matthew, but when i'm with him, its so much more different. oh god. i'm only been writing for 0 minutes? what am i supposeed to write about. i wonder if this will give me writer  s cramps. that carpal tunnel ? syndrome. i doubt it. but i don't know this is probly the most work i've had to do for a class so far. that and going to cnetral market, which wasn't too bad. i don't see all the glamour of central market yet, but who knows maybe it's there. i'm glad that i know some people in my classes, at least in my art related classes. theatre and psychology are other things. i wnat to be able to go up and talk to someone, but its so freaking intimidating. i think i'll make it a point next time to come early so i can get a good seat. i just wish i wasn't so tired all the time so i could really enjoy those classes. i thought i'd be spending alot more time being intellectually stimulated than i have been since classes startedd. maybe it just takes aw hile. i dunno, i still miss some aspects of high school. god, that sounds lame. and i know it is on most levels, i just miss how easy it was. but maybe not. the latter part of high school was hell. especially senior year. and really before senior year. i can't believe i still think about him sometimes. i must be liek the biggest loser in the world. i wonder if its because of him that i'm still get malfunctioney sometimes. but most days, i know for sure that's not true. maybe i just need someone or something to constantly be thinking about. like i need some drama in my life so i create it for myself by bringing up something that really bothered me even though its way in the past. i can't spend all this time and energy trying to analyze myself. it gets exhausting. i just should forget about it sometimes and just have funn. but then that gets you to be too so-called   shallor  . . that's really lame. i should just not be this way. i don't know. its not like i really think this way all the time. maybe i do but i guess it just seems different when actually writing out ideas as they come. i guess thats what i did with paper journal. thought i've become too lazy to keep up with one. i wonder how anna is doing. i'm glad she keeps in touch with carrie at least. in my aspect i totally understand why she wouldn't make too great of an effort to talk to me. god, i'm such an ass sometimes. hmm. . maybe i should eat ramen. it was so good today. but i dunno, that would mean i got to go work out or something and i know i'll regret it later. i'm tired of worrying about weight but then the flabbiness is not good to look at. i wonder how really obese peopel can live. i mean, not to be rude, but i feel really bad for them. if i were in their position and had trouble with just like moving around and stuff i might just die. aimee is going to sleep and this static crap is annoying the shit oputta me. i guess that's that whole buyy cheap. less quality thing. god but now its' like louder than ever. there headphones off muuuuuch better. my computer is so stupid. makes too much noise. i want to meet john someday. i hope he writes back soon. i guess i was kind of a big jerk for waiting so long to write to hiom. gosh, i hate that. it could have been fixed and we could be writing each other back and forth like we used to. . but noo. . i'm a big freaking idiot. ahh maybe i shouldn't try so hard. he's different than most guuys i know, i think. and i dunno, i really would like to see him one day. at least as friends, even though that might be kind of big and scary. maybe we'll just keep corresponding through email. that would be enough to keep me happy. i think. it's just weird giving so much of yourself so honestly and candidly and without prided or shame to someone you have never seen in real life. though, la 
__label__label1      This is the first writting assingment. I don't realy know what I am soposed to write about. I am also afraid that I will mispell a lot of words. I was talking with a friend on the way to class today. And we started to talk about this assingment. It made me kind of nervouse. But I guess he survived so I will too. I can't belive that only two minutes have passed. I guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers. And why they are so short. Some times I write a stream of consciousness down on paper. I think it is a good way to get my mind clear. If you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while. Then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something important that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it. I feel like   i should be talking about something more important. But I don't have anything important to talk about. My friend, The guy I mentioned earler, He said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about. I think that was probably a good idea. I kind of wish I did that. I feel like I am running out of things to say. So I guess that I will talk about what I see hear smell. Well I am in my room. I see the wall in fromt of me. I hear the computer game my room-mate is playing. He always plays a computer game. Always. but he is a real good guy. The computer game he is playing is some shoot um'up game. You run around with a gun ald kill people, Sleep with one eye open you say right? No its cool. Well I hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground, I guess because he can multi-task I hear music. he plays music movies and this game all at the same time. 00 Min!!! I don't like the song that just came on. What I see I see pictures on my wall. One is with my friend PROPNAME, We were at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We were in her cabin before the campers came. She had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin, that light up and have a siren when you push the button. So we were running around camp with them on our heads. It was kind of fun. I have know PROPNAME for a long time. We grew up togther. We went to camp togther and youth group conventions. She is realy up beat and friendly. Camp is a great place. I went there when I was a kid, And now I have been staff the past three summers. It is real wierd to see these kids come back evry summer and be a year older. They are so different. They were adorable or obnoxiouse. and now they change or are still the exact same way. You remember when the dident have braces. And now they are getting them off. I remember  when I had breaces. I hated them. But I only had them for one year. I had friends who had them for a long time. Four more mineuts. I realy can't spell and I wish I could. I am at a loss again. My desk is made out of wood. But it is not real wood. It is composit. It is a good desk it does waht it need to. My phone just rang. My room-mate just picked it up becaise I am on the computer with you. It is my friend PROPNAME she  was calling me back. I called her before I started writing. We were soposed to go to the gym. But I think she is there now. Ohh well. So maby abeer jon and I will got down to th  
__label__label0      College? I wonder how it will be? I just started it. It seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but I wonder is it something I will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         This is my first time living away from home and the ones I love and care about it. I feel the necessity to show to my peers that I'm not scared and do not miss home. But in fact i miss my home and my sister who I fought with all times. I don't know why I feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. I can't understand that part of my mind. Is it because I want to fit in the croud? Is it because I want to show others that I'm strong?           On the other hand - I love what I have been experiencing for the past week. I have experienced things I have never before. I never had to do mylaundry myself and now I do that and I find that I like doing it. I have to go to eat myself. At home the plate was always on the dinner. I feel as if I was spoiled at home and that I was given too much. Here I realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. And that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  I have learnt to handle things on my own. At home, if i met someone I didnt like, it was as if  I ignored them but here I realized that it is difficult to ignore 00000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . So far I can say that college has taught me more than I thought it would.          College is not the only thing on my mind. I think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? How will I manage to survive financially? If I will make a good living in the future? I question myself why I think so much about the future and so little about the present. I give undue importance to the future and not to the present. My thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. Things done turn out the way i want them to. I end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          But thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. I question myself if I really do believe in God. My faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. Losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but I coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. But when I lost when my father, I really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person I was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. I decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. But when i lost her at the age of 00, I thought forget God. He doesnt exist. However looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in God. I wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        I used to always think about eating food. But since the past year that it had changed. But i'm back to the way i was. I wonder if I'm a emotional eater? When i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. However when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. I would love to visit a shrink to get to know if I'm a emotional eater.

I hope I can get another job offer since I want to go camping on the 00th-00th & my training for the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is o nthe 00th. . man I don't want to tell everyone to go sat night & tude on sunday because we already talked about going friday afternoon. . of course even going friday afternoon they have to wait on me to get outta class at like 0 I believe but still. . tehy'd hafta wait til I got out at 0 pm on saturday if I did get a job at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. I need some kind of job so maybe I should just go to the interview & try to get the job. . it won't be that big of deal if we wait til sat & I could even meet them up there if it's a problem. . . I want to work at Urban Outfitters though because I coudl get discounts on cool clothes & room accessories & it's closer & prolley less demanding that working as an usher. . Of course being an usher would be cool because of free concerts & stuff but at the same time I wouldn't be able to sit w/friends or anything at those concerts but it's ok. . . & starting rate for the ORGNAME is $0 which is more than I was making at ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. I think any job would pay me more than ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . except of course LOCNAME but that's not a real job. . . Man 00 minutes is a long time. . Tru LIes was a good movie last night. . Ultimate frisbee was fun once half the guys left. . . I had no clue what was going on when there was 0 on each team but when it was 0 on each team I got better because there was less going on. . plus the guys had no choice but to throw it to me. . . There were only 0 of us. . we won though & I scored a point & assisted the winning point for our team so they couldn't have been that disappointed to have the girl on their team. . . I can't wait for the Two Towers to come out this winter. I'm so mad that PROPNAME lost that book! PROPNAME PROPNAME 0 will be very good too & I know PROPNAME is like counting down the days. . I can't believe PROPNAME' mom. . PROPNAME & I will always be friends despite the fact that I'm in college. PROPNAME is gonn agraduate & come here anyways. . I need PROPNAME to make me laugh. PROPNAME is my giudence counselor friend & PROPNAME is my fellow geeky to laugh w/friend. . you need both kinds & I'm glad I have both kinds. . even though PROPNAME has headaches all the time which aren't her fault. . I feel sorry for her but at the same time, she's a wimp. . & her many boy problems & many boys starring her down do get annoying. . that was so funny when PROPNAME noticed that after being w/her for like 00 minutes. of course she wAS TALKIGN a lot more than she normally does that night after working first night  at  ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . I was excited the first night PROPNAME talked to me too. the boy is gorgeous! Too bad he had a girlfriend. . not that that would mean we would've hooked up or anything. . just would have been nice to know he was available. I am drawing a blank on what to write now. . this fan kleeps blowing my hair & it's annoying me but I know this room gets hot when you sleep so I'll leave it on for PROPNAME. . i NEED to put a tack in the bottom of that paper there because that thing kept me up for like an hour last night. . I was so tired last night. I can't believe it took me so long to fall asleep. maybe I'll just take PROPNAME's idea & take a nap for a bit before my scuba class. this scuba class better be good because I really wanted to take a karate class or a self-defense class. not for the actual use of self-defense like the wussy girls taking that class. . I want to know that I can kick someone's ass if need may be. . I think I could put up a pretty damn good fight if I really did get mad enough. . even my play punches are hard acording to others. . that makes me feel like a butch girl though so I don't appriciate it when I am told that. Use those arms   Ugh! I shoulda stopped! Oh well! & the phone is ringing but she's asleep so she won't answer & there will be a message & that stupid machine beeps until you check it-good no message. . 
__label__label1      I want some ice cream. I will go get some as soon as I finish typing this. I wonder is someone is reading this because otherwise how can the computer analyze this?  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. too much studying to do. Maybe I should have done this on Friday morning. Oh well, I procrastinate too much so maybe this is a good thing. Gosh twenty minutes is a long time, especially when you are waiting to go get ice cream!  I'm not even hungry, but I haven't had ice cream is so long. Why do the guy floors in this building keep serenading?  Seems kind of odd that guys would do that for strangers. I like my room. It's very colorful, but I would still like to add more decorations. Perhaps more butterflies because it is a unique touch. Gosh, only a quarter done. I want my ice cream!!! Aww I can hear people yelling. how annoying. I would study in the library, but it seems kind of scary. This morning was scary. Yeah, I am never going to run by myself anywhere at 0:00 in the morning. I don't know if I want to make LOCNAME Crew or not. It seems really cool and I got a rush just from exercising this morning, but on the other hand, it is also tiring, expensive, and I have to go through the trouble of finding a ride every day so I won't have to walk all the way to First Street again. Hmmm, I'm having trouble thinking of stuff. Oh I did not like today's   quote of the day  . It had something to do with God making the LOCNAME round. I wanted to erase it, but I figured that might be a little rude. The sign should say   PROPNAME's quote of the day   since I don't really care and I don't choose which ones go up there. I should have a   Drawing of the day   or something silly like that. Yeah, maybe of the week so I won't have to do so much. I prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. Man sometimes I am so evil, but deep down I believe I am good. Oh my goodness, I am only halfway done. Do I have to keep writing like this?  I'm not sure if I really think about stuff this often. I may be just searching for topics to write about. Kind of like small talk, which by the way I cannot stand, partially because I am no good at it. I can't wait until this weekend's field trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME!  I havent been on a field trip since like elementary school. Well, on a good field trip. Maybe that's because there is nowhere interesting to go in Texas, er LOCNAME. This weekend is going to be so much fun, hopefully. I like a lot of the Women in Natural Sciences girls. A couple of the white girls seem kind of cocky though. Like my next door neighbor. She is never smiling, and she only comes over to talk if she wants something, such as markers. She came over the other day to ask for markers because she didn't want to use her sharpies because she said they would run out. Um, okay. so it's okay if other people's stuff runs out? Geez, and I see her talking to the professors alot trying to suck up. She annoys me already. Whoohoo only a minute and a half left! That's really what I'm thinking. Also I want to play ping pong downstairs with PROPNAME and ORGNAME, but I probably don't have time because I procrastinated this weekend. Dang it. okay I will just wait for the time to run out. 00. 0. 0. 0. 0. . 0. . 0. 0. 0. 0. yay 
__label__label1 i can't believe what i just did i wrote my thoughts all in that process of   stream of consciousness   and realized i didnt' put my social security number or name. it got sent though, so i don't know what to do now. all these problems are so fixable and avoidable. just in case i'm going to do it all again anyway. i guess i'll just type what i wrote last time unless i have a big interrupting thought.     it worries me that i don't know where i'm going in life. when i get an idea i start doubting myself an thinking i'm not competent. friends seems msasrter than me. am i just too analytical or self conscious to break out of my shell? i need to eat i'm so hungry and i have to go to rowing meeting in an hour. am i capable of going to medical school?  can i openmy own practice someday? will myrace hold me back? is it an advantage or disadvantage? both? whycan't i look like everyone else? i'm different. i wish i was unque. i'm a walking contradiction. one day i want to be different the other i just want to be like everyone else. i mean i where GAP like evvvvery day and that's the most mainstream you can get. i miss thomas. i miss the way he always made me feel like a good person. i loved him. now i love him more like as a friend but i definitely miss the fun times we've had. i wish i had a boyfriend like him again. excpet a bit different for variety. i hate angela. best friends since 0th grade and look what she did to me. she hurt me sooooo much. she punched me over and over. and i knew i could kick her puny ass but i loved her too much. now i look back and wish i never even associated with her. she's such a punk. i bet she'd like me more now if she saw me. now i'm more liek her. more bitter, more volitle. did i spell that right?  i miss her though. we had good times. church camp. haha, imagine her at camp now. she'd set us all on fire instead. it's only been six minutes and it feels like an hour. i can't believe i did this assignment wrong. it's not one of those things you put in the right answers because if that's the case, i wouldn't have to wait a whole 00 minutes. i like this assignment though. psychology is the first class that didn't put me to sleep. i'm glad. it's going to be my major probably. except those dumb blondes kept commenting and chatting about everything. so annoying. for the past few minutes all i've been doing is bitching and moaning about how awful i feel and how awful life is to me. you'd never know i was considered freakin' beautiful, popular, social, likable, homecoming princess, varsity athlete since frosh year. damn, i really had this act going strong. what's with christina aguilera trying to act all ghetto now?  she's freakin blonde blue eyed little shrimp with a big voice. don't let your careeer go down the ghetto tube like freakin sleazy mariah carey! is she still in the hospital? poor thing to think about, she's so pretty and got such a wonderful voice, but ever since she split from tommy mattola she got yucky. celine dion is so tantelizing. is that the right way to use that word?  i used to be so religious andf now i'm not at all. damn school course religion and philosophy. now i'm lost man. lost as a freakin fish in a bowl of nothingness. haha, am i getting bad and poetic?  i wish i had a way with words like some gifted talented folks. i wonder if i'd be this unhappy if i lived in oregon still. i miss oregon. i don't miss the bullshit with that crowd but i miss certain things about it. i hope dad gets a raise soon because he deserves one. i hope diana finds what she's looking for. she said she's depressed. PROPNAME thinks she's bi. mom said she wants to kill herself. this 0 minutes is going to go sloooow i'm telling you. people aren't as friendly here. liz is so perfect, funny that she's so down on herself. she's a perfectionist that's why. she became anorexic. she stopped getting her period, her skin got bad, and she became socially inept all the sudden. she is another one of those people who are surrounded by people but might feel very alone. i heard that psychologists have a problem stemming in their own life and to help other people is a subconcious way of letting that go. i believe it because i'm like that.  i want to help people feel good, i want to listen to them. i'm one of those people who constantly remind themselves to ask about how the other person's day was since i find myself focusing on myself too much. i ask questions that i want asked of me. that's so selfish. ok i think i'm nearly done, but this is taking so long. ahhhh. . PROPNAME, left the   group  . good thing too. but she's hanging out with the wrong crowd again i think. matt marino is such a pothead. i wish he was here too so that we can hangout. i want a car. i want that white jeep back. i wish i had a sweet car, a cell, and computer. a fully-paid tuition grant whatever. i need it. there's so many people that don't but oh well. i think that's all. 
__label__label0      well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at ORGNAME's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 0 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a HOSA meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend PROPNAME at ORGNAME ORGNAME. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and iM guessing its most probably Amit because it said   unknown   for the caller ID which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. Also i am really use to pushing   Ctrl S   and i can't really do that here because i am not  writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 00% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 0 minutes. i thought because of what PROPNAME said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 0 o' clock today. Once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like   awwww I Love You   in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and PROPNAME called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone!  Well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a Greyhound ticket to ORGNAME costs since i would love to go there. Well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my MIS homework, chek the emails from ORGNAME, check out the Sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some Eco, go over Eco notes, read some Philosophy, and the Philosophy book, read the beginning of the Psychology book, and finish Chapter 0 of MIS, and finish reading Developing You Into Me of Ba000. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 0 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. Besides all that, PROPNAME, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 0 playing for free at the Union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is Friday and now the phone just rang and now 00 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later 
__label__label0      ever since my boyfriend got this new job as a community assistant in an apartment complex, it doesn't seem like he has any time left over to spend with me. also, since he is a higher rank in rotc, he is even busier. so i question. what's going to happen to us? i ask him over and over again and he just gets upset. what am i supposed to think? every time this happens, we end up in an argument and threaten to break up which really hurts. i mean, he can't play with my emotions like that. it's not fair that he can have me waiting for him and giving up all my other plans in the hope that maybe this time, he'll come see me or make plans with never happens. it's not fair how he can just have me on the side when it's convenient to him. why is is that he seems like a totally different person now. not the same from the guy that i met more than a year ago. how can someone just change overnight? i am upset that when he does come and see me, it's is timed cause he says he's trying to squeeze me into his busy schedule. it make me feel like i am in prison and getting visitation rights or something. relationships shouldn't be like that. it was never like that in the begining. but he says he's a different person now. he just called right now and hung up on me because i told him i couldn't talk cause i was doing this thing for the psychology class. he's mad. but what am i supposed to do? after all, the reason i am here, is to go to school and learn and stuff. if he expects me to understand everything he does why can't he understand that i need to do this thing.  i feel like i'm gaining a little bit of weight and that bothers me a lot. yet, i'm too stubborn to get into a diet and too lazy to go excercise at the gym.  i am sooooo stresed out. not just from the crap i have to put up with my boyfriend but also because of school work and the crap i have to put up to with work. work does not seem fun anymore. it was in the begining when i first started working there for more than a year ago. maybe because it was my very first job and i was getting paid more that i thought i would be. or maybe it was cause i'm new in town and was meeting lots of people then who are my age. but now, it seems like work is just a drag. maybe i'm jealous cause my boyfriend has this wonderful job or may be it's cause a lot of the people and managers that i started working with left to another state or for another occupation and just wanted to get away. i need the money that is why i am still working there. i applied at the hospital a couple of weeks ago but they haven't called me back or anything. then last week, i decided i wanted to volunteer at the children's hospital and when i called to inquire about it to see what i got to do, they told me that they were good. they were good? how can that be. they're a hospital. i thought they always needed help. and i was going to do some services for free. it's not like i was going to ask pay or anything. it was going to be free. my boyfriend's roomate's mom works there and the roomate had told me that he was going to ask his mom to give me a job and he did and she said that all i needed was to give her the hours that i can work. i mean, i can do that but it would be really awkward in my position because the mom is my boyfriends ex mom. i just didn't want to be in that position you know? and i really need to start working in the nursing field and get out of being a cashier at heb because that's my major, nursing. that's another thing i was worried about. what if i don't get accepted to nursing school next semester? then what am i going to do? maybe i can switch to pharmacy just like what my friend did. but i don't think it will be any easier or anything. it was funny because one of my friends from my apartment complex is also a pharmacy major and was sucking up really bad to his pharmacy teacher so he 
__label__label1 Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now ì have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the ORGNAME,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 0:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially PROPNAME, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to LOCNAME. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 0 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 00, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! PROPNAME the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 0:00, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 00, 0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,          
__label__label0      When is this college life going to get any better. I have been promised a vehicle by my father after i get my license, maybe things will get better. I always thought that college was lots of crazy teenagers doing what they do best, going to partys. Sixth street was fun last saturday, maybe i'll do that again. But i miss the summer where going out and having fun was no big deal. In LOCNAME drinking is part of the lifestyle, no matter what age you are. Every summer since I was 00 i would go out. And even living in LOCNAME LOCNAME last year, I would make it to LOCNAME LOCNAME on saturdays and they didn't care in the City. Here things are strict, really strict. Not only do i want to go back to LOCNAME, i also miss my family. I hated LOCNAME last year and couldn'twait to come here and now i'm leaving next friday to go visit my brothers in the Northeast. Its all a big mess. I really don't know what to think. Maybe when I pick up the ORGNAME next week my life will become a lot easier. Atleast I will have a car to get around in. The only good thing in my life right now in LOCNAME ids the fact that my roommate is one of my best friends from high school. We chill all the time and thats makes things easier. This is all I think about these days. LOCNAME LOCNAME, my family, my classes, and now my new car. That dps booklet for studying the texas road rules is long and tedious. I don't think i'll ever pass with those crazy questions. It really isn't that hard. I need to stop intimidating myself because its not that hard. Maybe when i get my car i can drive to caly where Guy lives and chill with him. Its been a year since i have seen that bastard. that would be cool since i love the ORGNAME A0. The interior is amazing and the car drives really nice. jUst the leather makes it comfortable to sit in and the stereo system is unbeleavable. The only thing in my way is that stupid driving license. When i get my actual picture i. d. and some insurance i'll be chillin. Maybe I could drive to miami during thanksgiving instead of caly. There i could visit PROPNAME and go to south beach everynight, where they also don't care if your under 00. The Beach was amazing last year. when we used to fly down from jersey into LOCNAME we used to have the time of our life. Things will get better soon, i hope. 
__label__label1      I really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. It's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so I guess there is not much we can do about it. When i listen to music, I like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but I parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. I also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. Music helps me go to sleep also. I can never really fall asleep to it, but I will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. Speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. I've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. Why is that? Usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, I also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. I still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that I know they are ok, makes me feel better. Even if I keep going back to the same part of the dream I try my best to get them out of danger. I have a very strong family background. When I was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect  family and that nothing could ever go wrong. I always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. Their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. One of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. I don't think I could handle my mother calling me a name like that. I think I have a very good relationship with my mother but I know that I don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. I've noticed that I have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. I guess that is because I'm afraid to trust one person so much, but I don't think that is a bad thing. I just think that I'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. I guess that is because in junior high I had a group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what I do. Not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. I've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. I work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me. 
__label__label0   Well, I think that I need to practice working on my team games more. My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. PROPNAME usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, PROPNAME makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at LOCNAME. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or LOCNAME or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from LOCNAME or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW 
__label__label0  I hope I'm doing this right because I'm not sure. I feel so tired and I have so many things to do in such short time. I wonder if I'll pass all my classes. I'm afraid that I won't make A's and not make it into Medical school. I can imagine how my dad's sisters will laugh at him and tell him that they knew I wasn't going to make it. I feel lost, depressed, and anxious. Who should I talk to, well mayb nobody because what if people think I'm crazy or stupid or something. Everyone else seems relaxed and having a great time. I can't even walk out of my room because I either have homework or some quiz to study. I can't believe I froze today on my quiz and miss two simple questions. What's wrong with me? I used to take pressure fine now I feel like some crazy person. I miss PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He understands me. The good thing is that he's coming down and if my dad brings my truck up here, I can go and pick him up at the airport. I want to bring him back to LOCNAME and show him around. It's going to be nice to walk with him down the Drag and just showing him the campus. I can't wait to see him. I hope everything goes well since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth. I don't want anything to happen to him while he's flying over here. If anything happens to him, I'll feel terrible because I'm the only reason he's coming down. I hope I can have a good weekend with him. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. But with my parents, God, I can imagine them. They take things so seriously. I wish they weren't so strict and understand that me and PROPNAME are serious about each other. I guess that's why I'm so shy. I could never go out or do anything. Now I can't keep a conversation with anyone because I think that they don't like me but oh, well I don't need them. I have such a headache. It's just all these thoughts I have in my head. I wonder who's going to read this. They're going to think I'm some kind of psycho, however you spell that. Life is so crazy for me. I can never relax or kick back. I hope to God that in the end this will pay off. I wish I was already in med school but hey it all takes time. Now I understand what Dr. PROPNAME said. That man is so brillant. I hope to be just like him. He does surgeries like nothing. And to think that he didn't make it to med school here in the LOCNAME and had to go to LOCNAME. If he didn't make it with straight a's here at LOCNAME, what makes me think that I will. What did I get myself into? But this is my dream and I'm afraid to disappoint my family. I've always told them I was going to be a Doctor and if I don't they're going to ask me why, some will laugh at me, others will disapprove of me like Mr. PROPNAME, others will rub it in my face. How embarrassing? Agh! I even got voted most successful in high school. I can imagine everyone talking about me and how I thought I was so smart. If only they knew I had to work really hard for my grades. I was just like them. I want my mom to be proud of me and I want her to know that when she's old I'll take good care of her. I don't want to see her working hard anymore. Well this felt a little better taking everything out but now I feel like crying. Maybe that will help as well.    
__label__label0      So I started my college life about two weeks ago. It has all gone pretty much as to what I had expected it to be like. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME which is an off campus dorm and I have met tons of new people. I live with four girls whom I didnt know when I first started school. Some older people at the ORGNAME set us up. I really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. We get to experience our new life together. We get along great and do everything together. I am also really enjoying the fact that I get to make all my decisions on my own. Not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. I mean I don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work I have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. I have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. I have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. With homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. My roomate and I have had grown very close over the past two weeks. We have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. We realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. I feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. We both experienced ORGNAME ORGNAME together. We both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. We accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. I feel at home whenever I am at the house. Each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 00 of the new pledges. I am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. Other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. I am taking 0 classes which comes out to 00 hours. I chose the classes that I wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. The work load started off fine and I think that I am going to be able to handle everything. I was a little nervous at first about the large classes because I came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 00-00 people. My classes at LOCNAME on the other hand were quite large. I didnt know if I was going to be able to concentrate during a lecture if there were on average 000-000 people in the classes. As soon as one day passed I knew it wouldnt be a problem as long as I got to class early so that I would have a decent seat and be able to listen as closly as I could. As these last two weeks have flown by I have realized differnt tecniques to make the rest of my experiences at LOCNAME even better. I have learned from my mistakes and I have gained from my experiences.                       
__label__label1      So, i'm like, I have NO idea what to write in a stream of consciousness for 00 consecutive minutes. So, I guess, I'll just start off with a recap of the week. Nothing. You've got these 00 minute classes (woo-hoo), then a whole day afterwards to blow. That goes on for a few more days, then. Hey hey!  A three day weekend. Blah, like I really have much of a life to actually spend those 0 days having much fun. But, it was a break, nonetheless. The last break I'll ever see in my given lifetime. Well, I headed home. That was the plan. Head home, leech off the folks one last time for a while, then I'd get back to my   studying  . Well, suffice to say, I'm back, and I guess you could genuinely call this   studying  . &lt;Changing mp0&gt;    same auld lang syne  . What an awesome slow song. Mellow. Sad. Right, so. I'm boring you. A computer. A simple man-made machine apt in dealing with 00% of my socializing. THANK YOU AIM. I've got stupid art history to read up for. Thirty something pages I do believe. God, I hate being sick. Just my brilliant luck, I get home, and the sniffles begin. Then a drippy nose. Then the stoppage. Ugh, PROPNAME is my new best friend. This song is making me sad. i got to sne0eze. *whew*  Violent. Gosh, I hope i can succeed in college. Off to a pretty bad start. Me, uncertain of what major I'd stay in. Writer's block sets in, here. The song's almost over. Hehe, It's kind of funny to think about. Ever since I got here, all i did was sit in front of this computer and downloaded away at my heart's content. I got movies, I got PROPNAME PROPNAME (the beloved japanese anime), and i got music. Did you know my music collection is about 0 Gigs right now?  I've got another gig stored away on CD. Hah, I'm such a loser. My self-defeatist attitude can't be good for me, but it helps me get a laugh. You know, it really pisses me off when people have no sense of humor. &lt;song change, brb&gt;  Another slow, mellow piece, by PROPNAME PROPNAME. He's an awesome pianist. I like to play the piano alot. When *secretly* i do it to please people. ORGNAME. My (un-)superior piano skills gets all the chicks. Don't i wish. It's not like I'm that good either. I had what, 0 years of classical training (which by the ways sounds pretty good on a transcript), but it's not like the teacher was all that great. Grr, I really hated her. She made piano the mainstay of what I should be doing. She really didn't care if I intonated that I had some project due the next day. I had to sit through stupid hour-long lessions, only to come home all feeling defeated. God. It's not like I ever really   practiced   either :). I lied a bunch when filling out practice charts. It's like:   Oh, yeah. I really DID play those 00 minutes every day.   What total BS :). Oh, Am I supposed to curse?  Can I curse?  I swear to myself everyday not to do it, but it's really starting to creep into my vocabulary. hah, I've been typing so long, and constant, I bet my roommate is wondering   What on EARTH could this guy be typing for that long anyways?    Hehe, oh well, he's cool, not much to worry about. Man, I was worried all weekend that strangers I didn't know would pervade through the room and take my stuff. I'm paranoid that way you know?  Some unfortunate event from the past always haunts me. Stupid burglars. They stole my stuff. I've been scared since. That's a story I tell everyone. Man, I have some major psychological problems. Hope this class sheds some light. You know, ever since I took Psych in senior year, I've had this very strong fascination towards this field. Heck, if I stayed on this course, I could become a doctor!  Study interesting stuff, AND get lots o MONEY!  But, I guess, I shouldn't let my ambitions get too far ahead of other pressing matters. Sixteen minutes and 00 seconds past. This assignment goes by pretty quick. This is really fun. You know, sometimes I really DO do this. Sit down, and just talk and rant about nothing for an extended period of time. It's fun. it's enlightening. Sometimes it's downright hilarious the things i write down. Hmm, I wish I were funnier. My friend PROPNAME has the best wit you'll ever see. Awesome with satire and sarcasm, he's the best guy to turn to for a laugh. Hah, just thinking about our antics I crack a smile. Oh boy!  an IM message. Too bad I can't answer it. Ok, well, i'll take a peek. Hey, we're playing basketball at gregory. I'm still feeling sick. I wonder if it's wise or not. I could just walk on the track some. I really don't feel like running around, aggrivating my sore throat. Ok, ten seconds left. Make the most of it. Hah, cya later.     Sweeeeet!  I can still write after the 0o minutes. But I guess that they'll only grade the first part. Ahh, this assignment has really brightened my day. Fun as heck. Well, I'm out. Later. 
__label__label0      here we go. i don't think my typing can keep up with my thoughts. the palm reader said a few weeks ago, that i was very mentally busy. anyways, this red hot chili peppers is pretty good, although i don't like that cabron song. i wonder if you get penalized for not writing as much. should just take the easy way out and claim i am a slow typer. so this is what college is like. doesn't seem so bad right now. i heard the first year was easy. this class could be a little tough, but the professor seems to know what he is doing. i wish i could type without making mistakes. that would be cool. i wonder if lisa will call me today. we seemed to really hit it off the other day, and she does seem interested. i wonder if that is just her personality to be really nice or what. hard to tell if she has a lot of other guy friends or not. my roommate got back quickly from houston already. kind of pathetic only going for one night to see his girlfriend. i don't know why that makes me upset, i guess because she is still is high school and he talks like a moron when he calls her on the phone. back to lisa as usual. i can't believe she likes all the same music as me. i wish there were some concerts coming up this month to go to. i don't know what there is to do for a date without a car. especially since we are not the party types. twenty minutes is ridiculous. it has only been 0 right now, and i am spent. oh well, glad to get this done with. i have a feeling the studying and assignments and what not are going to be piling up soon. is that how you spell piling? doesn't really look right, but whatever. i'm kind of curious what the next page says about what i have writen. i should finish my reading today, that should only take a little while. here comes my favorite song on the cd. i wonder if they will release it to the radio. i bet the next page says something about if you don't capitalize your words correctly, you are this type of person. this email writing and aol instant messenger has left me with some bad habits. oh well, no big deal. i don't really the red hot chili peppers that much. kind of too much funk in their music for me. it sounds good, but their lyrics are a little shaky. i'm really glad i got these headphones though. i hope calculus tests aren't that hard. the ta seems really nice, and hopefully he will know what is going to be on the test. i still don't think the teacher knows what he is doing. we're up to  00 minutes. not bad. lisa. can't believe how this is working out. i wish i remembered more about her from elementary school. i'm kind of worried about her being smarter than me. it shouldn't be a problem, i guess i'm not used to it. makes me think i have to act smarter around her. not smarter but smart. she doesn't get in to that intellectual stuff that much. kind of crazy, i think about this girl like i have known her for a long time, and also that we are dating. i think what i said constitutes as a date proposal. we'll see pretty soon i guess. i don't like how i say i guess all the time. it's in my im's all the time. got to mix it up a little bit. 0 more minutes to go. i wonder how long the average one of these is. 000 kids in one class is huge. there were at least 0 people from my high school in there. god this is getting lame. the writing lady went to northwestern. kind of cool my best friend is going there for journalism. much better than arizona state or wherever economics lady is from. wonder where pennebaker went to school. can't tell from looking at him, had to be in the east though. probably isn't the best plan to do this while listening to music. kind of affects your thoughts alot. especially rhcp, they say some messed up stuff. the new cd is good though. they have kind of mellowed out. i wonder if i will see them when they tour. kind of an expensive ticket. but it would be cool to say that i've seen them. well looks like we are ending   
__label__label1 I just came back to my dorm from Hobby Lobby. I went there with my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME to get crafts and other supplies for our Nothing Books. Nothing Books are like scrapbooks, and we have to make them for our sorority, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I think it's a really cute way ORGNAME making sure we remember our pledge term. Rush week was maybe the most hectic week of my entire life. First of all, we got to LOCNAME on move-in day, and we spent all day, I mean all day long moving into ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was crazy! We took a break to eORGNAME lunch, but the day was insane. Everyone moving in with their boxes and crates, and the move-in equipment that was supplied was hardly efficient. So that night, we started rush, after all that mess. I was so tired and worn out, I could barely walk to the meeting. The rest of that night is kind of a blur; I think I came back to Towers after the meeting and went straight to bed. The rest of the week we had to dress up. The events got more and more dressy each day, and I could swear that the weather got hotter and hotter each day. I think I probably sweat more in those 0 days than I ever have. ever! It was honestly just gross. Really, the whole process of Sorority Rush at this university is ridiculous. I guess I am being a hypocrite, but when you think about it, some sororities will cut you without even getting to know you at all. You think they like you, and they're cheering in your face like they love you, saying all kinds of things, like   we hope to see you tomorrow  , and the next thing you know, they've cut you. I guess I am making it sound like it's an awful experience, when in reality it really wasn't so bad. There were some very entertaining events during rush. My favorite was probably Skit Night, where we were allowed to go back to a maximum of five houses, and at each house they performed their own unique skit to try to get us to come back to their house the next night for Pref Night. Pref Night was probably the most emotional night of the whole week. All of the seniors in the sororities were crying, either because they were excited to get new members the next day, or because they were sad to be leaving. It could have been a combination of both. Immediately after we went to our last three houses that night, we were on complete   silence  . We could not speak to anyone, not our friends, our families, not even people that weren't rushing. It was supposed to be our chance to think about the entire week and to make a decision based on only our personal feelings as to which sorority we wanted to be in. We went back to our group meeting areas for the last time, and we ranked our choices. It was not very hard for me, because I pretty much knew which one I wanted to be in. However, there were tons of girls crying that night, torn over what they should do. I am just glad I was not in that position. That next day was Bid Day, where everyone found out what sorority they actually got into. There was even more crying that day. All around me, girls were screaming and crying, because some of them hadn't gotten into their first choice sorority, and some were just so happy with their bids that they couldn't contain themselves I guess. It was crazy! I was very happy, and when I got out of the building and saw that all of my friends had also been put into my sorority, I was even more ecstatic. Our pledge class is made up of 00 diverse girls who each contribute something different to the sorority. I know I am going to love being in LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. What I don't know is how I am ever going to balance being in a sorority, making good grades in my ORGNAME, Chemistry, Psychology, and Hebrew classes, and partying at this extremely social school. Not to say that I am a real party girl, but I like to go to all the events, and it gets very difficult to stay on track with everything coming at you from different directions all at once. I am glad that I live at Towers with almost all of my friends, because it gives me a chance to not only be with all of them, but also to meet new people. I didn't know my roommate before I came here, and I have met so many people on my hall, or at different sorority and fraternity parties. I like everyone I meet, but I guess at a school with 00,000 students you can't go wrong. I know I made the right choice by going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. It has everything I could want in a college and more. I love it here!! And I especially love my styrofoam orange longhorn ears that I got at the co-op when I was visiting during orientation. 
__label__label0      For some reason, I have been feeling really tired lately. I have been getting plenty of sleep, but it's been hard falling asleep. It feels like there have been a million random thoughts running through my head recently. I haven't been able to understand many of them, or why I think them in the first place. Sometimes, I feel like I have ADD. Ever since I stopped smoking marijuana, my grades haven't been what I expect of myself and my motivation just has not been there for anything. My mom persistently assures me that I don't have it, but I just want to get tested so I know. Before I moved off to college, I couldn't stand being at my house for more than an hour at a time. But now, I want to be there all the time, even though I can't. I know that many kids feel   depressed   right after they move off to college, but I don't feel like anyone is going through what I am. I never understand myself. One minute I miss my ex-girlfriend. I was the one that broke up with her, but why do I miss her so much?  I went home last weekend, an I ran into her. Right after I left, I understood why I broke up with her, but I am already back to thinking why I broke up with her. I don't always understand her either. Sometimes I feel that it's her clinical depression that makes her that way, but other times I feel like it was always me. I remember hearing the phrase, there's someone for everyone. Well if that's true, who's my someone?  I hate waiting around and I just want someone that I can count on being there. I guess that's why I decided to break up with her in the first place. I never felt that I could count on her always being there for me. My dad told me that my grandfather was an alcoholic, so does that mean that there is a good chance that I will be one too?  I wish things were the way they were before last summer, when I had a girlfriend and had my friends that were there for me. I understand that college is all about experiencing new things and meeting new people, but I really haven't had the urge to do either of the two. Maybe this is just a   phase   that everyone goes through. I hope so. I have had no will to meet any new girls, which I expected the complete opposite before leaving. If I miss my home and my parents so much, then why do I never have the will to call them and just talk?  Why can I not just gain a little weight? No matter how much I eat, I can't gain a pound. I know these are supposed to be the best 0 years of my life, so when do I start counting?  I love math and everything, but it just seems like there is something out there that I would rather be doing instead of Mechanical Engineering. 
__label__label0      Today has been such a long day. I thought it would never end. Right now i am really energetic. Im watching tv right now. IM listening to the music video by Styles. It is awesome. i just finished submitting my cal homework. im glad that it is over. My roommate is playing different songs on his guitar. I look outside my window and all i see is darkness. i see the lights around the stadium, since i live near it. when it is game day, i can hear the roar of the crowd in my room. i finally received my poster that i have been waiting for. it is a scarface poster with the quote,   say hello to my little friend.   i smell chocolate and soap in my room. its probably because i just had a protein shake and just washed the cup. i wonder whats going on at my home in LOCNAME. i wonder what my friends are doing. i have to drive home tomorrow. i hate driving long distances. but then again, i will have my sister in the car, so i guess it ok. im really thristy for some cold water. i hear the music video by michelle branch. i want to watch the movie scarface right now. i love to watch that movie. it is the greatest movie ever made. i wonder if i should do the frat thing. i think i would really enjoy it. i just wonder what the pledge process would be like. oh well, i pretty sure i can handle it. i met so many people this past weekend. i had so much fun going out and hanging out with my friends. i just heard my roommate say that he thinks he should me a singer. i think thats pretty weird. he can't sing at all. he sounds like finger nails scrapping a chalkboard. i have an itch right now. my roommate is over here complaining about his homework. he says he doesnt get the formulas. hes  doing the frat thing this semester. his pledge process has already started.  i think he is going to have a lot of fun. i wish i could type better. i need to figure out cal. im doing ok in the class, but i want to do better. i need to by some milk when i get back from LOCNAME. im so sore from working out. i can tell that i won't be able to walk in the morning.  i need to take out the trash. it doesnt smell or anything, i just want to take it out before it does start to smell. i need to sign up for a tutor for cal class. i think i will be able to do a lot better when i get one. i need to get a new cell phone. im not getting real good service right now, but then again its prolly because im always in a building on campus. i never really understood the levis commmercial where he dumps a car into the ocean but then swims back down to get a book. i also need to fill the water. i love the brita filter. man i need to go to bed soon. it kind of cool how people are able to tell so much about a person from what they write. i need to start working again. i want to get my job at best buy again. i had so much 
__label__label1      I somtimes worry that my life is just some meaninless collection of random accidents culmintating in a demise that will be unremembered. thoughtout human history we have constantly tried to leave behind something that represents our existence. for example you have the great prymids of gisa where all the old pharros are barried. you have all the wonders of the wolrd that also represent the same thing. Another way that people leave things behind in the form of their children. I guess that having a child is one of the other things that i am worried about. I just hope that when I have one I can do enough so that they will grow up to be a great person. I did not really have a father when i was young because my real one left me when I was very young. I had a step-father so I supose that I sort of have an idea what its like to have a real dad. I don't know if me and my stepdad get along well enought sometimes, I mean its not like I hate him or dislike him or anything but sometimes its just like he gets on my nerves. My mom says that a son haveing problems with a father is akin to a daughter having problems with the mother, its some wierd behavior pattern or something that trys to get the child to strike out on its own or became the alpha male/female something. I have always been very interested in martial arts, I don't know hwat it is about it that draws me to it. Its just that when I see these small guys break 00 flamming bricks I feel inspired, its like if I could do something like braking 00 flamming bricks that  I could do anything. Its like a martial artists have somehow trancended human limitations and have becomesomthing else. Its like that whole uberman thing that neiche talks about. I wonder if the statement about power corrupting is always true. Can you ake a decent person a corrupt them with power and completly change their entire outlook on life. I think that there are some people that even if given absolute power would not use it and would serve as a benevolent ruler. Just yesterday I was playing a game called ORGNAME ORGNAME and at ther very end you had the choice of merging with a super-inteligent computer and ruling the world, killing the current tyrant and ruling the world behind the scenes as a memeber of a secret organization called the illumiti, or blowing up this one building that you were in and completly destroy the wolrds global network which would reduce the world to a isoltated city state type  environment. I did all three endings but non of them really struck a cord in me as being the correct action. 
__label__label0      Boredom, music, bump my air conditioner makes a really funny sound the whole time. so glad my parents got me in the castillian. dip, dip cup, i hope someone drinks out of the dip cup someday.

Frontier! i wish i could go back there, i wish i had stuck with being a   good kid   nicks phone. gosh cobys phone is so annoying, i leave my phone on vibrate, my phone is so crappy. I hate it, at least i got a cool blue strap on it. calculus, jeez i got to do more homework in that class, this sucks. im glad my weekend started early, but fridays are so boring, at least i got a lot accomplished today. dip, spit. i need to take this out pretty soon, i wonder if the timer will get mad if i go away for like thirty seconds, i wonder if there is a minimum on this writing assignment, i wonder what other people are writing, i wonder who is reading this? i wonder if anyone is reading this, tv is on, weather channel. i think a tropical storm is hitting friendswood, man i miss home. PROPNAME, best flood ever. so much fun, i miss my old friends back home, its like a whole new thing here, its so different. i miss jimmys garage, security, so much better than here. Castillian is great, the cops in fwood. jeez i hated the cops in friendswood, i can't believe they would just walk in so many times. im glad i left because of that, i wonder if they will still remember all of us when we come back. money, man my parents are great, tropical storm. I hope it isnt so bad, my house doesnt normally flood, i doubt it will, coby is home, bitching about class, thats funny. he didnt know where his class was, hes talkin to nick, why are they still watching the weather channel. their room is so messy, i wonder if grammar and spelling and punctuation counts on this assignment, i hope not. i wonder if this all makes sense. dip, spit. repetition, i wonder what that means, sixteen minutes, wonder why i spelled sixteen that time, i am not very good at typing on this keyboard, i miss my old keyboard back at home. I miss home a lot, i miss having the upstairs all to myself, i wonder what my sisters are doin right now. coby is looking for me. they are still watching weather channel. just read allison at the top of this, best flood ever. I can't believe chad wussed out and wouldnt swim down the street with us, I wonder how mike is doin, i hope he does well in football, I wonder what virginia is like, i wonder what it would be like to go to school all by yourself, im glad i don't have to. should i proofread this? i don't think  i will have time, 00 minutes. found the numbers that time. two more minutes, jeez i typed so much in such a short time, this felt like no time at all. dip, spit. whit, sarah. oh jeez, what trouble is that going to get me in. all that trouble is back home. last night, laundry, talkin on the phone, worst conversation ever. i can't believe i said some of that stuff, i wonder what susan is doin tonight, i hope we can go party with her and her sorority, i hope we show those girls a good time tonight. someone is lookin at away messages, we are all so addicted to instant messenger. everyone is, its horrible. nick mustve had a funny away message, people sent him  a bunch of messages, i should change mine. what is that music, some theme song?  
__label__label0      I thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. Actually, I kind of like it. It's kind of like writing a diary or journal. I feel hungry right now and am wondering what I am going to eat for lunch. I am tired of eating the same food at Jester again. The food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. I can't wait until I go home to LOCNAME this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. I miss my mom's cooking. Just a few more hours and I'll be on my way back to LOCNAME. I can't wait!  I miss my boyfriend so much. His birthday's coming up and I still need to get him a present. I don't know what to get him. It's hard for me because I don't have a car at LOCNAME. I wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. My friend just burned a new DJ cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. I miss my family. Its funny how when I'm at home I wish that I was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when I'm actually away I wish I was home. My roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. He calls her a lot. It's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  He would call me all the time. My friends are studying in my dorm right now. I feel so lazy. I'm behind in a lot of classes and I havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. I need to push myself to study before I screw up my ORGNAME again. Speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and I wish that it would over. I mean I like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. I just hate classes and studying. My friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. Its so funny. By the way the DJ cd that we burned is called DJ Prada G. It's like the DJ is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. Hmmm. Twenty minutes sure is going by slow. I have an ortho appointment this Monday so I'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because I can borrow the notes from my friend. I need to go shopping this weekend; I am so out of clothes to wear. Five more minutes. This assignment isn't too bad. When are we going to eat?  I need to start packing. I am such a procrastinator, I wait till the last minute for everything. I need to stop that. I wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. I have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. We are about to leave for LOCNAME soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. When are we going to eat?   
__label__label1      My roommate is throwing gummy bears at me. My favorite flavor is the pineapple ones. My roommate is rambling. Pineapples make me think of he beach. The LOCNAME. White sand, clear water. I am thirsty. I don't drink enough water during the day. I hear slaming doors, faint radio tunes threw the walls. My window is huge and the view is of a tree. I hear water flowing. My feet are cold. They are always cold. The enter key keeps getting stuck on the keyboard. I need to grease it I guess. I hate greasy fried foods. Dinner tonight was not to great in LOCNAME. I hear a cell phone ringing. I wish I had more minutes on my cell phone. I see the room phone ringing now. The door just opened. Tulips are my favorite flower. They only grow during certain seasons. I with I had tulips. They don't last as long as roses or carnations. PROPNAME O's flower is a carnation. Carnations are funeral flowers. Why does it always rain at funerals. I haven't been to a funeral in several years. I can't spell. The shift key keeps getting stuck too. I hope I get to be on the Diamonds. I need to apply. I miss PROPNAME. He is coming soon. I hope he gets here early. I wonder how PROPNAME did on her interview. I am sure she was fantastic. I hope she liked LOCNAME better. I hear cars outside. My feet are freezing. I have socks on. my socks are dirty. There are grammer mistakes in this writing. I hope I get to go to church Sunday. I miss my old church. I need to pray more. Man Im glad we are still friends. The game is going to be fun. Do i need to get there early. I wonder where my cousin lives. I wonder what he would have cooked for us. What ever it was, I'm sure it would have been better than what I ate. I can't believe he called me. When will I go home. When will I find a place i like to study. When will this place feel homey. I need to cut my nails. It is hard to type. I need a pedicure too. Ther're my favorite. I like the chairs you sit in. They put me to sleep. I never know how much to tip the woman that works on my nails. My back doesn't hurt. I can't believe it. This chair is hard. I liked stud    
__label__label1       I am so glad that I am finished with that stupid test for psy. Now when I finish this I can take a nap. I need to do laundry and get ready for tonight. I need to get the money that PROPNAME and PROPNAME owe me to do the laundry. I am not sure what I am going to wear tonight. I am tired. I hope that we get tickets to the OU football game, I really don't want to go stand in line and wait though. I hope that PROPNAME and PROPNAME will not be mad because I didn't get the tickets. I like Adam a lot. He is a really cool guy and I am really glad that we are friends. I like to have close guy friends. PROPNAME is cool too. although I have to admit that I found him attractive at first. He isn't hot or anything, but it is something about his personality. I know that he has a girlfriend, but I have PROPNAME too. I love PROPNAME and I wouldn't mess anything up with him for PROPNAME. I don't like him that much. My arms really hurt from being on the computer so much. My whole body hurts from exersizing so much latly. I want to loose weight so badly. I wonder how this will be graded, I don't suppose that there is a right or wrong answer, but what if I am writing about the wrong thing. I think I over think things. I wish PROPNAME was here. You know I think that, but I am really not sure if he was here I would like it. I mean there is a certian degree of independence without anyone here. I think that everyone follows their path diferently than others.  I mean PROPNAME is getting married. I know that I don't want to get married, but do I really want to stay with PROPNAME forever. I think so, but it just baffles me how I know that circumstances were different with me then I would be in a sorority and would go out and party a lot. Maybe it is good for me to not to have some of the luxuries that others have and it will let me make better decisions. I just don't understand why money makes a person. Maybe this is really steriotipical, but I think if you have money you can do a lot of the things that poorer people couldn't do. That sucks. I thought that all people are equal and God gave us all differnt abilities and in the end we are not all alike, but rich in differnt areas of our life. The more that I think about it though I am not sure that is the case. I mean maybe it is true and life isn't fair!  That would suck too by the way. I personally think that some of my frinds grew up better that me and therefore they will turn out better than me. PROPNAME is very introverted and wants to go home. that is one thing that I have over her. I don't want to go back to LOCNAME. I see PROPNAME as a second chance for me and I will break out of the social barrier that I had at home. I mean don't get me wrong, I had good parents that loved me and always gave me the best they could, but my mom wasn't as involved as others were and I think that hurt me socially in highschool. I wasn't in the popular crowd and I am not sure if I want to be. 
__label__label0 Thins are so different. THere are so many people everywhere. I knew that 00000 people went to this school but i did not realize the implications of having to walk around on campus with every single on of them. I was way excited to move to LOCNAME, I mean. I came from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss my friends, I miss the parties, I miss 'drive-bys' and TJs and the movies. I miss Twister and Busdriver and Presidents and Assholes. I got in the hugest fight with my best friend in the entire world. It just seems to me like there are some things that just shouldnt be said. You say things in confidence and expect them to remain in confidence. I only told her because I felt obligated because shes my best friend. its the kind of thing you're supposed to tell a best friend. I never imagined in a thousand years that it would get to everybody and their dog in less than a day. She has never betrayed me like that before. I wonder why she did now. I want to leave this room, but everybody is out. in class or at some meeting or something. I've adjusted much better than I thought I would. Maybe because I was prepared to move on. I miss my friends, but all of us realize that the past was in the past. althought its going to be a helluva party come Homecoming. Thats another thing. I miss my dad, the funny man, the journalist who used words like helluva in his articles. I should miss my mom, I think, but I miss my dad more. quite a bit more. I guess because he never failed me. Aw and my dogs. PROPNAME is so adorable, hes probably lost without me. Man, I can just imagine how pathetic that sounds. 0th Street! A whole bunch of us are going to 0th street tomorrow night. I have no idea what to wear. PROPNAME all worried about what I wear. hey, he's in LOCNAME LOCNAME, theres no way he can tell me what to wear. not that i really let him before. hes just not here to watch over me and other guys anymore. Anyway. off to 0th street. I love 0th street. I could just stand there and look at people for hours. People crack me up. We took a picture with PROPNAME the transvestite the last time we were there. My dad loved it, he'd actually heard of PROPNAME, the mayoral candidate. I think I got lucky as far as roommates go. Man, my friend ( you know, the one who betrayed me) got the roommate from hell. They go to ORGNAME, and this girl is so rich. The only problem is that she knows it;  I have never seen a more overbearing, holier than thou attitude. I told her I went to ORGNAME and she goes ''Ugh, public schools  . I just about smacked her. I guess the only reason I didnt was because I didnt want to make things awkward for PROPNAME. even if she has gone and made things awkward for me. I think its funny how everyone at first sticks to their own gender. All the girls sit with girls and all the guys sit with guys. I love the girls I've met here, but i think its high time i meet some guys. Im sure PROPNAME would love that. Hes not my boyfriend, though. As my roommate PROPNAME puts it, he's my   significant other  , whatever that means. We really need to go grocery shopping, but both of our cars are in the middle of nowhere (aka. . the other side of hell. I00). It is such a hassle to get to our cars. I think we'd both just as soon starve. As soon as I can get PROPNAME up here, hes taking us shopping. At least he's good for something. I don't think I've ever been so tired in my life. I think its because my sleeping schedule is so irregular. I'll sleep 0 or 0 hours one night and 0 the next. And weekends. man, forget it. Im lucky if I get any sleep at all. Im trying to make the transition with people. You know, that transition between just sitting next to each other in class to hanging out outside of class. Its a little rougher than Id planned. Im just kind of shy, I guess. I have a problem just asking them to hang out. kind of weird. I sat by this incredibly weird guy today in class. He noticed the strangest things about people. He wanted to exchange numbers and such to get up a study group, but we both forgot by the end of class. I can't decide if thats a good thing or not. seems like he would get kind of annoying after a certain amount of time. Oh. . I need to get my printer hooked up. There are so many computer literate guy geniuses I live with that I could ask. cuz I think Im missing some part or something. That doesnt really make any sense because its a brand new printer in a brand new box. What are the chances of my box being the one missing a part? How depressing would that be? Thats just an extra hassle that I don't need. Everything around here is computerized anyway. one of these days Im going to have to print something. Might as well take advantage of these computer geniuses. Ok, watching the clock. . yep.     
__label__label0      Man, what am I going to type about for 00 minutes. I need to do this in order to get credit. I wonder what the other writing assingments are going to be like. This song is good. Why do people like to fake tan?  Isn't that unhealthy?  This song is old school. I love it. I wish the longhorns were playing football this weekend. At least there are some good games between LOCNAME and LOCNAME, and Between Oklahome and LOCNAME. Damn I hate the sooners. They are jerks. Those guys at the cotton bowl last year were asses. I hope the 'horns' beat the crap out of them. I can't type today. i need to go to the SI sesion today to see whats going on in psychology. I should also look for a song to play before class. I love it when teachers put music on, or just simply do something out of the ordinary. It helps to remind students that the teacher is somewhat human. I hate it when teachers are very friendly or exciting. I wonder why teachers even bother to teach if they don't look like they enjoy it. Crap I can't type well at all today. Allright, new song. to slow. there we go. Good ol' Green Day. Damn they put on a great show this summer. It had to be the best concert I have seen. Blink 000 could have done better but their sound sucked bad. You couldn't understand them half the time. I wonder why the heck that is?  They headlined the tour and they have millions of dollars. you would think they could have a good sound to them. I wonder if there are any good concerts coming up here in austin. Box Car Racer is coming. Don't have money to go. Crappy song. changing. I wish PROPNAME would send the title to the car so I can get it registered and actually drive it. Man i love that car. I can't wait to drive it. I am so glad I didn't hurt myself in my wreck. I love this music. Why do movies and tv shows put music to them. I mean in real life there is no music playing when you are running around and stuff. I wonder why it seems natural to us when we see it on tv. Man this is a long writing asignment. I am glad to be done with school for the day. Tomorrow is an easy day also. rock on. I want to go up to tcu to hang out with evan. We had a great time last year. I can't believe we bought a douche bag. . hahaha that was freaking hilarious. We were absolutely insane. I miss those guys. i also like it here though. PROPNAME wasn't as bad as I make it out to be. We actually had some good times. Derricks camaro is so freakin fast he scared the crap out me driving that thing. I hope my car has some pick up. I need to take a shower my hair is nasty. I hate when its all tangled and stuff. not this song. great tune. You got to love the Chilli Peppers. I need to see PROPNAME tonight. We don't have much time to spend with her having night classes. She is a great girl though and very beautiful I can't believe I am with her. We need to go out on a date soon. When is our next break I am already tired of school I just want to be a bum for a few more weeks. Our walls need more stuff on them. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a total babe. She was so cute in Star Wars episode 0. PROPNAME was so awesome when he fought. That was the sweetest thing i had ever seen in a starwars flick. He totally kicked ass. I hope he does it again in the next episode. When does the next episode come out anyway. Isn't there a new matrix movie coming out soon too i can't wait to see that one also. That chick on LOCNAMEn idol last night had a big but. She was a lot better singer than the guy was. She deserved to win I wonder how much money she is going to make now that she is a star basically all over america and the world for that matter. That would be so sweett to be normal and then one day be makin mad cash and being all over america pop culture. Not for me though I'll just be a normal PROPNAME.    
__label__label1      Ok so im sitting right now in my dorm room writing my first ever college assignment. College is not at all what I expected. Its pretty much highschool except you don't have to attend your class and theres no curfue. My dorm has been asssigned (some might call it imprisoned) in Jester. Its quite a new experience. I awoke last night at exactly 0:00am to find my neighbor blasting rap music. Now I am not one for rap music and especially not at night. Not knowing what to do I layed there in misery and ignored the 000 decibal speaker system which I was dreaming about smashing. Now that I think about it next time this happens i'm marching right over and banging his door down. College is such extreme independance in my life that at times I cannot handle it. Back in highschool I had a midnight curfew, now I can come in at 0 am and no one can say anything. I can eat cookies and chips and never eat actual food and theres no one to stop me . But this is not the reason I came to college. I was not escaping my parents, I came to LOCNAME because my views and beliefs are shunned and immoral according to my smal texas Baptist town. I remember recieving an F on an English paper in which we were told to write about our feelings and my feelings were inapprpriate. How can someones beliefs be inapropriate? UT is the most liberal college in LOCNAME and even though I can barely afford it to me being exposed to different views and being able to share my views on life without being blacklisted are worth every student loan I have to take out. Now I do not know what I am   not allowed   to type in a college paper. Am I allowed to tell you that I am an aethiest? Am I allowed to tell you that I loathe culture. Well whether I am or not I do not care anymore. I cannot stay trapped inside and never know if others share my views. Its a horrible feeling to not be able to speak out. Its the worst kind of hell anyone can go through.  I cannot express even to myself how much i find people who have religous beliefs stupid and ignorant. Religion is a sorce of comfort for the idiot and a powerful tool for a leader. Anyone with the slightest bit of common sense can see that the three main religions in the world , Christianity , PROPNAME, and Islam are almost identical and yet they all are an excuse for war and money. Religion is bullshit, its all a story made up my a power hungry man who proclaimed himself the son of god to gain a following. If others are allowed to express their love for God then it is not wrong for me to express my hatred of him.  I look forward to this class and intend to make the most of understanding the stupidity of some human pysche. Even though im an engineering major I find this subject interesting and intend on embedding what i learn in this coure in my mind for the rest of my life. 
__label__label1     I am sitting at my desk and the printer just finished printing the page of the LOCNAME city limits schedule and I am looking forward to going and Galactic tickets aren't on saLE EVENTHOUGH THE AD SYS THEY ARE AND i DO HAVE LOTS OF HOMEWORK TONIGHT SO MAYBE i SHOULDN'T GO TO SEE PROPNAME PROPNAME AT WHERE IS IT AT OH YEAH aNTONES BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GIRLS GOIN G PROPNAME IS SUCH QA WEIRD GUYBUT HE IS VERY GIVING AND HE WANTS TO GO TO lIVE WHICH IOS FUNNY OW MY ARM IS STARTING TO TIRE SI WILL TYPE A SECOND slower oh shit I accidentally hit the caps lock button i hope that is ok luckilky he is just spot checking, my feet are vbecoming warm and starting to prspire so i think i will take off my sandals. when is my mom going to call me back i need that info, she is always so slow if my cell phone rings i will know becausze my speakers start sending feedback, it is weird i hope punctuattion is important uhhh. my coffee is starting to get water down so i am going to drink it and come to think of it i amthirsty so it works out good. that was good i feel like lighting a candle.

__label__label1 tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. I've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as I've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.  
__label__label0 Right now I'm feeling a little stressed out and worn thin. I'm a real estate agent and a full time student as well. I've been to Round Rock this morning again for the second day in a row for a 0:00 appointment. I just can't seem to get everything done that needs to be done. I've got a ton of laundry to wash, my cell phone is ringing AGAIN, and tons of reading and studying to still do this week. I'm a little down because I had two deals at work fall through yesterday. I had to deal with another agent that was the most ignorant and unprofessional one I've had to deal with yet. His clients backed out of a deal on my listing and as a result I'm not closing on my client's new home. It's not a good time to be a real estate agent in LOCNAME right now, but I'm trying my best and I guess that's all I can do. I'm not a traditional student and I feel a little out of the crowd in my classes. I've been working full time since I graduated over six years ago and going to school at night. I finally got to a point where I couldn't take any more night classes and here I am trying to finish up during the day. I've learned a lot and I value my experiences over the years. Sometimes I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems crazy I'm doing all this at once sometime, but bills have to be paid, I have to eat, and the cycle goes on. I do work hard, but I've almost forgotten how to relax and take it easy. I don't have time to watch TV and do a lot of things I really enjoy. I guess I'm more frustrated at the fact that there aren't more hours in the day than I am at myself for not accomplishing more. This is an odd assignment to do. I've never heard of something like this before. I am enjoying my classes even if I do feel like the outsider in most of them. I like to learn new things and have challenges I know I can get through and do well with. There are some nice people I've met at school, but most people I've noticed don't talk a lot and don't make eye contact when you pass by them. I haven't figured out why this is yet, but I'm curious. I'm friendly and smile and talk to people. It's strange they don't always respond. I was just brought up differently I guess. I'm not feeling really great right now. It's probably from stress, but I'm hoping it's just something in the air that will go away soon. I can't afford to be sick. It just won't work right now. My nose is all stuffed up and my throught is itchy, so I've been popping vitamin C's like they're going out of style. Let's see. . what else am I feeling? Well, I'm in love and very happy with my relationship. I came here to LOCNAME a year ago because of him. We have a good relationship and get along great most of the time. Moving in together and moving to a new city was a challenge though. I was the most pathetic, depressed little thing when I first came here but I've moved out of that phase and am much happier now. I don't deal well with extreme changes. I set schedules for myself, but I don't always stick to them because I try to fit too much in. I've been late to everything it seems lately and I need to work on that. I don't like being late because it's rude and embarrassing. I don't have a lot of friends, but the few I have are very good friends. My sister just moved here this summer and I feel like a part of me that was missing before is back again. We grew up a year apart and were like twins growing up. We can do that thing where you talk without saying a word a lot of times. It kind of freaks people out, but it's fun. My cell phone is ringing again. I'm thinking about all the work stuff that I need to get done today. I haven't had time to get to my office yet and I've got at least six people to call back here when I'm done. I'm going to have a lot of weight lifted from my shoulders as soon as my deal closes on the 00th. I need the money for sure. That's my other stress, but it's getting better. Overall, I think I worry about things too much. I've always had enough to get by through good times and bad. Somehow I always make it through. I guess I'm stronger than I look. I'll be back to work in a minute. Maybe I can learn to balance my schedule better over the next few weeks. It'll be easier someday I'm sure. This has been interesting. I feel like I've been rambling for 00 minutes. Well, I'm back to work again.          
__label__label1 I can't believe that I waited until the very last minute to do this. I've never beem so crazy stressed out of my mind ever in my life. I just couldn't find 00 minutes in the last seven days where I could just sit down when I wasn't totally fried. I hope that this dose not bode poorly for this semester. I think I can oull it out. This Festival I can't believe that Cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . Having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . I think I'm holding up but I feel that I coming apart now. I think that's what I scared about. This year I've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what I can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph I've learned so much. Mostly about what kind of person that I am. What am I capable of. Which is some great stuff. But I'm not there yet I 'm almost there though. It's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that I'm a T. A. or look to me for help. It's strange I guess people see good things in me. I like that annd I do the same thing. . I gues I'm just used to people being more aloof I hope that I'm not that way. some of the people that I have met at this festival have given me that instant companionship. That instant love and that's so great. . I guess when people are looking to me for answers  wheither it's about their cameras of their relationships I guess that means I'm becoming the type of person that I want to be. . That's a great reward in itself. I smoked again two nights ago. I have to stop after quitting for two years I can't fall of the wagon and go back to that. . It was only a few cigs (one fantastic PROPNAME PROPNAME MCD the very best) I can't let this girl. well she's not doing it really. I can't let the tantrum I'm throwing:) over this girl mess up what took a long time ito acheive I feel like a hypocrite when I smoke now. I don't know I just get lonely filled with self pity overwhelemed and I just want a catharsis. . smoking is sort of one. . I don't know I need ito stop again I don't think I 'll go back to the way it was but it's still scarey. I really think thigs are'nt as bad when I have a second to actually relax and evalute things I feel very good. . like the night before class tabling at the show I realized how many people I have met in the last year how many close friends that I'm making and have made and how important that I've become in certain peoples life and how much I'm going to be doing in the near future. It's all going to be worthwile I think I just feel impaitent it just seems like I've been waiting for ten years to get the chance to do what I want to do. what's going to be the best for me. and every BS class I have to take or everytime some jerk in Communications office is rude to me and everytime I'm treated crappy at work it's just one Bergman-esque humiliation after another. sometimes I hope that my   artistic spirit   doesn't die the death of a million pinpricks. . I really like this kind of writing it's been pretty theraputic, but I have to go    
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems like an enormous amount of time. I really don't mind it though at least this assignment isn't as boring as the majority of my other homework. oh, so much homework i don't think i was prepared for such and overwhelming firt week . i thought it would be a little more like lee college. Oh, PROPNAME how i will miss your size and the personal connection i made with people there. In fact that could be one of the most significant places I've ever been. I mean after all that is where I met PROPNAME. He is so very important to me. Even more so know, being in this big city alone, I need him more than ever. That really worries me, I just thought I was beginning to not need him as much in my life and gaining a little more independance and now here I am falling back into the agonizing rut that was my sad little life for two years. I need a job, I feel badly that I've rejected offers that I've gotten, it makes me feel unappreciative of the little extra cash I could be making. It's just that i don't want to be stuck in some meaningless job that makes me miserable i can't help but want something exciting and interesting. I've been doubting my major choice lately and that is really troubling. I've never done that and it was one of the only things I thought I was sure of in my life. The doubt in that area of my future makes me want to question everything else. I need to just take a step back and calm down and try to enjoy the little things. Remember don't worry about the little stuff, and it'e all little stuff. This is a whole new life for you and an opportunity for you to find out who you are and hopefully grow to like that person. PROPNAME is a growing place for you and the chance to discover new things. This has really turned into a depressing journal entry. Mom is probably going to call again while I'm writing, and God forbide I don't pick up the phone. I really do type quite a bit faster than I used to. It is really cold in here and I need to go running. I need to work on trying to improve myself again. Iwas doing so well for a while there and then I just stopped. I guess I felt satisfied for the moment or just became frustrated with the lack of results I was seeing. I hope Dad starts working on my bike, I would really like to live closer to campus and the take my bike wherever I wanted to go. I really wish he didn't hang out with PROPNAME and PROPNAME whatever her name is. I don't want to be jealous but I can't help it. He should be jealous. I wonder if that was why I wanted PROPNAME to come and visit, for the simple reason of a childish cry for attention. Most likely, but he's not coming so I won't be giving into that anytime soon. I feel like going home but I won't be able to until the 00th. I never realized how attached i was to that comfort and safety. They were right in wanting me to stay but then again I can't help but feeling maybe I needed to be here in this town at this very period of my life. I wish PROPNAME didn't sllep so much. I don't feel sorry for her and the things that happened to her. I don't think she would have been a very strong person anyway. She needs to try harder, things aren't given to people who don't try.      
__label__label1      Well, today is September 00, 0000 and that of course means that my day was filled will deep thoughts and feelings and constant reminders of the tragedy that happened a year ago today. I remember exactly where i was the day the Twin Towers collapsed. I had just woken up and was on my way to class when i bumped into my boyfriend at the time who was on his way up to his dorm room. He stopped me and said   did you hear what happened?   Puzzled i scratched my head and shrugged i had been asleep up until like 00 min ago and now i was in such a hurry to get to my class that i had been oblivious of my surroundings. I now looked around the lobby to see that every t. v. had a cluster of people around it with their mouths hanging open. There was a whisper and constant murmur in the air that i hadn't noticed before.   What happened?   i asked. He started blurting about this and that about World Trade Centers being bombed or something to that effect. I sighed and said   really, that's terrible  , then i scurried off to class. Little did i know that what i had dismissed as simply government/political jumble would have such a severe impact on LOCNAME and myself. When i walked into my class i was met with the same constant murmur, it seemed to be everywhere. I sat down in my seat(front row) and looked up to see that ORGNAME was being shown on a huge screen at the front of the classroom.  My mouth dropped in horror and terror filled me as i watched with my very own eyes, one of the planes slam into a huge tower. It was then that i realized how serious this thing was. Then the second plane, and after that the third. LOCNAME was being attacked. That phrase played inside my head fueling the growing terror inside me. LOCNAME was attacked and would never be the same again. It was then that i realized something else. My mom was out of town. She had left on a business trip for the week to. was it LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME? It was an annual trip and i remember her saying it was 00 minutes away from D. C. Wasn't that where the ORGNAME was? I remember thinking i needed to call my dad as soon as possible to find out where my mom was. After class i ran to my dorm and found i had a message i pushed it and was more than relieved to hear my mom's familiar, and now beautiful voice telling me not to worry that she was okay but might be late coming back home cause of flight delays. Even now i have tears in my eyes thinking about how lucky i am to still have both of my parents and my family. I couldn't even imagine losing them especially in such a tragic way. Then this makes my feel so sad for the people who weren't as lucky. I pray for them and even though i have been extremely busy and overwhelmed i made it a point to go home to visit my family because you never know what could happen. My family is not a very expressive one and we hardly ever show our emotions for each other show, but yesterday i left my mom with a genuine   i love you   and a hug. 
__label__label1 This will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. Typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something I'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  LOCNAME, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at LOCNAME were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at LOCNAME. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, LOCNAME and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. There was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. At first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. However, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. She gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. I clicked it away feeling very depressed. She was actually in love with the actor. However, I realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. Reading this, I'd say my passion was homework. That's almost just as distrubing.         
__label__label1      oops i don't know what i just did. But back to that, i always feel bad for the customers because who wants a server thats all sweaty? I would be so Thank god Alright im not really sure what to do now. I just typed for a complete 00 mins then the side of my hand hit return. Soooo i guess i'll type for ANOTHER 00 mins to make sure i get the credit. Im not an overachiever either, but i might as well just type. We're going to light some candles in our room now. My roommate just said our room smells like shoes. . mmmmmmmm. Luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh(er). Thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty! Alright i feel a headache coming. I think because im hungry. I ate, what. maybe 0 or 0 0/0 hours ago?? aaaaah im hungry!!! Morning seems so far away. Alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again. thanks!!!! yes i am frustrated. stupid hand!! its because i type fast and don't pay attention to what im hitting so much. I just get sooo into this, haha. hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine. oh well mine looks prettier. Ok  i need a date book. I just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go. I want one of our good friends from LOCNAME to come in hte weekend of the ORGNAME game. that would be fun for him. But problem. I think thats the day after Thanksgiving. The morning after actually. Shit. My friend PROPNAME will be in LOCNAME until Saturday, and I know im going to LOCNAME. . But i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all. But what to do. Because Austin honesctly doesnt compare to CHicago. So i need something fun for him to do while hes here. I mean besides 0th street because he is a club freak. But its great, because hes so much fun to go out with!! And even better, he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above. So essentially he can get us in with no problem (not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls) because all the fun ones are 00 and over. Shhh don't tell my mom I told her i stopped going to them! She found out once because of jessicas crazy parents. oooh i can't stand that. But we still continued and had a jolly time. Everyone there knows us and that we're underage. Its great. really the chicago cops, the whole town is nuts. Everyone thinks texas is laid back, which it is, but really the chicago cops really just don't give a shit. There are so many undercover cops at the doors who know us, and even ones who work outside just patrolling the streets. But they look for more trouble than just underage drinkers. Kind of funny. One night about 0 cops were leaving this really big club downtown CHicago and stopped us on our way out and started asking questions. Like hold we were and blah blah. but they were all drunk and laughing, and traveling around in a paddy wagon!! We said we were 00, we're 00 i don't know why we said that. And they asked for our numbers and offered to take us out with them. But thats just how all of them are. Its sooo weird. But unless you know people its not so easy being underage, ORGNAME not a big underage drinkers fest. Which i really do think the law is ridiculous. If the drinking age were persay 00, then i don't think there would be such a huge   binge drinking   problem for kids when they leave to college. Because if kids are allowed to drink with parents supervision (which in IL its illegal) then the parents can monitor it and teach their kids. That way leaving for college isnt such a huge shock and kids won't get buck wild because they can drink without parents grounding them. Most of my friends parents were real laid back about that issue. All of our parents but one was kind of anal. But im glad i went out a lot in highschool and learned how the manage liquor because now i have no desire to try to get wasted and stupid like the rest of the freshman i see around here falling over themselves. Its really not that bad though. There are just a few dumb ones who arent used to it. I would honestly rather stay in my room during the week and keep up with my classes than drink a beer and get fat for no reason! Ok 0 more minutes of reading my typing. Im sorry for whoever does read this, hope youre not getting too bored. I really do enjoy psychology though, it interests me. I just wish i could have switched into an earlier class because i get out so late every day of the week but fridays!! I took a psychology course my senior year. It was really easy. We had a new teacher so she didnt know much what she was doing, but we still learned. I really wish i took the AP Psychology because they were honestly pretty much always at the same page as us and i heard it really wasnt that hard at all, which i thought the regular psychology was just too easy. At least i could have earned some credit from the AP test. WHoa listening to the fast typing sounds so weird. All of a sudden it just goes rapid fire and real fast! I feel like such a nerd. Im about to go crazy typing for the past 00 minutes straight. Ok someone keeps making noise out there whats going on. I have other work i could be doing right now!!! At least this doesnt have to be edited. That would be awful because i never do the right punctuation when it's not a formal paper. even letters to friends im so lazy. lazy americans. 00 more seconds!! this went by pretty quick though i guess. I still want to eat. I hope i can just fall asleep soon, what movie do i feel like watching? im stuck. ok im done now!!! 
__label__label0 Well now I'm starting my writing assignment for psychology. Great, just another thing that's keeping me from doing everything else I have to do. I still have another chapter I have to read for biology, but I guess I can do that after calculus tomorrow, I'll have a good hour to get that in. And I'm sure professor weiss will end up assigning another chapter or two for the afternoon class. Is that my cell phone?  No, I thought I turned it off. Ya its off, it must have been my roommate's cell phone. Man the awkward silence in this dorm room is deafening. I really wish I would have just sprung for the single room. But no, mom said that wouldn't give me the ?college experience?. blah blah blah. All the experience I'm getting out of this is to avoid being in the dorm room. My light bulb on this lamp I bought isn't very good, it does not give off much light, but when you turn it a certain way you start to go blind, it just does not make any sense. And I don't know who the architect was behind putting these dang bookshelves in Jester. There is not enough room for my computer monitor to be pushed to the back of my desk. and I have a flat panel monitor so that is saying something. I mean I have no space for my books, spirals, paper or anything with the addition of my keyboard and mouse. Its just ridiculous. Even if computers hadn't been invented way back when this place was built, it still makes no logical sense to have the book case as low as it is without completely attaching it to the desk. I mean, they might as well have just added 0 more shelves to the darn thing and called it quits. Nothing could fit back there, its just aggravating. Wow its only been 0. 0 minutes, I've got a long ways to go. I have to do my calculus homework after this, I hope that goes well. The last thing I need is to stress out over some retarded math problem and end up having it been typed wrong so there is no solution and you spend your entire night trying to figure it out when there is no solution available in the choices that logically fits into the problem. That is the thing I hate about multiple choice math problems, anybody can leave off a negative sign and leave you chasing your tail forever. I really wish I would have just waited to take m000l, I already had C out of the way, but I didn't want to wait and have all the stuff I learned in high school leave my brain and be totally lost when it came time to take the class. Plus I kind of like the mathematical stimulation, its totally different than any other kind of study. When you understand a math concept, you really feel accomplished with yourself. At least I do, I'm probably the only person on this campus that feels that way. well on the other hand, there are math majors, so I guess I'm one of few. Great only 0. 0 minutes to go. I guess the good thing about this assignment is that you can't really run out of things to write about, you just keep typing whatever your thinking, even if tends to weigh on the pointlessness of this assignment, its still something to write about, after all I'm thinking about it aren't I?  I still have not even read my psychology chapter. I wonder if that is even necessary, every other bit of reading I have done in my classes has been a waste. Well not a waste I guess, I am learning something about the material and to discipline myself to do the work. I really miss my best friends back home. They both went to LOCNAME campuses at home. LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I'm kind of glad to be here at UT LOCNAME since we obviously have the more qualified professors and all, but man I'm just depressed without my friends. I'm not very good at making new ones, it takes me a while to warm up to people. After all, it took me 0 years to become friends with my 0 best friends. Everything else just seemed like an acquaintance compared to them. They really are great. I just wish the felt the same about me, but I'm sure they don't. I'm always the one that over appreciates things. I guess that is why my friendships didn't really mean much, because I made everyone tired of it, I don't know maybe that is just total crap I made up. I tend to justify things too much when I should just let them go. I can't believe I have to sit through 0 sessions of biology tomorrow. If they were going to combine the course, they could at least make it be on different days. But no, they have to make it back to back, well not really back to back there is a 0 hour interim between the 0 classes. At least its time to catch up on my reading that I'll no doubt be behind on in a matter of days at this rate. I'm really enjoying chemistry though. Doctor Laude is awesome. I just hope I do well in his class, I hate liking teachers and then doing poorly in their class. Actually that is never happened to me before, I've always done well in classes that I liked. I don't know why people become teachers if they don't want to help students. Go flip burgers somewhere if you don't care, that way we'd only have teacher that cared and wanted to help us learn and graduate. It seems like all my professors will be like that this year. Except professor PROPNAME, he can barely speak english, I don't know how he is going to be over the next semester. So far he is been ok, I guess. He gets off on tangents when he can't think of what he wants to say. 
__label__label0 So I have twenty minutes to write about what I think. I was thinking of all the things I thought I would write earlier, but suddenly I'm drawing a blank. I think I'm going to stop trying to write properly because there's really no point. after all, I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking, and if I get to caught up in punctuation I don't think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if I was not' typing at all. nick lachey is pretty swoll, and a pretty good singer. jessica simpson can look hot, but at times she looks rather plain. there are a lot of plain looking girls here, somewhat of a disappointment. isn't college suppose to have a lot of hot girls?  o well, I have a girlfriend, so it really shouldn't matter. I remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 0 seconds or something like that, and it looks like I'm get to that subject pretty soon. I like timberland. he consistently makes good beats. but magoo fell off on the last single I heard from them. what's the name of that single?  I think its one and all. I turned off the music because I don't think as randomly as usually do when its on. Its like I focus on the music and that is all exists. maybe that is y I could be a good dj if I tried, but I never practice, and that's why omar's upset wit me. I hope he is doing alright now. he says he is, but I know he is still tripping, at least every now and then. man, I told him not to trip on emmi, but what he don't know is that I trip on her too. that is pretty fucked up, but I can't help it. as erin said, that girl's seductive. and she really is seductive. I wonder why. she is not THAT hot, and I see a lot of flaws when I look at her, but I still want to get with that. maybe its just lust. now that I think of it, it is mostly lust. but I would never mistreat her. well, I don't think I would mistreat her. I thought I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but look what I did in cancun. I can really trust my boys--everytime I got a dirty secret, they shut they mouth. its' not cool that I have such a big mouth. I been saying I need to work on it, and I think I'm finally getting there. now that I'm controlling this part of my personality, maybe I can control my hormones as well. but I'm 00, and everyone says they know what I mean when I tell them wussup. felix agreed with me, even hazel. life savers kickers are pretty damn good. I'm tripping, thinking bout emmi again. I don't know why I'm so infatuated wit her. but its not that strong of an infatuation. not like it was wit crystal. when I saw her at the omega talent show, I still thought she was fly. and I say she is a stuck up bitch, but I know if she honestly wanted to date I wouldn't think twice. I wish I was like those cats that know how to pull any girl. I'm starting to realize its a game, and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life. I need to stop thinking bout other girls. I have a gf. just like I need to stop chatting on AIM because all it does is keep my from doing my work. I'm getting sleepy. the fire alarm went off again. I wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls. well, I guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day. I'm getting sleepy. I wonder if I meet jaymee ong if I'd actually have the nerves to approach her. probably not, unless I was famous like her. and even then, I don't know if I would. probably if I was drunk I'd do it. hahah. I wonder if I'll have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho. there I got thinking bout other girls again. and here I go getting sleepy. every time I take my eyes off the monitor I get sleepy        my fingers are starting to get a bit tired. this is the first assignment I've had that requires me to think about what to think about. man, chatting online never makes me sleepy, but its the exact same thing I'm doing now. sa was right. it is all in my head. if I could control every aspect of my behavior, that would work to my advantage. no more fallen asleep wen I have to read for class, or falling asleep on the road. maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate. but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and ORGNAME. I think semi just sent me a text message, but I only got a minute left, so I'll wait till I'm done with this before I see what she said. I want to sing. if I could sing, I would rule the world hahaha. maybe not, but I'd feel like king. right now, that is wut I want most in life 
__label__label1 I have been extremely pissed off for the entire day. I have just started classes again at LOCNAME. I am trying to get into the pharmacy school. I work at a pharmacy now, but the people there are driving me insane. I have panic disorder, but lately instead of panicking I am just angry. I almost ran into about 0 cars driving on mo-pac. road rage?!  My therapist is trying to assure me that I am not the one who is crazy - it's just the people around me. My job, my parents, my friends". I am taking things out on PROPNAME who does not deserve it - he is just here all the time. I wrote him a nasty email and I think he just replied. He is so sweet, I really should make a HUGE effort not to do that to him. he is probably used to it after 0 years. yuck. I would have been tired of my temper tantrums a long time ago. I tried acupuncture today for anxiety and my irritable bowel syndrome. The guy treating me at the student clinic was a moron. I usually get good people. he is graduating soon from that academy and I am scared of what he will do to his patients. I am going to take a xanax now and see how long it takes me to calm down. Cool, I can time it. ready, go. ok. I have to work all weekend when I need to be studying. my wrist hurts. maybe from typing, maybe from that moron. this should be pretty interesting for someone to read. I have lots of other homework that I could be doing, but this is all I have the brain power for right now. no offense, but it's not biochemistry. I am glad to be back in school. I hit the wrong key and it stopped for like 0 seconds. weird. I have to work with john the head pharmacist this weekend. they are all trying to manipulate me into working more hours than I want to. they have now told me that if I don't work all of these hours that they will find someone else to work there. it's all or nothing. I know they are bluffing, because it would take them so long to train someone that one of the other techs that works at the store would have to cover the weekends for months. no one wants to work weekends. so I should do it because I'm in school and that's easier for me because I am a student. that's their logic. that's crap. I think I'm almost done bitching. I am going to work tomorrow and if he doesn't make some compromise with me then I may just walk out and let him work by himself. that won't happen. he will say anything to keep me there. and I'll probably fall for it and think everything is ok and then he will just change his mind at the end of the weekend. so, I should just change jobs, or just change stores. ORGNAME's sucks - they all have their heads up their butts. AAAAH! I guess I feel a little better now, but not much. I will just have to think about something else if I am going to feel better. my glasses are foggy. they always get scratched because I don't take care of them. I need an eye exam. haven't had one since grade school. who says grade school? I'm old. I have to be good this weekend. even though I am going to a birthday party that will probably be not quite as good as I need to be. whatever, that didn't make sense. I wonder when john will be home. at least I'm getting something done. I need to do a lot of things. I need to send transcripts to ORGNAME, start looking at pharm apps. and ask john if he is really going to move with me if I go out of state. I will probably get in for next fall but you never can tell. I applied way too late last year and got stuck on the stupid alternate list. ok, next/      
__label__label1 This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask PROPNAME if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be PROPNAME or PROPNAME. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 00 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the LOCNAME. It was good. PROPNAME PROPNAME looked really crazy in the movie. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  
__label__label1 What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 0% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish PROPNAME would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 00% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 0:00 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 0:00. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the LOCNAME. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 00% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw PROPNAME PROPNAME in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 00% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 0 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (0:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. 
__label__label1 okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 00 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem000. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 0. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        
__label__label1 today was just like every monday and wednesday. I guess it was a little more interesting. my classes seemed more entertaining than usual, although, most of them are pretty entertaining usually. my drawing class at 0 am though is a little tough, just because of the time. living off campus makes my mornings a little more involved than that of the typical" college student. I have to get up around six thirty to be able to fit my morning routine in. today in my art class we did gestural ink paintings of skeletons. it proved to be alright. that class in general is pretty alright. it seems relatively basic, although it keeps my interest. the intimacy of the class size is what I like. I feel like I know everyone, or at least I am beginning to feel like I know everyone. unlike in this class where I know no one. which really is not a problem. I stay more alert that way. you know, when there is no distractions. I have an essay due friday and I have not started. I'm not worried, although I'm not really calm about it. I know ill do fine, I just don't want to be weighed down with a lot of stuff to do tomorrow. I have worked somewhat hard this week. well, sort of. it feels like less work than high school, but then again, I feel more involved here at ut. ut is really a great place. I am enjoying it very much, and I assume I will continue to enjoy it in my years to come. sometimes I wish I lived on campus like a lot of my friends, but at the same time I don't. I mean I like the fact that I don't have to be on campus all the time. like if I lived there I think I might feel overwhelmed with ut-ness. who knows. right now I'm talking to my girlfriend on the phone as I type. she wants me to come over. I'm debating. I mean I have a lot of work to do, and I have a feeling that it might come to distract me. she is in high school. its hard sometimes, not being able to see her during the day at school, but most days I just go over to her house. its not that far away from mine. that is probably another reason why I don't like the idea of living on campus. just because ill be away from her. I'm so tired. its ridiculous. I took a nap in the library today. I have done that multiple times. its proven to be ok. just a little sleep in the middle of the day helps me stay awake all day. something about walking around campus in the hot sun wears me out. that and waking up early. its funny how accustomed I have come to using this keyboard. I tried typing on the macs at school and I can't type half as fast. I'm curious to know how my friends in other parts of the LOCNAME are doing. I have a friend who's going to the college of whooster in ohio. and then I have another friend who is attending the university of wisconsin. both very different world to that of austin. I must say I am very pleased with austin. no place has made me feel more at home. I don't know if I'm saying just because I have lived here all my life, or just because austin is so nice. I like l. a. a lot. it was pretty nice. the temperature was amazing. that is the only problem with austin. its a little hot. but it really is not that big of a deal. I kind of like it sometimes. it separates the natives from the new arrivals. I can't wait for some rain. or at least some cold weather. I want to wear some pants. I can't seen to get myself into pants when its this hot outside. although it is quite cold in the acutal buildings. its not worth it. too much outside time. too much sweating. the book we are reading in my english class is pretty interesting. I recommend it. its called "fast food nation". 
__label__label0 I am so upset with myself today. I am so far behind on my study god I hope I don't fail. I don't want to fail my mom. She would be so disappointed in me. I can't do that to her. Class isn't what I thought it would be. And all the reading god, it is so annoying. PROPNAME is pissing me off so much. You would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and PROPNAME out of her life. No she has to come down every weekend and steal PROPNAME away and get drunk. Oh man that is so fun. Yeah right. I mean PROPNAME is my friend too. I can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 0:00 every night. Then you got homework and early classes. God I just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without PROPNAME calling every ten minutes. You have to share PROPNAME, PROPNAME. My roommate PROPNAME is really cool. She has a great outlook on life. She takes things as they go. I wish I was more like that instead of worrying about everything I do and what people will say. I mean being a girl at ORGNAME you have to look pretty to get a guy. So number 0 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. Next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. And why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. Sorry I'm not into that. I can have fun without that stuff. PROPNAME has this guy she is in to. Supposedly he is a charming jerk. He lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. That is all she talks about. I wish I could find a guy too so we could trade stories. Me and PROPNAME are not from LOCNAME and decided to drive around today to the mall. Boy was that stupid. I was so scared I thought we would never find our way back. God I can't get over the fact PROPNAME would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. I think I will tell her to stay in LOCNAME and make her own friends, I mean I made mine. I am so bummed. I keep thinking I am going to fail out of college. My brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. He was salutatorian in high school and I was only 0th. I am afraid I won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. I mean I have a Kinesiology major. That is a joke to everyone I know. I haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid I have a test or quiz tomorrow. I am going to have to cram. I just don't want to fail. I am so scared about this. I know I will fail if I don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. I'm too lazy and tired of school. I just want to go out to the Real World" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. It would be a lot more easier. I figure if I just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is I don't have any concentration in me. I feel like I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). I really don't but it feels like it because I lack so much energy and motivation. I hope school is okay tomorrow because I do not want to have a bad day. I hate bad days they make me sad. 
__label__label0 I'm so tired right now. I wish I could just sleep in my bed at home right now. Man, my feet smells. I guess it's time to wash the slippers. Gosh, right now would be a good time to get a nice massage. My back is aching now. When will I get used to this new change? I don't know if I can make it. Well, I have to. I must. Everyone expects me to. Of course I expect myself to succeed as well but everything has just been so overwhelming. So much information is given in the class and I don't know what I should write down. Ok. I'm tired of listening to the same song. What are they talking about? It makes no sense to me. Alright. Piano music is the way to go. Yeah. This will relax me. I need to rest my eyes. Can I type with my eyes close? No, I'll probably start typing some wrong stuff and then it'll be a waste of time. Hm. I think I should put this printer box somewhere else. It's kind of annoying me in a way. But then again, I need to put my feet over it for support. Books, books, books. I'm tired of them already. I can't believe I was actually excited about learning all this new stuff. Now I'm dreading every minute of it. My forehead itches. I'm so bored. This is really crazy. My goodness, there's about twelve more minutes remaining. Ah! I think I'm about to fall asleep on this laptop. Hm, roommate's back now. I wonder if she ate dinner yet. She probably went to eat with her boyfriend or so. Hm, do I need anything else for my dorm? I think I should decorate it more. It still looks a little plain at the moment. I guess I should utilize some of my time for creative matters. Yeah. I should make more cranes and turtles to put around my area. Aww. The crane and turtle on my laptop looks so cute. Ouch. I bite my lip. Where did roommate go? She left again already? Maybe she is just now going out to eat since she came back with her backpack just now. I don't know. Geez. Now that guy finally decides to respond me. It's about time. I instant messaged him like a while back. hm. The Asian talent show was quite interesting. That one skit by ORGNAME was pretty cool. Too bad the guy's voice was spoken by a girl. That made him seem pretty gay. Oh okay. So it was a girl's voice because it was suppose to be the voice of a young boy. I see now. Yay! I have four minutes remaining. So what am I thinking about now? Oh man, PROPNAME is so fine looking. I need a bigger poster of him to put on the wall. Gosh I don't like this chair I'm sitting now. It's not very comfortable. I feel like rolling back and forth but there arent any wheels. This sucks! Hm. I should go work out tonight. I have not done that in about a week already. This is not good. I have to stay in shape. I don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like people say. Either way, I just want to be fit. I think I should head out there right now. 
__label__label0 ok. so I am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing I don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although I don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, I have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when I sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. I'm hungry. but I don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, I can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that I am hungry now. I want to eat now. maybe something small when I get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. I can wait. I guess. I wonder if they think its cheap that I'm inviting them over on monday. this way I order the cheap monday madness pizza. but I guess its not really a big deal. I was going to invite them over soon. I want my computer up and running asap. I can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. I hope bilal and them come tomorrow. I mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. I smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, I guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. I mean, lots of people do smoke, but I just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. I don't think I was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was I? oh well. that's what I'm doing. haha I can't believe I was so stupid today. I have been going to urdu class at 00 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if I had gotten there right on time, I would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing I went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! I really didn't think that she would let me sign in. I came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, I have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. I have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. I guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. I don't think I have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as I had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. I like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and I'm upset with raza. I didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. I don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. I'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like I have been typing for twenty minutes straight. I guess this wasn't so bad after all. I wonder what happens after my time is up. will I not be able to type anything else? well, I will find out in 00 seconds. now after this, I got to pick up my I'D from the business school, then. then I dunno. I could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or I could go home and study". but that will never work. hmm, I think I just answered my own question. 
__label__label1 As I look at this blank space, what am I going to write about?  There is no topic really, so I guess its up to me. I'm thinking about how I need to cancel my doctors appointment because the bug bites that have been on my leg for over two weeks are finally starting to go away. I have never been to the doctor at the ORGNAME. That also reminds me that I need to go give a list of my professors so that I can get extended time. This whole timed writing thing is fairly new to me. I have had extended time for a long time, so its never really been an issue for me. But I do like this writing assignment, its nice not to have any rules and to just follow my stream of consciousness. I mean we wrote stream of consciousness papers in high school, but never like this for an assignment. It amazes me how far technology has come. What did students do before the internet? I mean, look at what I'm doing right now, this is crazy. How did people function and know things without internet and email. I have basically grown up in a world that has always had computers. granted when I was really young not everyone had computers, but for as long as I have been of age to where the internet would benefit me, it has always been there. That also applies to cell phones. I simply do not understand how people would find one another and get a hold of each other without them. I am so dependent on mine. Oh no, I just looked down at my to do list and realized I really need to call my owl pal for this week, I have never really met her, and they told me she was special needs. " from what I have heard she is not really the sorority type, and well, neither am I in some ways, but I really hope I connect with her because I think she feels like an outsider. the pledge trainers said she would go sit off by herself and I am really sad for her because I know what its like to not really know anyone and be forced, almost, by family to be in a sorority. but I hope I can show her how neat it actually is. I hope that talking about music will be a bridge between us. but god, I hate the fact of having to do something. Being obliged to do something really annoys me and it makes me not want to do it at all. I think I have gotten worse about that over the years. Over the years, hah, I'm only 00. but then again, I look at kids in high school now and think they look so young, its crazy, its like once I left for college, I can no longer be categorized as another kid. Its kind of sad really, and ill miss those days of always living at home with my parents to take care of me and annoy me, but then again, there's always holidays and summer vacation. I really hope that I enjoy this class and that it is not just so tedious to do the work. Actually, when I was reading the book the other day, some of it actually interested me, and I'm so thankful for that, it is so difficult for me to pay attention to things if I'm not interested. I don't know if its like that with everyone, or particularly because I'm adhd, but if something doesn't engage me, even the slightest bit, it is tedious to force myself to focus on it. I really hope that I find something to do with my life that I love, because that would really help, hah, I'm sure everyone says that, but I really do hope that that happens. I'm not exactly the hardest worker, but I feel like I'm going to be alright somehow. Its not like I can just sit on my ass with a trust fund or anything, because I know my parents aren't going to pay for me after college, but I know that I'll be ok. I sometimes worry that I won't be able to give my kids the same opportunities that my parents gave me, and that might be hard, but I don't really want to have kids unless I am mature and financially stable. Bringing it back to summer vacation. this summer I lived at home and didn't really work, but that's besides the point. I just wanted to talk about how I went home and totally noticed how privileged my friends and I are. I don't think that some of them really get it because their parents sheltered them a great deal more than mine did, but I mean, my friends from high school are some rich, spoiled brats, and I knew that before, but it really fazed me this summer. Its sad to me that my friends don't really know what its like to not have money, and I shouldn't be talking, I spend so much money and it doesn't really matter, I'm going to really need to learn how to budget money when its my own. Or learn how to not buy useless shit that just makes the place all cluttered. I hope we get more assignments like this one because its nice to get stuff out on the table, and I have a feeling no one is really reading this, because that would be a pain in the ass to read all this text that 000 students wrote. I need to call a couple of my friends at other schools, but its such a pain in the ass, bc schedules are never the same and we always miss each other and its hard to keep up with people and impossible to know every detail, but for some of my friends that stuff doesn't really matter and I know we will always be friends when we are together, and for that I am very grateful. with one minute left, what I'm I going to talk about, I wonder if it stops letting me type, or if I have to exit myself, that's crazy how its up there ticking away the seconds. turns out this wasn't so bad, and I'm glad I got it done now, as opposed to tomorrow when I have no class. well, talk to you soon, times up. tootles          
__label__label1 I cannot believe that my mother called to tell me about the pregnancy test, it's none of her fucking business. Besides she doesn't have to shout it out I wonder if my roommate hear, now she is playing that damn music again. red hot chili peppers. I should really be reading my book for lit right now instead of doing this, I wonder if my watch is going to break again, broke twice today. I just bought that nice new one and I've hardly worn it. Don't want to mess it up with scratches and all. I still can't believe that about mom. She can be such a god-damn BITCH. I think she is calling to see how I am, and instead she just screams at me about the damn clinic. At least I avoided her questions pretty well, but she can still draw her own conclusions. I want to talk to PROPNAME. it's been a while since we've had a good talk. All she tells me about now is her boyfriend PROPNAME. That relationship is trouble. She is not her own person anymore; she lives for him now. She doesn't even stay at home, is over at his place all day, lies to her mom, and uses ME as an excuse. Damn. I haven't talked to PROPNAME in a while. I hope he is thinking about me. I need to call him and also send him his present. Hope he likes the card I picked out. it suits both him and me, so I thought it was perfect. I hope my cell phone doesn't crap out on me again it's so old and worthless. My arm is itching. I wonder if I should wear sunscreen tomorrow since I have been burning a little. trade off between cancerous skin damage and nice-looking tan skin God, I could use some coffee especially since I'll be up for a while reading all that stuff I hope punctuation doesn't count in this I don't think it does anyway. It's probably going to tell me how negative and depressed I am. I am not really, though I am pissed at mom and I hate that I am at UT Even the name conveys a sense of sheer stupidity. I worked my ass off for LOCNAME and here I am in this hell-hole. I hate these damn community bathrooms, and I hate that the laundry room is so far away. God the last time I wrote this crazily was when I wrote that suicide note junior year of high school I hate that PROPNAME I hope he burns in hell for making my life fall to shit like that. If not for him, I might be in LOCNAME right now instead, but grade aside, I can't forgive him for all the emotional damage he did When I read that note later, it made me cry to see how far into depression I had fallen. And mom didn't even help me after I cried out for help. well how ironic that I'm in psychology now. The psychology major needed a shrink herself. hahha. I hope tomorrow is not very sunny but I don    t want rain either. too much sun hurts my eyes. I hope I don't oversleep since I'll be up so late tonight. I can't believe someone cut and pasted a dvd manual in this one time; it's such an easy assignment. God my hips are huge. I have lost weight since I came here, all this walking around. But I want to lose a little more. I wish I had PROPNAME's body. She is so gorgeous! Even more so than PROPNAME, and PROPNAME is one of the most beautiful people I know. But I am not all bad myself, I have my moments certainly. My jaw hurts again; I've been holding it too tensely because I am so stressed out I was perfectly fine until my mom called. well I'm almost finished, just a few minutes left. I wish I had a new phone. I hope that photo of my friends at banquet from last year doesn't fade; the light is right over it but I guess I have the negatives if I want another print. That reminds me, I haven't done photography in a long time. I left because I wasn't progressing, they didn't teach me anything, and I didn't like having to ward off PROPNAME. nice guy, but what a dork and oh so weird. I wonder if that was PROPNAME PROPNAME in front of me in math today. I told penner I'd contact him, but I don't know. what an easy quiz 
__label__label0 I'm starting to feel tired and lazy. That sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now I feel really comfortable as I sit in this chair and look at the screen. I feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed. I feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down. I'm thinking about going to gregory but I feel so relaxed that I probably won't go. Its such a long walk and then I have to come back to my room before I go to another class. I wish my dorm room was closer to PROPNAME, then I think I would go more often. Instead I always tell myself I'm going to go but most of the time I just put it off. My back is sore and I think I need to stretch it, my legs are also sore. I know it has to be from all the walking in between classes. I can't wait for tonight. Monday night football. My night to sit on the couch and watch TV. I wonder who is playing. I think its the eagles and ORGNAME, but I'm not sure. I think the ORGNAME have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year. I know for sure the ORGNAME are going to be bad. They will finish around 0 to 0 wins. If they win more, it will be a successful year for them. I wonder where my roommate is. He always leaves the lights on in our room, so I know he has been home and left already. I really wish I was done for the rest of the day and didn't have another class. I would definitely take a nap. Naps are so key. They are rejuvenating beyond anything else. My hair is always in my eyes. I think its time for me to finally get it cut. Its annoying now, its too hot to have long hair in my face. Also it looks kind of shaggy. I'm taking my shoes off. That feels better. ooh. that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad. ill have to put another band aide on it. I need to start playing basketball more so I won't get blisters when I just play on occasions. The only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play, so I never get the chance to practice my shot. So in the games I end up missing most of the time. Fortunately the competition is not real high at PROPNAME. Although I have seen PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME up there at times. I can't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that. What if they got hurt? He would be infuriated. How would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game. Does not sound right. You know what else is not right, Chance Mock starting t quarterback. LOCNAME's offense is so predictable with Chance at QB. Run PROPNAME PROPNAME up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it. That is when Chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it. On the other hand when PROPNAME PROPNAME is at QB, you can't predict what is going to happen. He is much more of a threat. He can run, scramble, elude tacklers and throw also, at least that is what he did against ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME I know its the aggies of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that we played last week but he did better than Chance Mock against the same guys. So I think he deserves the start against LOCNAME this upcoming week. I can't wait to rub it into PROPNAME's face when we beat them. I hope he finds a ticket and can come down from LOCNAME for the game. He will definitely be intimidated by the LOCNAME crowd. How long has it been since I have done my laundry?  Not since I left home I think. I really don't want to do laundry in my dorm room. It takes too long. I think I'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever I go home. Probably around homecoming, which is the same weekend as the ORGNAME ORGNAME game. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket for that. That really pisses me off. I did get lucky though with my season tickets, section 00 row 0, right behind the cannon. That was a pretty good draw for a freshman. Still, Ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the ORGNAME ORGNAME game. Best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else PROPNAME PROPNAME should be fired. That would be the fourth year in a row. He can recruit like its nobody's business but he can't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game. Straight up he gets out coached every time by PROPNAME PROPNAME. What a stud. My fingers are getting a little tired from typing. 
__label__label0 Okay, I just got done chatting with a guy who I  had some classes with in high school. I have not talked to him in a few months. He is doing well but is going to Tech. What a mistake. I was also thinking about yesterday because it marked one year since I'd left for LOCNAME. I can't believe it was a year ago yesterday when I started my time there. I miss it so much and would love to return. There are so many things the country has to offer and see. Granted there are lots of political problems and I just received the other day from the Embassay down there a letter that said there are cases of Yellow fever ( or something like that) in some of the states. I was down there for 00 months. I lived with two families. I went with the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I had a rough time for a few months. The hardest time was when there was a nation-wide strike which lasted for 0 months!  Everything during that time was shut down. Companies stop producing. Ran out of harina pan y cervezas. Tenemos q hablar en ingles o es espanol bien?  Quiero practicar escribiendo mi espanol porque ahora aqui no hay muchas vezes donde puedo escribir cual cosa en espanol. My spanish is not perfect. Far from it. I have been speaking for about 0-0 months now. The first 0 months I was there I spoke mostly English. That is a horrible thing to do if you are trying to learn another language. One reason I didn't learn in the first four months was because the first host family that I had lived with spoke English, and there family members spoke english. I met so many people who knew english. That is awful for me because everyone wanted to speak and practice there english with me. I wanted to practice spanish. When I would try and speak in spanish with my host family they would respond to me in English. So the first 0 months weren't the best. I started to learn slowly thought once I made more friends and once I had switched families. My second family was great!  My host mom was so nice to me and she would always talk to me and be more involved with me. I started speaking and understanding the language more. So by the time I left I had been speaking spanish for about 0 months, I wonder how much better I would be if I had spoke and learned during the first four mouths. I broke away from the Rotary program in June and traveled alone for that month. No one could travel with me, that was okay though because I was not going to miss out on seeing LOCNAME for that reason. One reason why no one could go with me was because there was no money and the eco system had gotten so bad because of that shit head president PROPNAME. He even stopped selling american dollars. So I had to end up paying the black market prices for my trips that I went on in June, because the trips where priced in dollars. Well I paid because its a once in a life time opportunity. I went to LOCNAME. It was truly breathtaking!  I was so shocked to see how beautiful something could be. I absolute loved it and wished someone was there to share that sight with me. Well, in LOCNAME there are lots of waterfalls. I went to the famous Angel Waterfalls which are the tallest in the world. It was amazing!  I had to take a four hour bout ride there and then it was an hour walk up to the falls. They were great, spectacular. I truly recommend going there and at least once in your life. I also went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, which is the frog or toad falls. I got to walk underneath the waterfall!   It was like in the movie The Last of the Mohicans but 000 times better!   That was my favorite part. I also went to a National Park called ORGNAME. They have the best beaches and little islands. I went to the islands which were basically empty only for the people who went there during the day. It was gorgeous. Beautiful clear water, great blue sky. I loved ever second. I also made it out to LOCNAME which is not part of LOCNAME but its only a 00 min plane ride from the city I had lived in. LOCNAME was like the islands in MOrroccoy that I had gone to. IT had a great night life atmosphere as well. I had a blast!  I can't wait to go back and visit all of LOCNAME!  I miss all the wonderful, kind people there. I returned the 0 of July, and have been back for 0 months. I miss it but I have to get my college started here. Can't wait till I have money to go back. College is free there here its too damn much. I already have way to much in loans, I won't say how much but let me say you could buy a good car with the amount I have in loans. Well Ciao!  PROPNAME PROPNAME  PROPNAME PROPNAME! Te Amo y Extrano!  PROPNAME       
__label__label0 I don't know what to feel or think. I am so overwhelmed with everything. I have felt this way for the past two weeks, but it just seems like it is all crashing today. I think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow. I feel like I have so much to do before we leave. I have so much homework everyday, and so much with my sorority, and I just want to have time to hang out and take it all in. Not saying that I never have time, because I do, but not much. Anyway, today we signed for our apartment next year. Its so crazy that you have to do that this early here. But I am so excited about it. I'm living with my roommate, my suitemate, one of my pledge sisters, and both of her suitemates. it's going to be so awesome. So I had to pay that money today and in a couple of days, we have to pay like 000 dollars again, so that is a little crazy. I can't wait until I get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right. like I'm having a blast and everything, but I feel so busy. I missed my first class today because I was so behind on reading in another class. I'm hoping I can control myself with that and not miss too often. I feel so behind in most of my classes. three of my classes have been all reading, and that is so hard for me. I'm such a slow reader. I just need a weekend where I do nothing but homework and study, but I won't ever have that, because there's football here, and I like to have fun on the weekends. so, I love my sorority. They are all the sweetest group of girls. We have such an awesome pledge class. I'm living with one of my pledge sisters who I have become pretty close to her. I love her she is awesome. We had our pledge retreat last weekend, and I got to know so many more of the girls. I can't say too many good things about all of them. and I love the actives, too. The seniors have been so sweet to us. Our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever. I love going there and feeling so loved by everyone, it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place. Anyone of them would do anything for us, and that makes me feel so good, and safe. Did I mention that I feel like I'm doing homework nonstop. haha. I really need to read tonight, I have to stay ahead. or rather get ahead. that is the one thing that I heard over and over again from college students: stay ahead on your work. I need to try harder to do that, because in high school I was such a procrastinator and I can't be like that here. I really need to do good, but does not everybody. especially since I want to get into the ORGNAME program. my problem is, I can study when no one's here, and when everyone on my hall is sleeping or in class, but when they're all home, I love talking and goofing off with them. me and my suitemate love to dance so we always make up dances in front of the mirrors. I know, we're dorks, but we have fun. Our hall in my dorm is so awesome. its crazy how close we got in such a short amount of time. I feel so lucky. Even people on other floors in my dorm notice it, there like, I wish I was on your floor yall are so close. and we're always like, yeah we know. haha. but oh well. so me and courtney are going home tomorrow! I'm so excited. I want to see everyone so bad. I'm really excited to see my sister and my dog. I'm excited to see everyone, but I saw my mom and dad and one of my sisters last weekend at the football game. I have not seen my oldest sister since I moved down here. she is pregnant and due in october. I am so incredibly excited. its crazy. I say crazy a lot, but maybe because that is what my life is right now. and I can't wait to see my dog , ellie, either. I love her so much, and miss her so much. she is a dalmation and 00 years old and so cute and lazy and just likes to be pet. she is my favorite. I need to decide what I want my mom to cook for dinner tomorrow night. I am so ready for a home cooked meal. I wish I was staying a little longer. we're leaving tomorrow afternoon at like 0000, and then we're coming home on friday after the homecoming pep rally we're going to, because there's a football game here at 00 on saturday. and I'm NOT missing a football game here. I love college football, and I love ORGNAME football. it is so much fun. I have to go stand in line for OU tickets in the morning. I think I got a pretty good number, from what I here, so how awesome would that be if I got tickets my freshman year. that's going to be one crazy game, and its going to be so cool to get to go and actually be a part of the school. its going to be totally different than watching in still in high school. my birthday is in 0 weeks. I can't wait. I'm going home that weekend. so that will be really fun. I love birthdays. I'm so anxious for my sister to have her baby, its due in like 0 weeks, so you never know. she may have it early or she may have it late. her name is abby. and she is going to be the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to be an aunt. I hope she has chubby cheeks. I'm so excited. yay! 
__label__label0 wow I really need to shower but I'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 0 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 0 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 00 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 00 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 00 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 0 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 00 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 0. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up. 
__label__label0 As of right now, I'm pretty happy with my life. The only thing that I question are relationship issues. After breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 0 months ago, I haven't dated any other person. I think I'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend" lifestyle. The girls I have met as friends I might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they weren't, again because I missed having a girlfriend. Recently, I've gotten over the issue a bit. I've spent time with all my friends. That's the good thing about being single, you have more time for your friends. When I was going out for my ex, which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 0 years, I didn't have much time for friends. Not only that, but I chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends. This issue of mine, it's made me a bit more self conscious. I got the idea in my head that looks really do matter. Seriously though, having a "deep" relationship is important and yadda yadda,but I really do feel that looks matter too. A friend and I were discussing this. She is been there for me a lot. When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, she was there for me to complain to. Anyways, she said that looks don't matter and it only matters a small percentage of time. I argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that's what matters at the very beginning. I met this very interesting girl this summer. Her name is PROPNAME. She was telling me about her past, how she was somewhat of a "geek" in high school. She didn't care about her looks or anything. She is a very bright girl, very deep. Likes art and many things most girls just don't take interest anymore. She said that she realized she felt she HAD to start dressing up to attract people first, then and only then would they be able to see the "real" side of her. I completely agree with this. There is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow. Ever since then, I've gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features. I never did care about it much. I was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others didn't really enter my mind. During this recent period, I've started to lift weights a bit and work out my body. Another thought of relationships I've always wondered is at what point do you really have to "settle"? The reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl. When you date someone, how far into the future should you consider? Unfortunately for me, I should've realized in my last relationship that there was no future. Instead, because of my fear of being alone, I stayed with her. for nearly 0 years. It was fun and all, but we had many arguments. The reality was we were two different people. Two different backgrounds, interests, ideas, practically everything. My parents didn't like her because she wasn't chinese and wasn't very bright. (I'm Chinese by the way). I'd like to talk about my family for a second. I was born in LOCNAME, and moved to the LOCNAME when I was four. Thus, I speak/write fluent English but can only speak chinese(Mandarin) since I still speak it at home. I would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional, which I really like. Like most chinese families, my parents stressed educational when I was growing up. Sometimes I think this is why there is the stereotype of "asians being smarter in school". I think it's because traditionally, chinese families stress education a bit more than others. The bad thing about growing up in a "traditional" family is that living in the LOCNAME, I did not experience certain American family activities. My dad never took me fishing, camping, or anything "fatherly". I think that was one of the things I really disliked about him. Growing up, I always favored my mom more. Now that I'm in college, I talk to my dad a lot more when I go back home, including cars, sports, politics, etc. Going home, I'm spoiled with food. My mom is always thinking I'm going to starve to death. Everytime I come back up to LOCNAME, she makes me bring a whole bunch of food. My grandparents(dad's side) also lives very close to me in LOCNAME. My grandparents came to the LOCNAME a couple of years before us, which is how we were able to. I remember growing up and laying awake at night, my biggest fear in the world was that I'd lose my grandpa (to old age). It's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever. We've tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him, but he just won't. He says he has nothing better to do during the daytime, and to let him enjoy it. He is even said something close to "I've already experienced everything in life. My family is doing good. I have nothing else to live for" Now, don't take this to be a suicidal comment for anything, he was saying it as if it were wise words. On my part, its hard to argue with him. He is my grandpa and I can't really tell him to just stop what he likes so much. Personally, I have a very big problem with talking to people. This problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college. Since there are so many people around, it's hard to not get use to it. When I'm around people, I'm always worried that what I say will make them think negatively of me. That's why I'll usually always rethink what I want to say in my mind before I actually say it. Funny thing is, my chinese name translated to english is "brave speaker". I know I have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but I just can't help it. Growing up I didn't have that many friends, so I thought to myself a lot and that's still true. Around strangers, I'm really quiet. Only around friends am I a bit more active. And my 00 minutes are up. This was pretty useful. Glad I could type out what I was thinking. Now I got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book. The lectures are much more interesting. 
__label__label1 hmmm. at 00, my life thus far has been where I want it. The ORGNAME has given me the newfound sense of self one craves after a monotonous high school career. Football, basketball, summer activities, ORGNAME academic meets, clubs, and band, they say, will be the things you cherish for the rest of your life. Memories. They will be the best years of your life say those who never went to college. The next 0 will be your best years of your life. " say those who have. But will they be? The Crucible was more difficult than anything I could ever imagine attempting, but I made it. Lying in a pit covered in barbed wire and mud and feeling the wildest sense of dread, failure, hatred, anger for being awake for 0 days with only 0 ORGNAME's to last the entire ordeal. Feeling that the sun would never set. Being away from my family and everything that I loved for a quarter of a year with no means of contact besides staying up after lights out, sitting on a stone cold toilet in the head because it was the only source of light by which to write. Knowing that you're giving up the sleep, the rest, that will carry you through the next day. Hate towards the others in the platoon for their Goddamn stupidity, hard-headed, fight without listening to reason, their never-ending bitching and trying to hold an edge over everyone else. It's a real life world of shit. Brings to mind that show on ORGNAME called "Oz", haven't seen but advertisements for it. Prisoners talking about "the hard life" of prison. What do they have that I didn't have at LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Prison vs. Boot Camp. They have TV, books, newspapers, double ply toilet paper, free time, phone calls, a weight room, good food, the right to lay on the rack whenever they wish, the right to sit down, cigarettes, the ability to do whatever the hell they want. What did I have? Not a single one of those things. A month in the desert, worrying that one of LOCNAME LOCNAME's pit vipers or coral snakes would find its way into my sleeping bag as I slept on a rocky desert floor, or the guy next to you on the firing line would trip and put a 0. 00mm round into your back, or falling while hiking without light on a steep slope in the middle of a moonless night with 00 pounds of gear and splitting my grape on a rock. Days go by slow when you're having a bad day at the office or in the classroom. ORGNAME is suspended when you're so miserable that you would almost rather die than continue through the rest of training It was a different sort of feeling felt in life. Hadn't had if before. but I miss it. I'd never felt so alive. What we take for granted in life: friends, our favorite book, the faithful German Shepherd, a home cooked meal, a grassy lawn, a drive down a country road that reminds you of your childhood. those are given new meaning. The feeling of infinite pride, accomplishment, belonging, knowing that you live your life not for the boss, not for others, not for money, not for possession, and knowing that you cannot be defeated. I felt that during ORGNAME ORGNAME graduation. That is what I will remember and cherish in life. Throwing the "greatest party", making $000 grand a year vs $00, driving an ORGNAME ORGNAME. What does that crap mean if you don't truly own yourself? Like those who fawn over celebrities or drive expensive cars that their ego thrives on but their families at home cannot afford. They will never know the meaning of life. I know that I may never be the investment banker that all college kids know they will be, but I will have a rich life. I will not be the movie star that everyone knows they will be, but I know that I will be loved by those who matter to me. I look forward to the future. 
__label__label1 This is my first year at ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I feel nervous and confused about what is to come. I am not accustomed to all this work and it is really making me worried because I cannot keep up in all my classes. For one, I have so much to do in all my classes, and two, I live off-campus and it takes at least an hour to get back to my apartment. My roommates a complete slob and he leaves his stuff everywhere around the house; just yesterday I notice he is been eating out of some fried chicken that was left over from last saturday and has been sitting out on the counter for 0 days!             I also want to keep up with my friends, but it is so hard because there is so much work. They're always asking me to go party with them on the weekends, but that is not something that I like to do. I don't drink and I don't plan on to and I am not interested in meeting girls because I am currently happy in my relationship. I've been going out with her for 00 months and one day. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me; sometimes I feel as if she cares for me then I care for myself. I've never felt like this before, specially with a member of the opposite sex. I don't have good looks to attract girls, but from what people tell me, I have a good personality. I listen to what others have to say. I listen to their problems and try to help them with their problems - I am not just saying this to suck up to a psychology professor, but I really do this. I am majoring in psychology; it is what I really want to do. Back to my girlfriend, she is currently going to ORGNAME and will be transferring to LOCNAME next year. What really bugs me though is how whenever I go to see her, my friends are always bugging me about Hey man, are you going to smash her?" and my answer is "NO. " You can call me old-fashioned but I believe in abstinence. I am a virgin. It bugs others, but it doesn't bug me. I don't get how people can make love to multiple girls and not feel dirty about it. I know I would. I would never have sex with my girlfriend before we get married. I want to have that respect for her and just restrain myself from that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love her. I want to make love to her, but I am not going to. I have morals. I was raised in a culture where dating was frowned upon. My parents had no problems with it as long as I didn't do anything - and I don't. I really like this girl, and I have thought of a future with her in the long run and I do not want to compromise that. I just wish that she would be here with me. As you can see, she means a lot to me and she is on my mind a lot. My major is psychology, but eventually I want to become a pediatrician or maybe even a psychiatrist - I don't know yet. It worries me that I will have to stay in school for another 0 years and that is a real long time but I feel that it is worth it, so I do not want to give up. I will try my best. Now I am sitting here not knowing how to word this paper because I am so accustomed to High School writing with 0 paragraphs and an introductory and conclusion, but the assignment was to simply state my feelings - so I am. It is raining outside right now. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I have classes. It would not be fun walking drenched to philosophy 000 with Professor PROPNAME. Philosophy also seems like an interesting class for me. Professor PROPNAME is hilarious and is awesome to listen to (as you are). The rats with altered hypothalamuses were hilarious and they really made me think about all the technology that is out there. I know I am doing the right thing by taking all the classes I am to pursue my career. I am scared that my grades won't be able to cut it though. All these classes require a lot of reading, and reading isn't exactly my best subject. I am trying my best to keep up and continue with all the reading and continue with turning in my assignments on time. It is really hard but I think I should be all right. I am especially worried about this class, because the lectures are completely different from the textbook and I have to keep up on both and well - I am just a confused little man. My times running out and my brain is struggling to squeeze words out to finish up this assignment. I also have a chemistry exam tomorrow. YES tomorrow. So hopefully I'll do good at that because it seems relatively easy. I miss my parents. They are back in LOCNAME. They don't want me to go visit them because they don't want me adding mileage to the car. So I am stuck in  LOCNAME til Thanksgiving. I'll go home, eat turkey, and come back sick. Yes, I do listen in class. 
__label__label0 I am eating a ORGNAME's bar with almonds. I told myself that I would only eat one little square of it, but as I can see, that didn't happen. You would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry. For more sweets. That's interesting.      As I'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on ORGNAME instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words I've already typed, so I have to keep going back and deleting and starting over. Annoying.    Over the Labor Day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way. On that note, I used to not like having a birthday so near a quote "holiday" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and I wouldn't be able to get together with all of them. Now that I've entered COLLEGE (smile), I've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday. To spend with special people (bigger smile). Anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) I celebrated my 00th birthday with my family and my BEST friend.     My mom used to attend ORGNAME ORGNAME, in fact, both of my parents did. Unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home. Anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years.    My dad is a self-employed architect. He used to work for a large corporation in LOCNAME, but hardly had time to have a life. A life away from work, that is. My mom likes to say that when I was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - AHHHH! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: "Look, there's your Daddy. "  Now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons.    My little brother, PROPNAME, was born when I was nearing 00 years old. Currently he is seven years old, in second grade. He came as a HUGE surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile. But obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong. He is very active, and shows so much love that I don't know how such a little body can produce it. Right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, PROPNAME.    Speaking of PROPNAME, I met him in high school. We both attended ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, a magnet school in LOCNAME LOCNAME. By chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year. That was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together Project Graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation. Actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 0000 students total; around 000 in my class. I didn't get to what I was saying, but I guess I'll leave the juicy stuff for next time. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that I know I have to do this. Just got back from school and had lunch. My whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. I cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. I've left the TV on. I always like to watch something as I eat. Something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. It's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. I've always wondered about the concept of time. How it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. I have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. I'm not getting old so much as I had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. Headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. I was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to PROPNAME PROPNAME to do some shopping. My boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. What a nasty shock!. At least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. I left the TV on way too loud. Funny how I sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others I love background noises. Leave the TV on just for "company". Talk about true desperation. CSI is on. Love the show. Absolutely fascinating. I am such a TV addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. Got an exam coming up on Monday, got to start studying for that. Hope it's not too tough. Gosh, I really miss home and family. It's tough being away in a foreign land. I can't wait to get back to LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I am so looking forward to my trip in LOCNAME at the end of the year. I am so excited about LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. It was hot out today. I'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. The ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. I'm glad I missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. Like winter so much better. I'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in LOCNAME. Have to admit that I don't really know what else to talk about. I just know that I want to shower after this but knowing me, I'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the CSI marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so I can continue the moving process. My new apartment needs a lot of TLC before it will be in tip top shape. Then again, only about three more months till I leave the states and am back on the road to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME then LOCNAME. This year has been a most trying one. But I know that I am a stronger and wiser person for it. I've been through so much in life, but I know there's so much more. I'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in ORGNAME before I leave and a family friend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. Maybe I won't need/want that fan after all. There's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. I am almost there, just 0 more minutes left. I really need to focus my time and attention on what I'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. I'm actually speaking as I type. Is that normal? Or more precisely, that's normal for me. I wonder what Professor PROPNAME would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. Ok. back to CSI. 
__label__label0 I feel so blessed to be here right now. the game tonight was so fun. I can't believe that we won 00-0. that's such an incredible win. poor north LOCNAME guys. They must feel pretty embarrassed. I feel so content here and settled even though I've only been here a couple of weeks. I think that I am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home. I miss judd so much. the time we get to spend together is never enough. its funny to me how I haven't missed my parents at all but I think about and miss judd all the time. I just love the way he makes me feel, so warm and so complete. I'm so glad that I have friends here like oshley and that I totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate. I'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we're still good friends. I was so surprised when I saw him on the jumbotron tonight. I feel so proud of him. I can't stop thinking about how lucky I feel to be here. I just love it here and can't wait till judd gets here. I think I want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here. Its just so amazing. the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing. living in new braunfels was such a bubble. this feels more like the real world. I know that people say college is still a bubble and I think they're right, but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels. I miss high school, but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown. at the game last night, I felt a little sad that I wasn't down there on the track cheering. now that judd and I were together, part of me wishes I could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship - the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader. it would've been so much fun to have that sort of experience!  I'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because I feel like they aren't taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they've got down there. those were the best times of my life thus far. I know that better are sure to come in my years here at LOCNAME, but I just wish that I could go back, just for one Friday night, and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd. it makes me so sad that I probably won't ever get to perform like that again. my dancing and cheering days are over and I just want them back. its not that I miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program, I just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans. I thrive off of that and now I feel a little empty since I don't get to do it anymore, and I especially feel it when I see the new girls down there on the track. I feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that I'm in college because all I ever talked about in high school was how I couldn't wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student. granted I definitely don't miss the drama of high school, I do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading.  the more I keep thinking about this the more sad I feel. I think the biggest problem is how much I miss judd. we spent so much time together this summer and I just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever I needed him. I can't believe I fell in love with him. he's just an amazing guy. the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his Christianity. its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and I was too young to question it and now its just a part of who I am and I'm so thankful for that. but judd didn't grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he can't prove really is there. I think its a matter of pride. The idea of giving himself to someone else that he doesn't really know is there doesn't settle well with him. or maybe its a trust issue. Or maybe both. its just hard because I can't really understand how he can NOT have belief, and he doesn't understand how I CAN. oh man I have a lot of homework this weekend. I really have to finish it all tomorrow so I can go home and see judd. I can't wait to see him tomorrow. I wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me. I can't wait for him to come to school up here and be with me! that will totally complete me here. I don't know if I'm complete without him. I've never felt dependent on someone like that before. well I think my time is almost up. in conclusion, I feel so amazed that I'm actually here. I miss my friends who aren't here, and I especially miss judd. I want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer. 
__label__label0 As I sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, I feel as if I don't belong here, in this setting. I'm not usually the completely studious type so I'm just trying this library thing out. It's really deathly quiet and I'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me. I feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting. I hope people around me aren't annoyed by this "tapping" as I am. I'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least I'm next to the window. I picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored. People watching is fun. it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and I often wonder how different it is from my own. I haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since I've moved up here to LOCNAME and just now, I realize that I indeed do miss it. I think I'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on. next time, I should remember to bring a jacket; I feel like I'm turning into a humansicle. but I don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here. it's quite a walk. I really should learn how to use the bus system here. I'm used to having the comfort of my car. the comfort I've had for four years. I miss it. I went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started. it's not because I missed home or I was homesick or anything. I've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much. like this summer, my 0 weeks overseas, I don't think I even thought about my family or home-life all that much. As horrible as that sounds, I'm not the type to miss my family or anything. anyway, I just went home this weekend because I felt that my dorm room was too bland and I wanted to bring up more stuff. I ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that I should have thrown away. instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area. it looks so much better. I also got a new webcam. my mother had one at home that I wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one. My mother's a funny person. She came to the states during her college years about 00-something years ago. I wonder how her college experience was. It must have been hard. I can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying. I've experienced it. still, she managed pretty well, I suspect. she's just that type of person. she has a really strange accent though in her English. Normally, Asian people have a really "fobbish" horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different. It's not a perfect English accent but it sounds slightly European. I don't know why. My mom is a very peculiar person. Oh, going back to the webcam thing. I think one day I was using her computer at home and I looked at her picture folder. There were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits. I almost fell out of my chair laughing. My mom is so cute. I believe she chats more than I do online to her friends. We've never chatted before but now that I'm not home, we've started to talk online through ORGNAME messenger. It's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but I'm sure I'll be accustomed to it soon. My mom's awesome. I wonder how many of my friend's moms chat online to them. NO ONE. well, no one that I've met anyway. Now I've run out of things to say so I'm slowly gazing around this room. I'm next to a beigish wall. I don't think I enjoy the color beige too much. I wish I had better posture. typing on the computer makes me slouch. sitting back while reading makes me slouch. eating makes me slouch. I think I'm just a natural sloucher. I want to grow at least two more inches though. I look taller if I'd stand up straight but it's so hard. I also heard stretching makes you taller. I should try that sometime. I always say I'll start things and never do. Or usually I start things that I never finish. I wonder if it's a kind of disorder. there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old. I should go flip through some of them before I leave. they look interesting. I like that old book smell. I don't know why. it'll probably make me sneeze. someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other. I should have smiled or something. I feel so rude and mean. I think I look mean when I feel emotionless or I'm not making any faces on purpose. my mom says Asians naturally look angry all the time. maybe it's true. I should smile more often but then I feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself. oh well. it's college now, I'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway. time's up, I'm done. 
__label__label0 Wow, I have some pizza stuck in my tooth. Aw, why did that song have to end, it was good. the AC is really loud. Man, I like shrek 0. tonight, I'm breaking the habit tonight, I like PROPNAME PROPNAME, she's so talented. man, I'm so bad at spelling. I haven't heard this, oh, yeah, it's by clay aiken, or maybe it isn't. Oh well. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was probably from LOCNAME LOCNAME, I'm from LOCNAME about thirty miles north of LOCNAME. I saw PROPNAME a couple days ago. She's got curly hair. Movie Night, um I don't know. I'm supposed to by typing what I am thinking. I'm talking with PROPNAME my roommate. She is wearing a hat. I have a hat just like it. It's in my closet on top on a shelf. PROPNAME is leaving now. I shall say bye to her. Ok, now that that is over. I am going out to lunch with this girl from Christians on Campus. Sounds like it would be fun. Her name is PROPNAME and she just graduated, I think from this college in LOCNAME but she is here for just the semester. Only 0 minutes have gone by. Wow, this is taking forever. I have chemistry oops, mistake. I don't like commercials on the radio, why couldn't they just play music commercial free. My folder is blue. I finished all my psychology reading (all of chapter three). I learned way too much info on the nervous system. It is going to take forever to study for the test. I'm glad there is a lot of info in the chapter though, because I'm going to med school and will need that info. I keep making typos probably because I'm typing too fast. Oh, I have ice-cream in the freezer. Mmmm. It is a blue bell ice cream sandwich. I like ORGNAME's. Ah, yay, another commercial free hour of music. YAY. I like PROPNAME PROPNAME. My Happy Ending is a good song. Everyone criticizes her for not being "punk enough. "  I laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists. They should just appreciate the music. I think by saying that I was being a hypocrite because I was criticizing the people who criticize. Does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite. Deep, huh?  I'm wearing contacts. I like my sunglasses. They are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors. Wow, I am only have way done. Hey, maybe that means I'm optimistic. I am such a bad speller. I spend way to much time thinking about school. I'm such a nerd. Everyone else goes out and parties and I stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours. But I do tend to watch a lot of TV, wait, I haven't been watching much TV during this past week at LOCNAME. Only about 0 hour per day. I'm so proud of myself. I can't believe that I haven't procrastinated this assignment. I don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts. I guess I'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice. I bought new caprice. My mom just washed them. I went to the B. E. S. T. thing sponsored by the business school. It was so much fun. We went to the lake. Hello, PROPNAME wrote me a note. My printer is off. I can't think of anything else to write about. I was valedictorian, I was nervous when I said my speech. YAY for 0. 0 ORGNAME. For having such a high ORGNAME, you would think that I wouldn't be so scatterbrained. I think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing. I have to sign up to do that psychology experiment. I want to do the prescreening. PROPNAME says that it takes two hours. I want to get it over with and not procrastinate. I have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it. I like this song, and that song, well, maybe not. I want to go so sleep. I went to sleep early last night 0:00. Oh, this is that singer PROPNAME PROPNAME (I am such a bad speller). I liked Spiderman 0. I have always been a fan of stuff like that: Spiderman, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, etc. I like Smallville on the ORGNAME. It is a good show. What else. I can't think of anything else. Ok, I have about 0 and a half minutes left. What else should I do. I have chemistry in an hour but I should leave in 0/0 an hour because I want to get a good seat in class. I'm so blind, even with my contacts. I don't want to sit in the very front row because then I will strain my neck having to look straight up at the Professor. I have Professor Laude. He is very funny. I went to a discussion session at 00. Wait, it was at 00 and ended at 00AM. I think is was fairly productive. I'm a business major. Did I mention that. I'm also pre-med. I want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist. That is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor. It will be able to be cool to say that though. My mom was a doctor. My dad has a PhD, so he is in a sense a doctor. He is asst. Dean of the ORGNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME. I like this song. It is by Maroon 0. PROPNAME, my older brother, he is 00, I think, likes this song. He has this CD and will never let me borrow it. He called me last night and was  
__label__label0 Today has been a terrible day here in LOCNAME LOCNAME, because it is all ugly and humid outside. I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family. My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me. He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in LOCNAME and that I can't come down for the homecoming football game. I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud. I need time to think and be alone. My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework. It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren't towards me. Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing. I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand. This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and "party music",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music. I don't mind that music either, but I prefer my country. Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn't listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something's, I have this hyper personality, and I have an "Irish persons'" chin. I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face. I have a bad habit of smelling things. I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer. I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something's. I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized. It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn't care if I got dirty, or if I didn't take a bath; I hated taking baths. I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn't feel like it has been 00 minutes, it seems a lot faster. I thought that LOCNAME was going to be a SUPER SCARY school, but it isn't because I have awesome classes and the environment here is awesome, everyone here is friendly. I  
__label__label0 I'm a little worried these past few days because of the work study award. I know that I have a certain time limit to get a job and I'm trying to get a job but itORGNAME so hard. It's even harder when you've never had a job experience before. And my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job. I know what I need to do, she just needs to lay off of me sometimes. That's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister, she'll be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what's going on in my life. It's not always bad because I don't do anything that will disappoint my parents. The other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me, she can boss me around. It's not like I'm her slave or anything; it's just that I don't like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it. I like being my own person, making my own decisions. If only I had been able to do that since I was a kid so I wouldn't have so much problems now. Ever since I could remember, my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor. Any doctor is ok as long as I made it. Well, what they want has followed me into my college life. The only reason why I would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one. So now I don't really know what I want to major in. I had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want. I'm just so obedient. I don't know why but I'm just like PROPNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Always obeying what others says. So, my college life has been ok so far. I like the campus a lot and I also like Jester because it's in the center of everything that I need. The PCL is across the street, and the gym is adjacent to it also. The food is right down on the 0nd floor of Jester or downstairs at ORGNAME. Very convenient. The only bad thing about it so far is that I have a TV and that means trouble. I have become addicted to the show ORGNAME's ORGNAME. I have to watch it everyday. Let's see. It comes on ch. 00 at 00-00pm, ch. 00 at 00-00:00am, ch. 00 at 0-0am. So I stay up late just to watch my Three's Company. I know it's very silly especially since on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I have a 0am class. But somehow I manage to get up and not feel tired at all. Amazing isn't it?  But it probably will wear off soon. Another thing I have to mention, I am getting very tired of eating American food for every meal, I need something from my culture. I need my rice!  So, I had a very wonderful Labor Day Weekend because I went to LOCNAME to visit my new baby cousin, PROPNAME. He's 0 weeks old and o so adorable!!  And PROPNAME's almost 0 year old brother is also cute. Whenever we say anything to him all he says is 'I know' or 'I don't know' and laugh. Just so adorable. And when I had to leave, he was all sad. When I picked up my bag, he took it from me and put it back on the floor so I won't leave. I could talk forever about PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But I didn't really like the LOCNAME whether because it was raining the whole time so when we drove anywhere bugs would hit the window and front bumper. So by the end of the trip, the front of the car was smothered with bug guts. YUCK!  hehe =)  Oh no!  My time is almost up!  Well, I guess I can spend the remaining time saying my good byes. Goodbye, chao. Write to you laters. Got only a few more seconds. It has been good writing down my feelings, getting it all out of my system. I feel lighter. OK, BYE!!!!!!!  
__label__label0 This is kind of weird. I never set aside just some time for me to type and write and think. It's crazy that my thoughts are not really coherent. tiffany is typing next to me--her music is  loud and kind of weird. I'm not a big fan of rap. wow look at how the font looks smaller after  you don't capitalize. tiff's talking to me and going into the bathroom. Stupid homework. I am  typing but I don't know what I'm thinking about. man it's so loud in our room. she's yelling at  me. she wants me to finish my work so I can talk to her. silly girl. the TV is kind of annoying I  want to turn it off but it's so far away. college is making me lazy. that reminds me of PROPNAME's  inferno. I can hear the wretch is that how you spell it? wrench clanking in the background. tiffany is struggling to put our brand spanking new fluffy toilet seat onto the crappy and dirty  jester toilet that who knows how many people have urinated in gross!! I realize that even  though I am writing my thoughts down as I type, some of my thoughts are not being recorded  in this stream of consciousness writing because my mind is going crazy and I can think about a  billion things at once but I can't type it all fast enough. stupid fingers! type faster! type faster!  this is such a crazy assignment. I love how unstructured college is. I love how you can do  whatever you want and no one gives a damn. it's pretty spiffy! some girls is getting her face  redone for plastic surgery. I'm glad I'm not heinously ugly or I'd be tempted to get some plastic  surgery done too. crazy. crazy reminds me of a song. can't remember which. man I kind of miss  high school. those days of knowing everyone in all of your classes--- I'm sad that they are  over. now I walk into class and I'm lucky if I know one person. got to meet some friends. but  PROPNAME is kind of holding me back. I love him but I don't know if I can take his clingininess! he's  such a sweet guy but I wonder what it would be like to be single again. wow look at how much  I've typed. I love my new ibook. it's so cute. I just want to look at it all day. how cute is it!  right. dang I'm weird. noises in the background are distracting me now. too bad I can't reach  over real fast and turn off the stupid TV. I really think that TV dumbs people down. interesting. my fingers look weird when I type. they look like little spiders. ha-ha. website! that's the weirdest  word. weird. indweirdo. too bad jaya and I aren't really friends anymore. she's in psycho with  me though--maybe we can rekindle out old friendship. PROPNAME was so mean to me. oral interp  man-- at least I made some more friends. don't need friends like that anyways. JESUS!! LOVER  OF MY SOUL! JESUS! I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO!!! dang I wish that I could see PROPNAME now. I know  that faith is what makes Him real to us, but wouldn't it be cool of they could make some PROPNAME  bears to hug when you're sad? I miss my parents a lot. actually, I just miss my mom!! *sigh*. it's  all good. PROPNAME the printer. ha-ha bio II. such a good class to go to. I love the learning, hate  the quizzes and tests. high school was hard. waking up early to study, staying up late to study. bummer! and all to get into a college to repeat the cycle all over again. man it's weird not to  have my parents around! why do people have rhinoplasties? they're so nasty!  ccccccccccccccrunk is what that is! tupac. why do people die? I so do not even get it. I think  about death in that it's scary. I believe in Jesus, so will I definitely go to heaven? I'm such a  reasoning person that I wonder if there is a heaven sometimes. but that's sin. purgatory  according that PROPNAME inferno website is where I'm going. yay! will see the Son and the Father  one day. I need to use the bathroom. dangit. still have 0 minutes left. my hands are kind of  sweaty. gross! man what a loser. this girl is 00 on TV and wants a nose job to feel better about  herself. that's so crazy. why are people so low self-esteem? like ling. dang that girl acts like  she's all that, but she has no self esteem at all! it's all an act, a facade. yay! my battery is  charged up to 00%. the % button is always above the 0. weird, eh? eh? mission! that reminds me  of PROPNAME and mission trips. I wish I had gone to LOCNAME LOCNAME with everyone this year. I almost  feel like I let God down. your love is amazing. your love is amazing. Your love is amazing to me. my grammar and punctuation sucks. man I wonder what she's doing. haven't talked to that girl  in forever. I can't believe I've been typing for almost 00 minutes! this is nuts. ha-ha PROPNAME  from full house. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is so hot. gosh' can't believe he's marrying PROPNAME PROPNAME. wonder what sofa and PROPNAME are doing at ORGNAME right now. ORGNAME-- that's the root of all of  ORGNAME's problems. that's why he's so clingy and insecure. I want to help him. but how? man  these apples are cute!!! the little apple logo makes me feel all warm and fuzzy! ahhhhhh the  door is not locked! tiff forgot to lock it. got to lock it after I'm done with this thing. I'm getting  tired now. I want to watch love actually. that's such a freaking' cute movie. freaky Friday. ha-ha  PROPNAME PROPNAME and her weird boobs. no way can a teenage girl grow boobs that fast! why are  guys so obsessed with boobs? freaks me out. anyways let's change the topic. I wonder if dr. PROPNAME or his TAs will read this. poor people their eyes must be boggling out by now from  all the reading. tiff is drumming on the toilet seat. gross! she put my stuff on that dirty grout- stricken floor. the time is going by freakishly fast. dude it's already 00 minutes and counting. I  kind of don't want to stop doing this. maybe I'll keep an online diary just for myself to do this  everyday. how do you know who you will marry? how do you know you won't get sick of them?  000. scary day. PROPNAME's birthday. the phone is ringing. the door opens. flip flops are dirty. I feel  like a loser sometimes. but this is not a cry for help. I love you JESUS! hahha I hope whoever  reads this doesn't think I'm a loser. the little AIM man looks funny. I can't wait to read this after  I'm done with everything. I want to see what I was thinking. Kim basinger and this dude are on  TV for this new movie. who sometimes movies really scare me. like PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in the  new movies. tiff is wailing. she forgot about a homework assignment. uh-oh. doesn't sound  good. my tummy feels weird. I think I'm getting fat. out!! peace 
__label__label1 Seriously in my mind right now I have so many levels of thought that I can easily access by simply starting to think about something, Everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once I analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what I think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is, because everything has its specific purpose. A lot of things that I thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our (human) use and that is what they are specifically there for. Everything is for us. Humans. Everything. We utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can. This alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade, making sure that on one takes any along the way. If someone takes our lemonade, we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much? When and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back? But if someone drinks it then we can't get it back, so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are? Notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us. Even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking. Controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do. Basically, this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person. The more people widely accept a thought, the more it is thought to be what we think as "normal" but just because a thought isn't in everyone's mind, then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy? In our minds, social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are "weird" but this is the main problem with our world. If everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because. well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time, please pardon my language but I felt I must stress the importance of the statement. May I please stress it again? Damn, There I did it. There is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why. They must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be. People that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed. I see the irony in my statements above because I said simply that we must accept the world for what it is, but here's the thing. I have personally not yet learned to do this because I still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that I wish to change or eradicate: the fact that people don't just accept the world and people in their "out of the ordinary" state of minds for just the way that it is. Simply put. the way that it is. THE WAY THAT IT IS. If I could understand that then I believe that I will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach. I am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than I ever thought I could be. I don't think there are any major flaws in our world that I cannot look at with an open mind and. accept, if you will. I say "if you will" because I feel that "accept" may not properly convey what it is that I am trying to express. By accept, I mean. look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why? well who knows and it is okay not to know. I need not know the meaning of everything but I have a deep appreciation for it. There it is. I HAVE A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR IT. I was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world. I appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people's personalities and I choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind. No one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it. I feel it with everything that I do and I only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself. Everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities (without bearing harm to others of course, because that is the definite point where a specific line is crossed), and this is simply our duty to the world. 
__label__label0 I have just returned to my room from my biology class. PROPNAME forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so I cannot study them at the moment. I am very excited because I got a full meal for only $0. 00! I got a free coke, a free corner of a sandwich, 0 free candy bars and I bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 0 bucks, which by the way was really tasty. It is in my refrigerator now because I have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago. Well tomorrow at 0:00 I will be done with classes for the week and I am thinking of driving home for the night to LOCNAME LOCNAME. It is a three hour drive, but I am not really homesick, just feel kind of lost. The reason I'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer. See the one I have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three ORGNAME representatives/technical experts the battery will not charge. SO they have sent me a entire system replacement, after first trying to merely replace the battery. Which is what should happen because when one orders a $0000 system they would hope it would work. So my next class is in about an hour and a half. It is biology which is interesting to me for the most part. It is my major, but I have been planning on changing it. I chose it mostly because what I was interested in was medicine and I wanted to go to medical school after college. Now, I am not quite sure that is what is for me, although it was never a sure thing. Now I was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where I could take more classes of interest to me and also Spanish which I recently tested out of 00 hours!! I could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school I decide on. There are so many decisions to be made. Now that I have finally chosen a college. I still am wondering about that decision. I mean I Have always loved LOCNAME, my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer. Maybe that is the problem too much?? I just sort of feel like I'm not fitting in, but then again isn't that what UT is about, being an individual? Well, I definitely like to be an individual and my own self, but I would like some friends, a group who'll call and see what I'm doing, call to hang out. I mean I have been here only 00 days and I'm worried? Well not yet, I am still giving it time. But I just feel so down on myself and anti-social. The only people I have really hung around are from my hometown. Not that it's all bad, I just was so ready to branch out into something NEW! So going home just seems like a good answer at the time, I even thought maybe I chose the wrong college, but how can I say that when I've been here not even two weeks. At home, making friends was always easy. I was the center of focus there. Had everything, here there is so many that I am, well, unnoticed. That in itself is a change. But then I think isn't everyone else going through the same thing? Then if everyone else is, then why don't we just get together? Well I guess the world does not work that way. But I have not given up yet, there is still hope. The first football game is Saturday and I know that will reinforce my love for the school. I loved going to the games when I wasn't a student at this school. Maybe I can meet some friends then. So it is labor day weekend coming up. Mostly I need to be studying, but that is what school is about. I think we may float the river, so that will be fun. I have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight, but I have a study session for Bio at 0pm, ,hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim, change and make it over to PROPNAME. I just am not sure how to work it all out. drive, walk, ride the bus. I don't live in a city and things are so different here. The town I am from, I didn't even live in the city limits. Hhmmmm. but I really need to workout. I am not going to get fat in college. I need to lose pounds right now, not gain them. But food is everywhere, I guess you can see by the free food. Well maybe I can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking. But the candy bars aren't good. Ok, before next class I need to read some bio and some psychology, but what I really want to do is lay in my bed, listen to music, watch TV maybe take a nap?. Nope not here in the college world. Wow, I like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing. 
__label__label1 I really need to study for chemistry, but I just remembered that this assignment was due. I  would have done it earlier, but my computer has been giving me so many problems. First  all these warnings about "you have spyware and adware" started coming up and then it started  working really slow--it took 00 minutes to open up the internet!!  Then after a while it wouldn't  even do that--it just sat there!  So I tried to shut it down and it still didn't do anything--but if I  tried to start a program, it said "This program cannot open because the system is shutting  down. "  So I unplugged it and let the battery run out. Computers are so stupid. But I guess we  couldn't live without them. I really hope I don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow. I'm really  nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that I don't  completely understand. My roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the ORGNAME--she  calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--I don't know how she does it!!  Studying for 00 minutes makes me feel like I need a break--she stays there for hours!!  She's  really sweet though. I so happy I got good roommates (yes--that's plural--I have 0  roommates--I'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as I thought it would be)  0 of my  roommates are really nice. The other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's  always at her boyfriend's house. That's kind of rude to her parents though--I mean--they're  paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here. The only thing I know about  her is her name really. That's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time  anymore. When we first moved in she didn't have a Ethernet cord so I said she could do her  add/drops on my pc. But then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on MY  printer--with MY ink) so at least that's not happening any more. PROPNAME PROPNAME lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open tonight. That made me so sad--I LOVE  PROPNAME PROPNAME--he has to be the sexiest guy ever!  I met him last year and the Tennis Masters  Series in LOCNAME and he signed my shirt--me and 0 of my friends had made shirts that spelled  out PROPNAME--he and his coach really liked them!!  But I really wanted him to win--he won the  Open last year and that was his first so I really wanted him to defend it. Oh well. The guy he  lost to was playing really good. He played the same type of game as PROPNAME though. They were  calling him a Swedish PROPNAME PROPNAME, but he'll never be PROPNAME PROPNAME--he wasn't cute enough. Chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester. I'm not really sure if I want to  major in biology any more. I think it might just be too much science for me. I thought I could  handle it, but I just don't know anymore. I know majoring in biology will probably help me  make a good score on the ORGNAME, though. I really want to get into med school. I want to be a  pediatrician. It's just so much school though. OY!  But I think it'll pay off. I really want to do  something with kids and I could do that and make money at the same time. I mean--it's that or  teaching right?  and teaching is definitely NOT on my list of things I want to do. My mom is a  teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve!  She works all the time--sometimes  she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 0th and 0th graders. I  mean--it's probably worse with older kids right?  I don't know--I just couldn't handle it--I'd  feel like I deserved more. Chemistry time. 
__label__label1      How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework. This week is going to be pretty busy. It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. All the teachers should use the same service. This would make it much easier for students to keep up. My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology. I need to find out what I missed. That class is going to suck. I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away. I hate writing. I hate typing. It is hard to write down everything you think. Our minds work 0 or 0 times faster than one can type or speak. So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 0 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. I'm glad my spider bite went away. It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it. They gave me a shot in my ass. It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. It just sucked that it was on my face. It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days. Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. I spend much time alone now that I moved away. Luckily I enjoy being by myself. It is nice to have the peace and quiet. The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know. I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played. I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. It seems barbaric to use ones instincts  
__label__label0 Well I am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering I hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. Too bad that I have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study I will be leading for kappa that I have little time to rest I really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because I have so much going on that I feel guilty if I am not always being productive. I know that I need to take time every day just to sit with God and tell him what is going on in my mind. So that's what I want to do with this exercise I am going to type everything I think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to God. I hate that I feel like I constantly need to be watching my money, or what I eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like I am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? I know I human, and that I am sinful and that I can't do anything on my own. So I don't know why I get disappointed in my failures, why should I expect anything else??? I feel pretty guilty about how much time I put into some of my relationships as well, like I wish I was there for Lauren F. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. Please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. I also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, I need you to make me aware of when I start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when I start to keep a constant tab on how much I spend or what people owe me. Lord I want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something I deserve because I know that I do not!   I also know that I need to take a nap this afternoon if I want to get any work done later so I pray that I would be able to do that as well. I have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. YOU and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. Lord I want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. I feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when I can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. I really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  I hate that I was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, I am also so worried about PROPNAME, MP, and PROPNAME, I just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you Lord, and understand your love for them. I wish I knew what to expect on this PHL test coming up on Thursday, but there I go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. I am worried that I am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as I should be but I know that I am doing the best I can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. I am so glad I got to spend time with ford this weekend and I really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in LOCNAME because I know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. But I know he was supposed to be here this weekend and I am so glad that he got to talk to PROPNAME last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. I feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason I am really upset that the tuna fish I bought and that 0up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $0???? come on PROPNAME you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly I am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but I know that I need to be really giving that to you and I really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. I am really hot so I had to go turn on the fan. I wonder when becca and PROPNAME are getting back, is it wrong that I kind of like that they aren't around right now? Why is it that I like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? I am kind of worried about PROPNAME maybe liking me, I really don't want him to, because I really love having him as a friend and I really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason I've been getting that vibe lately so I really hope that I can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. Man that 0up stuff I got is disgusting!!! why do I always try those things. Healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. I really hate that I am always feeling like I need to be repaid when I do something for someone I mean seriously! why can't I just give out of love and show like grace like PROPNAME did to us??? I am really excited about this PSYCH class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. I am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 00 hours of sleep I got on Saturday I really need to get rest because I know I don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! I just wish I would enjoy it I pray that I could have a peace so that I could sleep right now. 
__label__label0      Man today was a really long day. I'm a so tired but I have all this crap to do still. mostly calculus. I don't know why I took 000D. its so freaking hard. I hope I'll do okay because I just have to. I signed up for tutoring but I don't know how much that'll help. I like this cd I'm listening to. I've listened to it a million times but still like it. man I'm really upset that alias isn't coming on this season. I love that show. It was one thing I was looking forward to this semester. I wish I could be like LOCNAME and kick butt. but instead I'm really boring. man I am so freaking tired. the bathroom has gotten really disgusting. I don't want to be the only one to clean it but I don't want to be the only one to complain that its dirty. I hate cleaning toilets. I mean it would be okay if it were at home because that's like our toilet and I kind of know the germs around. but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek I just can't think about it with out cringing. college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to. I guess I'll get used to it. Its going okay so far. I mean its fun and all but I don't know. I really really miss home. Its weird not coming home to your family everyday. I've met some really cool people but I still miss my old friends. but I'm getting used to going places by myself. Woo hoo I'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom. sheehs its only been 0 minutes. I don't know how much more I can type. This is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha I am typing what I am thinking so hey. my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping. Wait I missed my favorite song on the cd. Oh well. I wish asthma were here with me. We could do some awesome stuff together. but amrita seems really cool we've had great convos. but I'm still scared to make new close friends like I loved my friends from hs. We were such GOOD friends. Making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over. Its hard for me I'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere. I feel really  alone sometimes in a room full of people but I guess that's natural. wow its only been 0 min and 00 seconds. but I shouldn't complain  this is better than doing limits in calculus. lord calculus. I'm so worried I have to do good I have to. After this I should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk. tomorrow is discussion so it shouldn't be so bad. but I'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which isn't good when I'm totally clueless. Its embarrassing. but I guess I'm not the only one. Some people didn't know the answers either. The only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if I knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. He's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though I can be boring haha. I think he feels bad for me because I'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . So many friends and places to go. I should keep my self busy so I won't get so lonely. I'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. I want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. I have second thoughts about everything I have no idea why. I wonder where my roommate went. She works out everyday. Its inspiring I should too. I'll go to the gym. Haha I'll try who knows if I actually will. I went once and really liked it but I just have to find time. It seems like I have boatloads of work. but college is good. I'll get through it. I just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. Who knows I still have at least 0 years . I'm so sleepy. 0 more minutes of this and then calculus. No time to sleep. Ooh I need to watch ORGNAME tonight. I missed last night but PROPNAME PROPNAME was there. It might of been interesting even though I'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but I think there's some validity to it. sigh. I'm going home this weekend. I'm excited. I'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. Haha that's what's cool about being Indian. parents can always find some other Indian kid to drive you home. oh well. I'm so tired there's only 0 minutes to go. This was actually cool and stress relieving. you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out. oooh asthma just imed me. I haven't talked to her in a while. damn she hangs out with matt PROPNAME now. I find that to be so freaking funny. who would of thought? anyways man all I can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha I like dreaming lately I have weird dreams last time I had this nightmare 
__label__label1      I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, "yeah I party", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 0 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 0th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about "friends" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch "joey" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, PROPNAME, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 00, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the "brady bunch" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 0000. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 00th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 00th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 0th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 00 or 00, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  PROPNAME. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 0  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later 
__label__label0      I am sitting in my room. There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. The sound of musics floats in from the next room. Paint smells intoxicate me. I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment. The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. I wonder whey she looks so upset about it. The air conditioner begins to run. I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. The phone rings next to me. I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit. I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. Funny how the time just slips away like that. You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. It makes my sheets look pretty though. The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. Everything is starting to fade. My mind and eyes start to slow down. Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. I want it to slow down. Everything should be slower these days. I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays. I watch TV until I feel like eating something. I can smell my mama start to cook dinner. She always makes such good food for me. I smell cheese melting on something. I think it might be broccoli. But you can't smell brocolli. I keep spelling that differently. I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. How funny. Things like that when they happen. LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. I realized I haven't typed for the whole 00 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five. I think I will try to do it again in a minute. I hope this isn't too bad. 
__label__label0 well I guess it'll be good to get this out of the way. Let's see what's on my mind. ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music. this seems like it could get boring. hmm. maybe that's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring. anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on. much better. well I'm officially pledging phi delt tonight. I'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I'm pretty excited. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. john's pledging with me and I guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends. this is kind of nice. this is a good way to clear my thoughts up. I've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head. what kind of phrase is that. clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it. ok I can't talk about one thing for very long. wow this time is going pretty fast. it doesn't seem like I've been writing long at all and I'm a quarter of the way done. ok well let's accomplish something productive here. what do I need to do today? I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight. hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes. I didn't bring my dress shoes I don't think. that's one bad thing about being 0 hours from home. when I remember something that I forgot to bring, or didn't think I would need, there's not much I can do about it. ok what else do I need to do today. its labor day. I like not having class. umm ok think, I need to study chapter 0 in biology. really I need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today. and I need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff. I feel like I always  have something to do. it was this way in high school too though so I guess its not that bad. there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but I can't place it. I don't think I've ever heard this song but I know the band. that's not saying much for the band. or maybe it is. either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike. I don't know which it is in this case. maybe a little of both. ok the time is not going as quickly as I thought it was. do I have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm I've talked to my mom today about everything I think I needed to tell her. I paid my stupid parking ticket. there's 00 bucks wasted on me stupidity. I thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on "reasons not to appeal your ticket" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason. I love this song. barenaked ladies are a good band. I want to see them in concert again. oh concert. I can't wait for the acl festival coming up. and next weekend I'm going to mexico with the phi delts. oh this is going to be a lot of fun. I'm excited for so many things this semester. I just need to make sure I keep my grades up and everything. I'm sure I will. I don't forsee myself slacking off at all. if I want to get into medical school I need to have the best grades possible. but then I don't know if I really want to go to medical school. I need to talk to an advisor about this stuff. hopefully I can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say. I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought. lets see. I feel like its umm something that too many people do. its over done as a major I guess I don't really know what word to use to describe it. woo! one minute remaining. umm so yeah psychology is really interesting. I'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters. in fact I'm kind of looking forward to it. ok well the times up I guess I'll quit now. that was fun. 
__label__label0 WELL, I FINALLY GOT TO MY WRITING FOR PSY. I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TODAY OFF. MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 0:00 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 000.      MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME. THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR. MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW. I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW PROPNAME IS LOCKED IN JAIL. EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T. PROPNAME IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE. THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND PROPNAME IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 000 YEARS AGO. SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC. SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ORGNAME. IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 0 MINUTES. 00 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY. I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY. I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME. I MISS IT. THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE. LIKE ORGNAME, ORGNAME SPORT, ORGNAME ORGNAME AND BLACK MARKET, ORGNAME. I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS. I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 00 IN THE AFTERNOON.       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER. HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO. I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT. I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME. I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY. I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE. I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON. WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY. IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND. 
__label__label1      Oh man I'm so hungry. I can't wait for the football game tonight, it's going to be lots of fun. Wow, I think really fast, cause I'm so thinking about 0 things at once. Hunger, football, and the giant pre-screening survey thing that I just took. Can you believe that I finished it at 0:00, only 0 minutes left before they stopped accepting them. Man talking about some pressure. Speaking of pressure, I just thought of physics, which is kind of weird since I don't have physics this year. I do have math though. I played cards last time I was in class. We played this crazy Russian game. It was really cool. We tied in the end. ^_^ Wow, ok, so now that I typed ^_^, I thought of anime and forums since I use that on forums all the time, and it's an anime face. And now I'm thinking about how I can type without looking at the keyboard. I just moved the mouse, and that reminded me of a real mouse. Man, I make a lot of typos. Of well, did you know that I learned to type too early that I lifted my hands off the keyboard so I could type faster since, I had small hands. And so in I think 00th grade I had to fix myself, and retaught myself 00 finger typing. Cause you see this "hover hands" typing caused me to look at the keyboard. The song just changed and it totaly distracted me. Speaking on PROPNAME, I met a girl named PROPNAME Song, the first Day of Psycology and she's really cool. I like her a lot as a friend but at the same time I want to ask her out. But you know that my biggest fear (and pretty much the only one) is losing a friend. And so I have trouble asking girls out cause I'm afraid after they say no, that they don't want to be friends anymore. Why am I telling you this. Oh well, for all I know you don't read these, or you read them completely. Hehe, you know why do some people type hehe, and other haha. You told us to think about our reactions and our observations. I bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking, pay more attention to their random observation thoughts. I bet that produces a lot of weird data. Me, well I ask a lot of questions, and think really fast. I often find myself daydreaming. ALL THE TIME! hehe. so yeah, wow, hehe sounds like a girl to me. Not to self, refrain from saying hehe. I glanced at the clock for the first time. I wonder is that means that I'm finally bored after 0:00 minutes. But as I keep typing, huh, I thinking more about the actual act of typing. I just looked at the title, "Stream of Consciousness of Writing" but now the music changed to a good song so I'm distracted from that last thought. This song is good. It's techno. I know that I listed to it cause it matches my lifestyle, fastpassed? wow, I can't spell. So yeah, my SAT score was 000 reading and 000 math. That's just a little weighed don't you think ^_^. There it is again. I just though of the entire universe and big guns, and planets and spaceships, this is going by way faster than I can type, but trust me that I'm having a ball here. Soccer, now that I haven't played in a while, and I just started playing tennis. That was tiring, but I want to work to be the best. StarCraft, and my daydream story just came into my mind. You see in order to pass the time I come up with a story and slowly play it out in my head with extreme detail. A single day dream could take up to month to complete, as I start and stop it when neccissary. Man, I'm getting excited about football. You know I've never seen a whole football game before. I'm sweating, maybe I should go turn down the AC, neh, that's my mom's domain, and well I don't want to stop typing. What only 0 minutes left, Well I suppose that means 00% of the time has passed. I wonder why I converted this into a percentage. That's really weird you know. Talk, that's what my phone said, cause it didn't ring, huh, strange, why would I type that. I think that means I'm focussing too much on typing and not enough on other events, although I suppose it really doesn't matter does it. But as I progress I think more and more about my typing. So do you know javascript, did you create that timer, or did you 'steal' the code for it, and use it on you site. I hadn't noticed this song was annoying till now. I normally listen to music when on my computer, you know like browsing the web, or photoshoping (digital image creation). The only times I don't have it on is when I watch anime, or play a game. Speaking of anime, I just finished watching wow ok like 0 titles flashed through my head. Hellsing, that was the last one I watched. You know I like anime much better than TV cause they can create a long drawn out plot which is infinitly better than a single 00 minute plot. It's like watching a book rather than reading one. Reading, the last thing I read was a StarCraft book, yeah it came from the game. That's sad I know, but I just couldn't focus on Lord of the Rings you know. I wonder how much other people type, I mean, am I a fast typer. The amount they turn in has to be due to the typing speed and not the thought speed let me tell you, cause we think incredibly fast. 
__label__label1 Autumn will be here soon. I wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city. Down. Down the elivator once again, floor 00, now floor 0. I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath. That single inhale was a day, was a life. Old postcards line my smile. I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess. Heart or head, it doesn't matter. but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching. My little fan is growling at me. It's probably upset that I always leave it on. Let me turn it off really quick. Ok. Done. I heard a door shut. The people in my dorm are an infestation. I cannot STAND them. I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same. Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look. Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. I LOOK at the people. They make me laugh! We are so strange. I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls. People who try to look sexy. People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. People look at me too. What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. My heart races when they do that. It's kind of a love. I love them for that one milisecond. I understand them for one lapse of time. But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me. That's my job. I absolutely hate being in here. Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books. entertainment is all I need on media terms. We should kill our TV's though. As one of my favorite bands says "I wish the world was flat like the old days". I have to say: Amen. We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking. 
__label__label0      Why don't the washing machines ever work in my dorm? I mean I swipe and swipe my student I'd and nothing. Nothing ever starts up. I don't carry change on me just because I know Ill spend it on dumb stuff, so I guess Ill never get my clothes washed. Which is a really strange thing because back home I am so meticulous about being clean and having a something new to wear everyday. I don't really care as much here. I only care when I go out what I have on. This is for the pure reason of wanting to impress males. There is so many cute guys at LOCNAME, going out is soon going to be a problem if I don't get my all my work done. I am so scared of not doing well in my classes. This is the big times. If I screw up here there may be no point of return. Its either do it or get out. There's like 00000 people here who are pre-med and I'm guessing 0000 of them are smarter than me, which really doesn't work in my favor when it comes to getting into med school. Ah, why am I putting myself down!? I can do it. I know I can, I've wanted this forever so I'm not going to just give up. I really loathe calculus though. I work so hard,and then I always seem to screw up the exams. Why? I don't know, maybe I have testing anxiety? Is that really a real thing or is just some excuse I'm making up for my bad testing skills. Well, whatever it is I need to get it under control. My roommate seems to have everything under control. She wakes up, makes her bed, goes to class, does 0 work out classes, eats fruits and vegetables for dinner, studies, then goes to sleep at 00 pm. I'm like "WOW" here's the model student, so of course what do I do? I try to model her actions. Yah, its not working so well. I am just not such a structured person. I do believe I have A. D. D though, or maybe once again this is just another excuse. I just cannot focus on my reading assignments for more than like thirty minutes. What's the deal? I have no idea. Oh I have so much to do tomorrow, so many things to take care of . I need to find out when my old professors office hours are this fall. I really don't want to have to see him again, but its got to be done. Especially if I want my grade fixed. I hated my grades this summer. I can't believe I let myself slip that low. Well its really taught me a lesson. I think. I mean I am actually getting more studying done, or activities persay, such as this writing assignment. But I still feel like the same old me. Gosh, there this amazing jacket I want at the mall. I wish I just had an endless supply in my checking account. But don't we all? Yah good thing I got a new job here. My job is so badass. Wait am I allowed to say ass in a school assignment. hmmmm interesting. Oh well there's no going back now! But I do get paid a lot of money and that helps me a lot, because I am so expensive. If I walk into a store, the only thing I'm going to like I can guarantee is going to the be the most money. My room is so freezing cold. I really need to find out if something can be done about this. It's 00 degrees all the time, I'm sitting here in like my eskimo clothes in the middle of summer in texas. It's ridiculous. I really miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. They had their own thermostats in each room. It was clean. And big. Speaking of san jac. Football season starts Saturday. WOOHOO. I'm the biggest dork, I get so into school events like that. It just feelsreally cool to be a part of something so big. It is sort of like when I'm walking past the tower and the mail bldg. and I look down and see the capitol building. I'm amazing, like "wow, I really made it here!" It's kind of surreal to me, like an out of body experience. Then there is always the kids who make it look so easy to be here and like they don't give a damn, I'm like stop that! Exclamation marks make it look like I'm overly excited or yelling or something. I don't like that so I won't use them any more. Is this 00 min up yet? okay, I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking that. Great now I've fallen into the trap of thinking about thinking of what to write for this paper. I thought all day long about how to avoid this hole. Yah it wasn't doable. Is doable a word? do able. I don't know but I like using it. uhhhh. That's the sound of me going braindead. Well not necessarily, that would mean I was dead and obviously I'm not because duh here I am typing. I just really can't concentrate with my room being so cold. My nose is like an icicle. You know speaking of stream of consciousness, I have always wanted to read PROPNAME. Isn't that the name of the book by PROPNAME PROPNAME ? Yah I read an excerpt from it and it was very intriguing. They do this whole writing thing a lot better than I do. I'm looking at my writing and I feel that I sound Childish, not intelligent, like I should be dictating more mature words. Oh god there I go trying to sound smarter. I guess all I can do is write what's in my head. This is me, this is it. Only like one more minute to go and thank goodness. I feel like I've been having to force myself to think or something for the last twenty. Plus I've been thinking in like turbo speed. Sometimes I talk like that. Very fast. People can't understand me its horrible. Oh damn my hand hurts so bad. Ok good I am finally. D-o-n-ne. 
__label__label0      So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind. Which is not a good way to start off the school year. I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. First, I am taking ORGNAME 000M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. Then I am taking ECO 000K with an amazing professor. I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study. I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is PROPNAME PROPNAME weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP000K which is a community service class. We have to do community service every week for at least 0 hours. I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. This class should be interesting. I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. This class is just something I need to take. Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  PROPNAME seems very laid back and cool. With the music at the beginning of each class, etc. I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year. Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 0. 000 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party. I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now. I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. So hopefully Ill get my act together soon. Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting. That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha ORGNAME Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her. Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '00 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha. PROPNAME, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha. I always seem to have boy problems. But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess). Anywho, there is this one boy who is a ORGNAME Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is PROPNAME who I kind of talked to last semester. He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks. I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him. And he's 00 (haha). But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone. I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. But then again I don't want to lead him on and then "break" his heart. Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). He is super cute and very interesting. I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him. I think he could teach me a lot about life in general. Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with. So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast. Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. Then there is PROPNAME who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better. So we shall see how things go. I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 00 minutes. I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast. This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade. Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now. This weekend is our first home football game which I am very excited about!  We play LOCNAME LOCNAME and we should whopp some beee-hind!  I can't wait~ 
__label__label0     Stream of Consciousness:  That time counter is very annoying, the videos that switched. a really good song just came on, I think it is by PROPNAME PROPNAME. This office smells kind of funny sometimes. I met this Girl named PROPNAME today and she is a runner for UT. I hope Parking and Transportstion appeals my ticket. I have some really random thoughts.  I want the best things out of life. But I fear that I want too much!  What if I fall flat on my face and don't amount to anything. But I feel like I was born to do BIG things on this earth. But who knows.  There is this Persian party today. My neck hurts. But I am excited about attending this party. The girl I like will be there. She is my ex. Btu it's all good. I hope she still has feeling for me. I woke up this morning with a terrible head ache.  I am wondering if I should invite my brother and hos friends to that party. I really wasn't invited myself, but I know PROPNAME will be there. I have some messages on my phone. How do you track feelings?  That must be hard to do. I feel good!  Healthy, kind of tired - but its morning time. I should call PROPNAME. I miss her. She is very cool. I hope no one actually wastes their time reading this. Because this stream of consciouness in BS. But it's ok. I guess I will learn something new from this class. I made a taks sheet for today. But I dought (is that how you spell that word?) I will finish everything on there. But I might. Life is much simpler when you have direction.  I need to get stated on my well logging  homework. I bet you guys don't even read this paper. I would be interested in seeing how people stucture this writing assignment. I mean, the way people form their paragraphs and stuff. As you can see I like writing paragraphs 0-0 sentences at a  time. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, time is almost up. I am very glda to be done with is assignment. Thanks    
__label__label0 What do I write about? That is a good question, but I guess I should write about writing, or think about thinking. The thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued I am at the moment. I have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and I just want to sit and do nothing. I guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. Part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. PROPNAME PROPNAME is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. I wish I were sleeping and I wish I did not have to report to the house in about 00 minutes because I just want to do nothing right now. I don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. I did not have much class today, so I got to sleep in, but I could still use some rest. Perhaps I need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. I just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. I have been in school here for about two weeks, and I think it is really quite a cool set up. You don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. Sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in Psychology, only my other classes. The biggest adjustment I think from High school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. One of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. That guy is such a mess and I was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. Let's see here, it has been 00 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. It is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. I am trying to search for thoughts, but I just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. All of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and "margaritaville. "  I wish I were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. We have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around LOCNAME. But now my hands are kind of aching because I don't think I have ever typed this long without taking a break. I am certain that I wil have great stamina in my hands when I am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. It is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days  because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. I like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. I look up at the clock and see I am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 00 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say. I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. Looks like I am  out of time.        
__label__label1      Ok, writing. I started this a few minutes ago but apparently in Mozilla Firefox the timer doesn't work. Sorry if I end up submitting two essays. Right now I'm kind of hungry. My stomach is growling, I haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning. I didn't use to eat breakfast, but now I do. One minute down. I feel pressured, like I have to continue hitting keys or I'm not doing as well as I should on this writing assignment. Which is strange because all I have to do is write something, anything, and I get credit for it. Is it cheating if I use the backspace key to edit my mistakes?  There are quite a few of them. I probably would type better and therefore faster if I slowed down, which is paradoxical but true. I am also sleepy. Maybe I will take a nap, except I have to study. Hooray. That's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do. I'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday. The description of the rat kind of makes me wish I was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped. Seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant. Maybe in this case it does. I wonder what it's like. Maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical). Maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure. Quite a way to go. I am running out of things to write about and it's only been 0:00 minutes. My mind is becoming a blank. Perhaps I can shove something in there. Nope. Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub. I'm regressing back to childhood, oh no!  Forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what I would have expected. If you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive. I wonder why I keep bringing up images and thoughts from when I was young?  Perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what I learned yesterday or what I see on ORGNAME. ORGNAME. I do not like that channel at all. I do not like it in a boat, I do not like it with a goat. I do not like it, PROPNAME I Am, I do not like ORGNAME ORGNAME. The channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against. At least they encourage people to vote. That's a positive message coming from a negative source. I guess no one or nothing is truly evil. Well, nine minutes gone. I'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as PROPNAME put it. Like everything in my mind has already come out and I'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw. Of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and I suppose it's the same with the mind. One thing I never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness. In the textbook it seems like a step is skipped. An analogy can be made (and has been, I assume) between the mind and the computer. One could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text. But the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data. Where are the programs in the mind?  It's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement. Where is the software?  I'm just rambling now. Although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it?  Ha ha. I tried to read the book House of Leaves, I was told it was brilliant, but you know what?  It, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks. It's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it. Speaking of which, Hello, whoever is reading this!  I hope you're having a wonderful day. Although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day. Still, someone's got to do it, right?  Someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it. Then the worker loses their job. Which is better, I wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all?  Some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us. We will become like PROPNAME's Solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population. Eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human. Or maybe not. What will be the point of civilization then?  What is the point of it now?  To keep people happy?  Great job so far, I must say. Nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals. More and more chemicals, pills, etc. to cure the imbalances in their head. They should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware!  Biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far. People who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them?  Eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed. Quite a while to be writing. You know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short. I love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it. If only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention. It all deals with people's perception anyway -- I bet there is a way, somewhere. Although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea. Speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up. It's been a pleasure. 
__label__label0 I am sitting in my room and I look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. Trying to make my train of thought come to me so I can type it. All I can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues. He believes in "Boxism", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. Then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. After this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. After we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. Then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. My boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as I remember when he first told me this. Wow, that only took me ten minutes. I look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, I believe that those are some of the best times in my life. My class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. I have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. I hope it becomes the best time of my life. I have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. I love being able to do whatever I want when I want to. I hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.  
__label__label1      I just opened iTunes and chose to play PROPNAME PROPNAME's album called "A Tribute to Jack PROPNAMEson". The first song "Right Off" begins with a strong groove. this music first puts me into a pretty good mood. It motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise. Now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up. PROPNAME PROPNAME is on guitar I believe, if not I'm pretty sure it's John PROPNAME. Now PROPNAME is playing. gosh. he's quite an impressive player. He's not showing off by playing a note every second. He takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody.   . and they're always good too. I'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime, to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing, because of a difference in style from the popular, well-advertised music of the 00's and 00's. or otherwise some people aren't even given the chance to be exposed to it. My roommate just came in the room. Speak of the devil, eh?  Take him for example. When I first met him and asked what he listened to, the first two things he said were "ORGNAME and LOCNAME LOCNAME". both of which I am not biased against or hold negative regard towards. Actually I find both bands to be quite interesting. I was exposed to PROPNAME and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school, and definately listened to it quite extensively. Side note:  it's getting hot and I'm turning on the fan. Could this music and the pressure to write as fast as I can be causing my body to heat up?  That could be quite interesting. Going back. I find it weird, well not weird but sad basically, that people like my roommate haven't heard and don't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes. "new" meaning "previously unknown" as opposed to recently released. The song just phased into an ambient sound while PROPNAME is playing over it. The drums, bass, and guitar have dropped out. When the jam comes back in. and here it comes. oh yes. Well done. Movement (change) in music I have realized (as a good explanation) is what creates uniqueness and good sound. Change can include any part of sound. pitch, tempo, tambre, etc. Now it's just the Bass and PROPNAME. On this album is PROPNAME PROPNAME on drums, PROPNAME PROPNAME is on keyboards. I'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head. My roommate is playing video games behind me. I understand his addiction. I used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school. I went to an Arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics. obviously I did well enough to get into ORGNAME, but sadly not well enough for my own standards, although I did not realize it at the time. I quit playing games during my senior year in high school, picked up some other bad habits, but since moving to LOCNAME for school things have changed nicely, and although I'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet, I guess I feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future. although the future is quite unexpected, otherwise I don't really know what I'm going to do. The song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it. . and time's up. 
__label__label1 I am so ready to go home and see my family and friends. I have never really ever been by myself for this long. It would not be so bad if I had at least one familiar face around but I really don't. I am trying to get to know my roommates better but I guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years. In my small town we will be friends forever but here I am not so sure. I really hope I can get involved with the church here. I think that will help a whole lot. I want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole "lets get drunk at every social event" really bugs me. Why can't people just have good clean fun? I love the team and the school but I can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! Anyway I am looking forward to seeing the familiar. I love it here and am gload I came but I am looking forward to next weekend. I am really ready to see aron and my other friends. This has been the longest we have been separated. I pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever. I love him so much. We can talk about anything. It is great. We share so many things in common. He loves God and that means the most to me. It is a real balanced relationship. Wow I cannot believe it has only been 0 minutes. It feels like an eternity. I have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes. I am kind of nervous aout my classes. My major is Spanish and I am not so good at it yet. Hopefully it will come with more practice. Wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great. I cannot wait. I am so ready to be around people and meet people. I want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances. It is kind of lonely with just saying "hi how are you?" and then nothing past that. O well. I hope I am doing well in school. I don't just want to be here, I want to thrive here. I want to be the best that I can be with everything I do. I want to be proud of myself and I want others to be proud. I like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests. But then again, if I mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up. I am shooting for A's but one or two B's would not be awful. But I am studying for A's. I need to start working out. I have been sick though but I need to start again. Maybe someone might like to go with me. It is always better with someone else. I am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. I also wish PROPNAME was here, it would be so much easier. Hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. He is like a brother to me and will always be. I really miss him. Hopefully he will call back but I guess I will just call him again. Well these are all the things  I have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. I think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 00 minutes. I wish all writing assignments were this easy. I need to sign up for more experiments so I don't get behind. I also need to do some passoffs. Hopefully if I study them well today I can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 00 left. That would be good. I wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. I love my little town. I would not trade it for the world. Those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as I do but they will some day. I am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. I like it that I live here cause my dad visits a lot. My family is awesome. They do so much for me and I thank God I have them. You know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. What is this world coming to?  I am so voting for PROPNAME! 
__label__label0      I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't. I wonder where the printers are. its already 0:00. its so quiet in here. I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. I hope I'm spelling okay. I can't wait until tomorrow. "and I love you, and its more then I ever knew. " (I'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. I'm so glad I learned to type. I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer. I hope I understand it. this weekend I go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and I love him more everyday. I hope this feeling lasts. I would love to marry him, in like 0 years. he's great and we're great together, I miss him. I just saw him yesterday but I miss him. I'm hungry. I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. I wonder what I'm going to eat today. I had a sandwhich yesterday. I should eat something hot. hmm. I guess I could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 0:00. I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. I wonder when the swelling will go down. I should email my dad. I hope my string doesn't come off. I forgot to put my rings back on. I hope I don't lose them. tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. I should eat. what did I eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. I should eat dinner after this. I have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. I hope I'm doing this right. hmm. I think so. I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. 
__label__label1      Stream of consiousnesssskdj. How do you spell that? Fuck if I know. I don't seem to know much today. why the fuck am I so off. I'm just writing this shit cause it sounds pitiful. Or will hell the writing sounds like I'm writing for someone else to read. No one is going to read this, nor does what I write matter. So confess away. Make it worthwhile. What is this fucking heat I feel all the time, what the hell, I've heard the scientific explanations but they don't feel right. Hot cold I don't know. It prickles mwhen I should. I got a damn ticket today. my first one damnit. I was doing so good but I knew it was coming it was inevitable I f I brag about what I have why shoul di have what I get its not the fucking point to tel everyone else that I have it better than them. humanity is fuckecd can we save it which I knew I don't know anything all scienctific fac tis bullshit maybe some theory might hold over but that would be total luck. string wtf. microfribers connecting us all. PROPNAME that's ridiculous how do I float about life s  easily just things come when I need them to. really really badly and make an effort and it sthere. its that way for some certainly not job ha ha that's the fuckin shit dud ei m so funny. I really like my new sense of the humore isnce the rool. the roll. jese what the hell was that I would like know. Dead space. And I type what a prick. the constant battle. Why is there a batlle are normal people at peace I don't think so otherwise well religion . I wonder what time it is I'm going toclose fuckk shit I'm I sweare I'm wahts it called the shit I know fuck ah ah damn I forgot to much pot is that problem is it the drugs. I really need to stop smoking cigarettes why is it harder now that she will be here sooner shouldn't I be overwhelmed with joy, iam but also shit is just annoying and I don't know what to do about that, I wish I had some sort of sign but I already had my gift and know what I need to do how can I reationally use  a drug experience to justify mylife, but it just feels right you knwo the path, now don't fuck it, is that hard why am I lead so far astray things are fyckeed up she feels off and away from me I want this to finish so I can meditate since I'm almsot there how do I fall into trances so easily I feel the warmth over my body enveloping me. holding me tight in its arms guiding me a warmer shorre, I hate comign back I'm going to be out if I do that, its ok, I can talk to my baby while I'm eout shell understand my fingers are getting tired I can  type really relay fast if I want to ha anyone readying this hasd no idea how fast I'm typing, they could estimate but thye wouldn't know for sure so ha. Reviewing what I have writtin was odd, it was like reading a trippers rants while high. My warmth. Wow, I sound so out there. I do feel that this is the way though, my path was a gift and I should appreciate it. Most people don't get to have visions of their daughter, I don't rember the face anymore, I'm so lost. This is so hard to do. I hate it. Why can't we just have our time. Alone. Away. Just the two of us and then the little one. I can't remeber her face but I can remeber that emotion. what a physical change when I think of her. I can feel the warmth surrounding my body. The love taking everything over. but then the back gives out and I kill my chakras. Transliteration sucks. 00 min of writing my thoughts is intense. the difference in punctuation is shocking, in the begging I used a lot of epsilons(mas o menos) and was excited, then I peak and nothing but chops of sentances, no punctiuations, calm down, have commas, and then periods. awesome, I lost my network connection. I wonder if that ruins this. 
__label__label0 So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it fPROPNAME over like 0 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 0 minutes. However, I've noticed that PROPNAME's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 0 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see PROPNAME again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to ORGNAME in the spring. Or actually, I hope PROPNAME can come to LOCNAME for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the PROPNAME family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like PROPNAME. And even PROPNAME and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for PROPNAME and the whole family. God, PROPNAME and PROPNAME really do care about me and PROPNAME like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about PROPNAME cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like "do you want a drink?" Wow, I was like thinking "what is this?" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole "Louvre" idea. I always say I hate LOCNAME and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to LOCNAME in the summer. But I mean if PROPNAME wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, PROPNAME has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to PROPNAME. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to PROPNAME or PROPNAME talking to them. No, but PROPNAME's really cool. But so is PROPNAME's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and PROPNAME need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. PROPNAME is one of PROPNAME's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe 
__label__label1 my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy. I came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me. I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was. I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one. don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy/simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 00 years of there life online and I believe it. there is just so much to do online. I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that. I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so I totally love LOCNAME LOCNAME, she is such a riot. I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. I want to read it, I think it will be amusing. on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them. I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth. I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. I never realized 00 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. I hate that. how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity. I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it. however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. I have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. I hate how little kids are so fat today. I wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat ANYTHING. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 0 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 0 cokes a day. crazy crazy. I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. I can't imagine it not being computer timed. I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere I guess. I'm so hungry its not funny. I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored. I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. I'm quitting this at 0 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 0 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 0 min before 0 and that should be even. I feel like I started this at 0:00 hmmmmmm I can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. I don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life. I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time. I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom. ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 0 minutes and counting. 0:00 will be the new time for completion. 0 more minutes. and I'm stumped. I don't know what to type/talk about. ooooooo 0 minutes and counting. ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . Times up. 
__label__label1 I don't know why, but for some reason I am extremely nervous about this writing  assignment. It most likely won't even be read! Random, but I started thinking  about what an awful driver I am in LOCNAME. All of the one way streets and stop  signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. I've already ran two red  lights. whoops. Since this writing assignment is online, I can't help but read the  instant messages that pop up while I'm typing. I love talking to people online, I  think I'm addicted. It really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family  now that we are all living in different cities. Especially since two of my best friends  are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, I can talk  to them all at the same time. It is very convenient. Since coming to college I have  become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. Tomorrow night the Sig  Eps are having an 00's theme party, so last night I spent about an hour  downloading hit songs from the 00's. My friends and I are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. It will be awesome. Today my friend PROPNAME and I  went shopping at thrift stores to find 00's garb. I found the best 00's pumps for only  six dollars. Can you say jackpot?  I think my favorite 00's song right now has to be  PROPNAME's Girl by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wish I was Jessie's girl, because then I would  date his best friend. Speaking of dating, I think dating in college is going to be  rather difficult considering there are approximately 00 gorgeous girls on campus  to every one attractive guy. Not that looks are everything, but that is what  generally draws two people together to start talking. Actually I think that is usually  the case, but I am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the  attractive hard asses. Racquetball is my new favorite sport. I have played five times since I've been  here. It's really the best work out. It's so much better than running for 00 minutes. just play racquetball for 00 minutes and you can't breath. It's such a great feeling. I have had a few complaints though, because I tend to accidentally hit the person I  am playing with a little too often than necessary. I've hit my sister like twice and I  couldn't even guess how many times I've hit PROPNAME. Whoops! I love going to concerts. They are probably on my top 0 favorite things to do list,  along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. I wish we had some  snow nearby, but I would hate to live in the cold so I guess I don't really want snow  close by. I almost went to school in LOCNAME, LOCNAME but I realized I would have  to wear about 0 layers of clothing just to walk to class and I decided it just wasn't  worth it. I am a Texan, if I didn't break a sweat between classes I don't know what I  would do with myself. I can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new  college friends. I have been looking forward to that for a
