__label__label1 I have watching Comedy Central for the past hour or so. The program involved people getting paid not to laugh while listening to comedians. If I were one of those people paid not to laugh, I wouldn't pay attention to the actual words the comedians was saying. Listening to the skit would most likely make me laugh, so I would think of something else. I would discuss with myself something really boring, so as not to laugh. Speaking of boring, I received two letters today from my boyfriend. He was talking about being bored in class. He attends ORGNAME, the idiot. My parents don't know he's my boyfriend. They think he's just my best friend since that's what we were all last year. My sister, whose computer I'm using, doesn't know either. I hope she doesn't read anything I'm writing here. If she did, I'm not so sure she wouldn't tell my parents. My mother loves my boyfriend, but I don't think she or my father would let me visit him at ORGNAME if they knew he was more than just my friend. Otherwise, I would love to tell them. They would be so happy for both of us, seeing as how they love him. I just want to be able to have him visit me and me visit him without my parents wondering why we're visiting each other. Plus, my parents are quite protective. I don't know how their attitudes towards him would change if they knew. All of my past boyfriends have been introduced to them only after we became boyfriend and girlfriend. My past boyfriends were very different from my current boyfriend. Their outlook on life, intelligence level, looks, interests, and families were exact opposites from his. He's exceptionally smart, and I'm not just saying that because he's my boyfriend. He loves PROPNAME, his theories, and computers. My old boyfriends loved roller blading, and non-intelligent ways of spending an evening, if you know what I mean. My boyfriend actually listens when I talk to him. He will also talk if I ask him a question. He doesn't lie to me, which is a big change. In fact, we spend most of our time together just talking about differing interesting things. You would think we would run out of things to say, but there is always more. We've had these talks for at least nine months and still have more to talk about. I can actually see spending the rest of my life with him. I can't believe I just said that. I never thought I'd be able to say that about anyone. Wow, I'm impressed. He's one of the closest things to my heart. It's weird actually talking about this. For the longest time, I didn't want anyone that close. Now it's kind of comforting. Oh boy, I have been typing for quite a while now. Sorry. Bye, and have fun reading this and delving into my soul. 
__label__label1 I suppose we all get caught up in a web our first year. I wonder sometimes if it is going to be too much for me to handle. I guess everyone feels the way I do. People sure make me feel that they are smarter than me though. I should do well. Why not, I have just as much potential as the next person. This person sitting  next to me now is making me tense. I wonder why. Come on PROPNAME, your a Drama  major, your not suppose to feel nervous. I feel better now that she left though. Man some of these people really type fast. I don't even hear any pauses. Great, another victim sitting next to me. I suppose we are all victims though. I wonder what everyone else wrote on this paper. It feels a little odd. Seems kind of like my mind just rambles on. I guess everyone's does though. I really need to speed up my typing. I used to be so quick. I really have a lot of stuff to do today. Man I miss my best friends. I miss PROPNAME even though I hate to admit it. It seems like I tell her that more than I tell anyone else. Maybe she is the same way. I know she probably is making up some reason why I don't love her anymore. She is just whiny like that. I wish she wasn't so negative. I'm always going to love her. Too bad she is in LOCNAME. Ok, somebody turn on the air in here. It is  getting a little warm. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME are up to. I know PROPNAME is mad at me but I only wish she knew the way LOCNAME really is. I mean, it is not like I'm the only one telling her to watch out. Ten minutes to go, or is it five? Oh well, I'll just keep pecking at the keys. I really don't want to go to class today. I don't know how people can skip though. That is all I need is to get  behind on all my work. I still have another one of these things to write tomorrow. My classes are cool though. I shouldn't panic too much. Come on, I'm only taking 00 hours. But then, I am just a fish. I'm sure most people feel the same way. I know PROPNAME does. I wonder if he ever goes out and does anything. I'm really surprised that he came to PROPNAME's party with us. Ahhh, he had a good time. This  city is definitely not LOCNAME. I hate to admit it, but, I think I like it better  there. I wonder who I will end up together with. I'm lonely but yet I don't think that I want anything serious. Oh what do I know?  00:00, I think I have 0 more  minutes. Whoever is reading this probably thinks I'm nuts. I wonder if someone really is going to read all of this since there is so many students. Wow, the typing is getting better. It is funny what a little practice will do. I wonder if they have a word processor down here. Why does everything have to be online. It might not be so bad if I could get mine to work. I wonder what I am going to do. Oh  well. Yea, finally through. 
__label__label0 Ok. Here we go. Well I really don't have much to say right now. I've done this type of writing before. It was a strange experience. All I ended up writing was the lyrics to some song I couldn't get out of my head. I just kept going over and over again. Don't you hate that?  I especially hate it when it's like some obnoxious song that I only know the chorus to or something. Hmmm. Right now I’m wondering how in the world I’m supposed to keep on typing for twenty minutes and keep on coming up with things to say. It's kind of like when you meet someone new and you're trying to have a conversation with them and you keep hitting those brick walls. I constantly do that. You can only ask a person their major so many times. I wish I would have taken a typing class in high school. Everyone else I know did but I procrastinated so I could only take a programming class for my computer credit. But it was good that I took that class. Now I’ve learned that I really do hate programming. I have to come to terms with the fact that I like computers yet I hate programming. I think my brain would slowly build up pressure and then explode when I’m in my 00s if I became a programmer. My typing skills are atrocious!  I think I’ve been out of practice. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing?  She's my roommate and she's sitting next to me. She always gets a lot of e-mail, yet she complains regularly that no one writes her. I like get nothing but that could be because I don't write anyone either. Oh well. I think if I got into the e-mail habit again, I would waste way too much time in the computer lab anyway. Oh no. Mind block. This is kind of like writing a letter to your closest friend. (which I also haven't done in a while. )  Just say whatever an who cares if they care or not. What are you guys going to do with this information anyway??  I missed the first day of class so I really don't know how this stuff is going to be used. I've always been afraid that if I ever went to a psychologist or something, that they would end up telling me that I’m nuts or something. Or they would know something about me that I really don't want them to know. And there's a lot of that kind of stuff. Everyone in this room is staring blankly into the screen of their computers. Isn't it amazing the power these little boxes of silicon and metal have over us?  Imagine our world today without computers. (apparently I actually learned something from my comp sci class here)  If one day all computers just stopped working, we would all be screwed. The world would go haywire. I would go nuts. And don't limit it to the computer in the traditional sense. We're talking the little computer chip in your remote control or in your light fixtures. Everything. Hey. that would make a good story. I bet it's been done before but I think I just inspired myself. That'll be my second movie. Did I say I wanted to be a director?  Well I do. Now I have three ideas for my first films. I really can't wait. I need to go out and buy some books. I've been running out of things to read. I love books. Actually I have a new favorite author. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That reminds me I need to look him up on the web. I wonder if he's written anything else??  I hope so. "Vurt"  was one of the best books I’ve ever read. Well, times up. :) 
__label__label1 I'm at home right now. it's weird because I don't really live here anymore  sine my new home is at LOCNAME. 'm glad I got to come and see my dog and my cats. they miss me alot. I love my sister. she already says she wants to be a d-g  and she knows nothing about it but that her big sis is one. I have so much  to do that it's crazy. I feel like no mater what I do there's always something  else to do. I am sooooooo excited about Friday. my ex-boyfriend is diving down  from tech to see me. it's been over a month since I’ve seen him. I can't  decide what to do about him. we get along great. he can treat me well, when  he doesn't he doesn't do it on purpose. I know that this sounds pathetic but  it's not. I’m confused because I want us to get back together this weekend but I also want to just be friends. it's just that I love him so much and could see myself married to him. I know that he loves me. he said that he wanted us to get back together, but we'll see what happens. it's amazing how the boy is  always on my mind. I mean, the more I try to stop, the worse it gets. I guess that's how you know that you're in love. ok, it's been ten minutes and I still  have ten to go. yeah, not. I hate to write. I hate that I had to take freshman English because I got at 000 instead of a 000 on my sat0. dumb. the class will be  easy though. I like college life. the only class I’m scared of is calculus. I was supposed to take it in high school but was busy with dance and pals so I didn't take it. big mistake. I’ve forgotten so much stuff since junior year. my lil sis is a big sophomore now. she still seems so young to me. my parents went to the airport to get my older bro. he's the perfect son-national merit scholar, works for my dad, etc. the cowboys won today. I was exited. PROPNAME, my ex, and I used to bet on the cowboy games. this reminds me to copy that e-mail he wrote. he was fighting with this other guy over me. how romantic. I miss him alot. I’m so glad I get to see him this weekend. I know that this is materialistic, but I’m worried about what to wear. I have this effect on him that he can't resist me(I know it sounds like I have an ego, but he has the same effect on me which makes it so hard) it was easy when I’d see him every day because it made him want to be with me. but I’m worried now that he's  away, he'll forget about his woman in LOCNAME. but whatever's mean to be will be. I’m very religious, but today I didn't go to church. it's hard to find time in college. excuses, excuses. I need to go by and oil-absorbing mask. my oily skin is gross. well, I’d love to sit here and type some more, but my time is about up and I have to go to the store before my parents and brother get home for family hamburgers night. I can't decide if I’m going home to UT tonight or not. I think I might just stay here but I can't decide. hope that my  mind helps you in this experiment or whatever this is. I can't to learn about all this mind stuff. it looks coll. well, bye for now. ps- I feel like I  just wrote a long e-mail to a friend. maybe that's what I’ll do now. 
__label__label0 I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if I’m just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because LOCNAME is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate LOCNAME. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 0 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 00 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell can’t I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think I’ll just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. 
__label__label1 As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 0 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they are mostly going to ORGNAME but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend PROPNAME the most and my best friend PROPNAME the 0nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really I’m not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 00 years old and he is in 0th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 00 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope I’m not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 0 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. 
__label__label1 I am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, I have mono. Soon I will find out whether or not I have strep throat. In fact , I need to call the medical center hotline later, although I guess it really doesn't matter that much because I am already taking penicillin. Last night I could not sleep at all I was in so much pain. I would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. But, then about an hour later I would wake up and wish I was dead, not literally, but I just wish the pain would go away. I can deal with feeling sick all the time because I know that will eventually go away. I have so much stuff I need to do still, but I never have the energy to do it. I miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, I guess that is part of growing up. LOCNAME plays Rudgers this weekend here and I already have my tickets, I wonder what that whole day will be like. I also miss all of my friends from high school, but I got two letters 0 days ago. I always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. Even when I was a little kid I would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. I was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and I argued all the time. But, now I seem to really miss them, I think because I am sick I miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when I was sick. I wonder how my brothers are doing, I haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. Everything here at LOCNAME is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. The people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. I hope I can actually make good grades in my Calculus class, which is really hard. I guess  I need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. Computers are really interesting. They seem like part of the "system" and red tape involved in everything. Not that I don't appreciate or like technology, It just isn’t personal at all. I need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why I think I miss my family, they were always there to talk to. I know I can graduate from college, but I sometimes wonder whether or not I really can. I also wonder about the many paths my life could take. Will I be truly happy in the future? Will somebody love me enough to marry me?  Will I ever find a person I want to marry. What job will I have, how much money will I make. Will I be as successful as my Dad?  Can I live up to all of the expectations of my family?  Sometimes I see answers to these questions, I don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination?  I feel like time is passing and I am not really making an impact. 
__label__label0 I don't really understand. I am supposed to track my thoughts and feelings?  Write about anything as long as it is for twenty minutes?  OK. I kind of miss my old life at home, but I was so looking forward to moving on to other things. I have a friend that just went into the ORGNAME last month and I will never see him again. Other friends have gone off to college and moved away. Life is starting to change a great deal. I work for a company called ORGNAME selling ORGNAME, or at least I did this summer, and we had conventions every now and then. I would always make friends from around the country, but end up never seeing them again. People don't keep in touch with each other like they should. I try to stay in touch with my friends and people that I meet. It is often difficult, though. I don't know. I am really thirsty right now. I was thinking of going up to my room first to get a drink, but I didn't figure they would let you bring drinks in here, and I didn't want to wait to get this done. I have waited long enough. I need to stop putting things off. I need to get things done. I guess it is just lack of motivation. Well that and lack of a computer. This is the first time I have been in the computer lab here at Jester. I am really thirsty and my throat is dry. I need to get this e-mail thing worked out. I haven't tried to use it yet. I might do that when I am finished with this. I wish that things could be the way they were, but then I don't. You know how sometimes something happens and you just want to freeze that moment in time and never leave. That has happened to me recently. Not since I have been at LOCNAME, but before, when I was with my friends. I like to spend time with my friends because they make me feel comfortable. I like to be around them because it is just very uplifting. My arm is starting to get tired because I don't have the right kind of writing area. It is uncomfortable in here. I need to go get a drink, but I still have a lot of time to keep writing, so I won't. I wish I had a computer so I could get things done on my own time. Life would be a whole lot easier, I think. I think I should go home and see my dog before the neighbors try to steal him again. If I don't pay enough attention to him he goes to stay at the neighbors house. They decided one day that they liked him and they were just going to keep him. They tried to give me an ultimatum (I don't know how to spell that word). They said that if I didn't give them the dog, then they did not want him at their house anymore, but if I didn't want the dog they would take him. The whole situation didn't make any sense to me, but what do I know. I don't think that they had the right to ask for my dog. He is MY dog. Whatever. Needless to say, I didn't give them the dog, but I got him fixed and had to tie him up for a while. He eventually learned that he had to stay at home, or at least near our house if he didn't want to be tied up. It rained yesterday for the first time in a long while. It didn't rain much, though. I missed most of the lightning the other night because I don't have a real window in my room. It is just like a quarter of a window and it gives me the feeling that I am in a dungeon. I hate my room. I wanted to get a plant, but then I realized that there wouldn't be enough light to keep it alive, so I axed that idea. I wish there would be a big storm because I like to watch the storms. The lightning, thunder, rain, and winds are really relaxing. My parents are building a house, but it is taking them forever. Anyway, you can sit on the back porch of the house and watch the rain. It is very nice. My friends PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME are at LOCNAME and I was just thinking about PROPNAME's yard and how nice it is. I bet it is really nice out there after it rains. The other night I watched a meteor shower and that was really beautiful. I like to look at the stars, but I dropped Astronomy because everyone said that it was really hard and that all it was a lot of math like distances to stars. I didn't feel like taking a math class so now I am taking Physical Anthropology. I don't know. My twenty minutes is up now so I am going to quit writing and submit this because I am sure it is really boring anyway. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this. My wrist hurts. Ha. 
__label__label1 It is 00:00 on Tuesday and my roommate and I just finished eating lunch and  came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. My computer in our  room is not hooked up to the Internet yet, so for the time being I have to come  down here. That's ok. The guy just came over because we forgot to give him our  IDs. Oops. Oh well. Anyway, I'm really sad lately. I miss all my friends from high school. Everyone I've met so far has been really nice and everything; I just miss how close we all were last year. I could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that I knew and would feel comfortable with. Here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many  people that I don't know. Every face that I pass on campus is another stranger. Actually, I have seen a few people that I know from other places. Earlier today I saw PROPNAME. But it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. I was so comfortable there. I don't know. I should  probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since I'm going off about  high school and college and what have you, but I'm kind of just blabbering so  whatever. I am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. I miss my comfort zone that I had at PROPNAME and I want it back!!   Hey!  I just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. I guess I  can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. It's probably been more like seven minutes. I don't like this keyboard. It's kind of hard to type on. This assignment is actually harder than I thought it  would be. I mean, it's not hard, because I'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. I think it's crazy that so many PROPNAME people are in my psychology class. It  also freaks me out that PROPNAME is in our class. Since you don't know about PROPNAME, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. I think  underneath that tough guy Russian thing he has going for him he's really  probably a very nice person, but I don't know how easy it is for me to look past  the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at LOCNAME LOCNAME. So I wouldn't fail PROPNAME if I were you. He might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it "axe" or "ax"?  I don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. I would really like to get to know him though - I think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. Not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. I think that time is probably almost up, but I would kind of like to keep  writing. I think I will. The temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. I don't know where that thought came from. I am scared about having to write papers. What if my professors don't like the way I write?  I've always loved to write, but I like writing creatively. I'm pretty bad at comparing and  contrasting and all my research papers are boring. I mean I got good grades on  them, but later I'd go back and read them and be like "Hey did I actually write this?  Yuck. "  I think I'm probably being hard on myself. I wonder how many  times I have used the word probably in this assignment so far. I bet a lot. I hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. I wonder what PROPNAME's deal is. She used to be so nice, but ever since PROPNAME and  I rushed she has been so rude. That's her problem, I know. And it kind of  always justifies the fact that I didn't like her that much. I always had to  act like I did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has  always rubbed me the wrong way. That's what I told PROPNAME. PROPNAME -- what to do about PROPNAME?  I wish I knew I wish I could have some answer. I hate  leading  him on the way I did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. I know he needs me  and that's what I love about him. When I'm around him I feel  special and needed and important. But I just don't know if that is enough. 
__label__label0 I finally got all of my Ethernet problems worked out today, so I e-mailed  everyone I know. I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 00 disk but I also received my PROPNAME  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm glad  I got a card from PROPNAME today, looks like she's having a good time at ORGNAME. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in LOCNAME, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in LOCNAME and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the ORGNAME game November, PROPNAME doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise I’d write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see PROPNAME then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that I’m getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap. I wish I had some nail polish remover, I need to repaint my toenails. I wonder if I can make it through three weeks before I need to get my nails redone. I hope so I don’t want to change manicurists, I like PROPNAME. 
__label__label1 Ok, I'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. ORGNAME is on in the background, and I'm remembering when I went to see them in concert at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME ,IL. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I came from IL all the way to LOCNAME. I don't feel crazy though. I wanted a change and I really love it down here. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing right now. She isn't answering my e-mail. Ok, it's only been a day , I'm just being impatient. Anyway, I wonder why she doesn't go by PROPNAME. I like it a whole lot better than PROPNAME. And I seriously wonder if she's straight or not. I just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. I hate PROPNAME. They're such one hit wonders. And the one hit is called MMMMMBop. How incredibly stupid is that? They're like a younger , related New Kids. Speaking of New Kids, how about Spice Girls? There's another total lack of talent engineered for success. It's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. What's a great idea? That commercial just said something was a great idea. I know what a great idea would be: if I would start to do my Calculus homework. Sometimes I wonder if I actually want to pass that class. I wonder what I could do to welcome PROPNAME-my roommate-back home after this weekend. God, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. I guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand that level of dependence. Then again I moved from LOCNAME, IL to LOCNAME, LOCNAME with exactly eight minutes of crying. I wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so funny. I love this commercial. Whoever had the idea of having PROPNAME PROPNAME in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. God, I hope Jewel doesn't come on . That one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. I do miss them , but I don't really miss my parents all that much . PROPNAME is always telling me how cold that is , but I can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how I feel. Ok, Jewel did come on, but at least it was just YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME, OOPS I just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. I'm so dumb with computers, I swear. I know so much less about them than all the people around me. I'm confident I'll learn, but I just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. Daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her Plan 0 group. She's really screwy. She doesn't even know if her computer is a PC or a Mac. I guess I'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am I supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. Oh well. PROPNAME's on now. I saw him in concert too. Oh, that just made me a little sad. We all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang FRESHMEN together, and , I don't know. I feel like I'm babbling, but I guess that's pretty much the whole point. I remember Dr. PROPNAME telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. Well, I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. I 'm not really saying much of anything. I don't even feel like I'm saying anything important. I wonder if I should have put on that survey thing that I was bisexual. Not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because I could upset the demographics of their study. Oh well, I'll let them deal with that. Time's up. I hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this. 
__label__label0 I really don't like doing homework. How many hours of my life have been                                                                                                   spent doing homework? I'm sure the  number is unreal. Of course the only time I actually think about mundane things like how many hours I've spent doing homework  is when I'm doing something really boring like. well  homework. Its really warm in my room. I guess I'll have to go down and  get another maintenance request form. There's something seriously wrong with  our air-conditioning which is just not a good thing in LOCNAME, LOCNAME  in the summer. The last time the maintenance man came, he turned the vents down toward the floor. This was his ingenious plan. Great. Needless to  say, that didn't work. So back down to the dorm office I go. Joy of my life. I really wish I was in the mountains. We missed our hiking trip  this summer because we were to busy  showing horses. We went to Canadian  Nationals, but surprise, the horse show was located in the only existing  ugly portion of LOCNAME. Oh well, I'll have to focus on our Christmas  skiing trip and think of the cold snow as I sit in my sweltering room. Well twenty minutes is up. I'm gone.  
__label__label0 What about this school, too many people running from place to place to be of any noticeable . meaning, any noticeable effect. I can't find the word trying to scribe all my thoughts brimming down. It is much easier for me to describe the pictures in my head, the vivid sensations I am accustomed to beholding within my minds own personal theater. I have developed my own way of thinking, so I like to think!, through day dreams and images, which I behold clearly even with my eyes open as if they happened in front of me. I like to write, but not this droning nonsense which may not receive the benefit of human eyes except for its execution and if, if it gets read. I am told it might not be, and it is this insignificance which repels me to the assignment. At least its easy, except for the internet part.  I have generally avoided this dismal institution for my years, I spit upon the "net" when it first gained its genesis, and I spit upon its multi-media, machination which steals the waking lives from people. But what of it, for that matter, they do it to themselves, I can not pity them for that. If they like computers to sunsets let them use paintbrush to engineer their own nature, but I prefer the real thing made of so much chaos and chance that these simple number-crunchers couldn't make anything with that much sensation, that much depth. That is what lacks in these computers, they are vicarious to life. Not that I condemn them, they are useful tools, and not that I condemn their junkies or pushers for the fact of the creation, and not that I live my life to its fullest potential as it may sound I condemn the computer junkies for not doing. Its just that, I guess, I have found my own niche in the wall of the world, my own peaceful way of doing things that is inhibited by the computer only slightly, in the way that I hate it and most embrace it. I am hypocritical in this matter as well: I own a computer myself, and use it nearly every day. I like to think, probably falsely, that my downfall in the machine is not so complete as those web-surfers who spend 0+ hours browsing the electronic dreams of men. But then, my won mind produces the dreams I live in: whose to say which is worse?   I prefer to see pictures of the world inside my own mind, and I can contrive any number of vicarious situation, locations, persons, emotions, sunsets, anything I want with a near vivid copy of the real things my eyes behold. Is this the same as the infernal computer? Is this any less debilitating a habit to daydream in ways even more real than my own, insignificant life? I say insignificant, and I mean it, not in a degrading matter or that I don't feel I have made full use of my potential or that I want for a better standard or situation in my own life, but that it is the truth that all humans are insignificant, no matter how important or influential, save in the numbers of our immense crowd.  I'm sure philosophers have pondered the subject as I do right now for a useless computer, but as I have mentioned, I prefer the daydream, I prefer the novel, and I prefer the realistic sunset to a game of doom(not to say that the particular pastime isn't fun, I'm just as guilty as wasting an hour or so, but I haven't followed it up as many have with the endless assortment of clones that rock the computer gaming industry). I am bored with writing this as though I think in words, because normally I do not. Normally I prefer to think in sight, in sound, and even smell(though that's a hard one to master, I don't think I shall). So now I think its time to stop this wonderment I have going and describe what I think about when I don't do it in words:   Flashing colors, sometimes geometric-shapes, until I can find something to build the energy in mind into. I remember during psych class when I began to waver off(which I am in habit of doing, sometimes at the wrong moment), daydreaming about my Kendo class coming up soon. I thought about a stalwart master standing over me as I held out a bamboo sword, poised straight and steady. I though about going over the moves I knew so well, I am quite a fan of kendo and cannot wait to take the actual class. I hope, though, that my daydream will predict some of the success I hope to have, but I still recognize that it was not real, only a contrivance, and I will have to wait for the fact to see. back tot he daydream I enjoy remembering, and have thought about since. I then imagined as though I were past the class, but somehow not in the real world as we know it, but somewhere where the sword still ruled the land. I think now it must have been my own idea of feudal LOCNAME, but needlessly I walked around in nothing but a (I forget now what the karate uniforms I have donned so many times are called) but I was wearing one of those, carrying a real sword this time, trudging through muddy roads through a country side constantly lit by an orange, pasty sun.  I can’t remember where it went form there, but needless to say much violence, honor, and success followed. That's how my daydreams sometimes run, but sometime they are more erratic. Sometime I let my mind go, though I do have extensive control, and watch bizarre unfoldings before me of pictures melting together, sometimes a forgotten memory boiling up from the depths of my mind, but more often a collage of unearthly landscapes. I have done extensive travel in the southwest of our country, sometimes willing, sometimes not, and have amassed a great many memories of the landscapes. Enough memories, in fact, to create my own realistically, though vicariously, through my daydream ability. Sometimes I imagine titanous walls of huge cliffs, eaten away by a river evidently, but impossibly showing the scores of rain as though it were eroded by that force alone, topped with greenery though the valley below is of rocks and tumbled stones. I like to visualize. I like to visualize so much that on the last vacation I made special note to remember the best landscapes I saw, and discovered in the process that I couldn't remember the scenes if I wore sunglasses. Without them, I could remember the sharpness of LOCNAME, the depth of the LOCNAME LOCNAME, the crumbling stones of Chaco and LOCNAME LOCNAME. But with sunglasses on, I found I could not remember the details, they seemed clouded and sometimes distorted as thought he glass stole away the true definition of the pictures I wanted to remember.  That is the unfortunate part of my visualizing saga, sometime I mar and twist my own memories into fantastic visages only seen in movies, and then find I cannot twist them back. Sometimes I remember the waves at LOCNAME quite a bit larger then they really were, the sun at the most vivid sunrise I recall that much brighter and golden, though taken from the special effects house and spliced with my memory. and I wonder which is better? To have the memory unaltered or to have the memory better, improved and refined into something so stunning to remember or think about that I might include it in stories. That's how I write, too. don't think out the story, I see though it were a movie flashing before my eyes, I hear it though a speaker were plugged next to me, I feel it though I were in it myself. Sometimes I think about conquering the world, so much to the fact that I have it all planned out. I feel safe writing about here, because it is doubtful anyone will read this carefully or pay attention to it, but I am confident enough of my long-term plans that I would feel bad if someone didn't have the warning. Maybe just fancy, but we will se won't we? If not, then I'll die a normal life, or maybe get a few books out and receive some fame, not as much as I'd like the money though. I'm sure I’ve met the twenty minute interval, but I forgot to check the clock so I'll keep writing a little longer to be sure to satisfy the requirement. So now I will daydream for sure, and write it as I see it, as though it were happening. NO, I better not, it would probably appear too much like my writings, but I will go ahead and make-visualize a new landscapes like I did up there(Earlier) because I enjoy it so much.     I see a rising pyramid, sitting atop a four-cornered stone terrace that hold the point towards a sky with two suns, one burning bright and vaguely familiar to our own, the other a hazy blue color, lazily sitting near the point. surrounding it is the ruins of a city, not Egyptian though, but more reminiscent of the Roman culture, with tilted columns and ruble returning to the desert. The sand is a yellow with glitter, like mica flecks imbedded in the sand, which is hot tot he touch  but not ruff, it runs like silk through the hands. My hands? I don't know, I just watch. The valley surrounding is windswept, though, perhaps they must be my hand because it appears quite desolate. The wind whips the sands into speeding wraiths across the amazingly flat area around, somehow no dunes develop, though. I wonder how that could be. I said valley, but I do not see any moutons or hills around. I wonder what prompted me to describe it as such. If I were writing a book, I would have changed it or added in a distant mountain line, but not so here. The sand seems compacted though, to the foot, though a hand can easily dislodge it, though it seems to flow back into place. It reminds me of the black sands of LOCNAME, more gray then black, but equally as smooth and mica filled. Perhaps that's where its glintiness comes from, a mixed memory of TV and actually physical things I've seen. Sometimes its is, most times, though, it is merely illusion, merely contrivance, so I will let it go at that,  
__label__label1 welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. I don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. I can't recall ever hearing a song that I didn't like on ORGNAME. I think that I'll stay in LOCNAME this summer so that I can continue to listen to it. I really missed it last summer, when I didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do I. so back to the point, there isn't one, PROPNAME is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won’t leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. PROPNAME is not a man. she is the only girl I've ever met named PROPNAME. PROPNAME will not stop talking about her, I don’t know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all I have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. I honestly don't care, adi. I’m not lying, I know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but Americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to LOCNAME. like tonight. I hate the commercials on ORGNAME though. which is why I keep a CD ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt PROPNAME, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, I think. that's really scary, since she's only 00, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and PROPNAME hasn’t been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. PROPNAME has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since I never play computer games or do other things with them. I only check my email obsessively, although I usually don't ramble as much, unless I'm emailing my friend PROPNAME, who I tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as I've learned in past jobs. I've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. I usually sing whatever song is on my mind until I want to kill myself. (not really-which I should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all I can do is sing them over and over again. also I sometimes translate them into French. it always seems like I've accomplished something after I've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least I have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what I type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. Its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. I think I need to hear the new Sundays CD, it sounds really good, at least the one song that I've heard from it. I haven't bought a CD in a few weeks now, my last one being an older Poi Dog Pondering CD that I like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately I only have two minutes left. I wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. I know you can type longer, and I'd love to, except I have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that I have available. so now I'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 00,000. 00,00. 00,00,00,00. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only I couldn't really count down and type at the same time, I'll try again with the ten key. 00,000,00,00,00,00,000,00,00,00, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now I've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you. 
__label__label1 What to write. I just missed dinner because I came down here to write this paper. I think that they should make dinner last longer then just till 0:00 at night. That sucks. Last night I requested that they give us a new couch because the one we have now hurts my back. Besides I saw what the new couches looked like and they are pretty cool. They are bright blue, not just plan gray. PROPNAME is so boring. I wonder what I will do tonight. I could stay home and do my homework and sleep,  maybe get to see what a good night's sleep feels like. But I will most likely go out and party like I always get suckered into. So the guy situation on campus. Not to bad. The one I’m dating now is a sweetie. But now that I’m dating him it is not as fun anymore. Why is that?  The fun part is the challenge of getting the guy but now that I have him I don't want to spend any time with him. I am such a bitch. God, my eyes can't handle looking at a computer screen too long. They get all dried out. We have a ORGNAME at our room upstairs, and I sit there for hours and my eyes kill me. Well, not really for hours, just a little exaggeration. My roommates are pretty cool. I like them a lot. Sometimes I feel bad because I don't spend as much time with them as they do together so now they are closer to each other and I kinda feel left out. But I spent my time with my other friends. My best friend PROPNAME who is just down the hall and whom I love so very much. I am so glad that she is here. I would hate it here if she weren't. When I fist got here I was kinda upset that she was on my floor because I wanted my space and my time away from her, but now I love it. It is a perfect set up. I can go and visit her anytime I want and she can come to my room if she likes but I don't feel like hanging with her than I don't have to. How come I can write forever and this screen just keeps scooting over, it makes my feel like I’m not writing that much. Last time I did this I only wrote one line. And the sad thing was I was sitting at the computer for about an hour. I just had people distracting me. I wonder how you check your e-mail. I wonder if PROPNAME wrote me. PROPNAME is such a great guy. I hope he comes down and visits sometime soon. I miss the boy. He is the one guy I regret not ever liking. I had my chance with him and broke his heart, but I guess that's the way life goes. I always go for the loser guys who treat me like shit. Maybe that's why I never like a guy after I finally know he likes me, he is too nice and treats me too well. Doesn't that suck. I thought that the psy. experiment in class was very entertaining. I hope that I do well in this class it is truly an interesting subject. But is seems like I won't be doing well in any of my classes. I don't concentrate enough. I came down here thinking that I was going to get a 0. 0, or at least close to that. But now my study habits have gotten so bad that I don't know what is going to happen to my. I think that I will change my ways and get back on track. I started out exercising every day too, but now I haven't ran in several days. The freshman 00 here I come. Ok that has been 00 min. Hope you had fun analyzing me! 
__label__label0 Stream of consciousness. What should I write about. Am I supposed to have some kind of direction or am I supposed to write exactly what I am thinking. This feels like a very strange assignment. for homework it seems that it I pretty easy. Actually it would be pretty intense if this was worth more than however much it is worth. Hmm  for some reason I am blanked out, and it seems like I am thinking about nothing. Oh well. Lets see what happened today. I lucked out on my econ quiz, I was actually able to guess my way to a 000. What are PROPNAME chances of that. having faith definitely pays off. I always say that it is important to have faith. That’s my motto in life. Have faith and have fun. Life is a funny thing. One minute your there and gone the next. It is like PROPNAME the PROPNAME PROPNAME for example. He died tragically at 00. I am 00 what happened. Somebody stepped on his fingers. And that killed him. well he was hanging of the 00th story of the hotel at the time. Poor lug. No Poor Mrs. the Lug. Now she is on the streets selling apples. The point is that the lug did not plan ahead and the government got everything. PROPNAME was a damn intense movie. It seems very difficult to figure out what I am thinking. Wen I try I blank out, and I keep trying to figure out what stream of consciences s then. Life is good. This entire internet business is pretty cool. I never would of thought I could write a paper, and then send it to a teacher by pushing a submit button. I wonder how much longer I will be writing this. I only have ten more minutes left. Everyone always asks what you are thinking about, when you are just sitting there thinking. Usually you say nothing because you just don't want to tell them. Now I am trying to think of what I am thinking and I am getting nothing. Cricket is a great sport. There is going to be the LOCNAME cup going to be played in LOCNAME. It is LOCNAME vc. Paistan. One of the biggest cricketing rivalries in the world. Team PROPNAME is going to be victorious. Aamir sohai is a great Cricketer. I can not believe that they dropped him from the team. Granted he was a little out of form, but he would have taken the Indian crap bowlers around the park and back. This is beginning to seem kind of silly. I hope that was your point. I wonder if any body is actually going to read this. For some reason I doubt it. Whoever is reading it though I feel sorry for. That is a lot peoples garbage talk you have to read. Maybe it isn't. I have no idea what it is. This screen is really weird. How come only three lines have popped up. I have been writing for 00 minutes. Is this some kind of ploy so we can not see what we have written. I can not believe that I only thought about that now. In fact I just noticed that only this much was on the screen. Very Very Interesting. I am getting tired of typing. I am waiting for these final minutes to tick away. I hope you gain something out of this, because I don’t think I will. actually I might, but I have no idea how. I was thinking about quitting early, but what if you had some kind of device that told you how long I was on for. That is actually pretty scary. only god knows what technology can do nowadays. Anyway I hope you enjoy reading this. It is quite possible that I have enjoyed writing it. It is fun and relaxing to write something, without having o go back and proofread. It seems like you are an expert typer actually. Anyway now my 00 minutes are up, so have faith and have fun. If you read this give me an A. Even though It does not matter. This completion grade stuff is amazing. All my classes should do it. 
__label__label0 The RTF000 Usenet site is a piece of garbage!  I just sent my first required message, only to have another person's name in the From slot!  Now I probably won't get credit, and worse yet, I can't access it again!  The computers here suck!  It's bad enough I wait in line just to use one. Well, that's it, I have  got to get my own. Or perhaps, bring my old one from home. It seems different, even though basically everything is the same. It's on my desk at home right now. That antique desk where I spent hour after hour perfecting my work,  listening to my favorite music right now. I hear Journey, and String right now, now if that stereo down the hall would shut up!  What are they paying  for anyway?  They come miles upon miles, after earning the right to be here, and then squander it on stupid sound effects, and loud music. If I wanted to hear Inspector Gadget during the PROPNAME’s, I would change the channel!  I only get to watch t. v. for 00 minutes or so a day, and I certainly want to choose, and if my roommate and I don't choose, why should that inconsiderate shmuck down the hall get to!?  Speaking of halls, that turn was so tight in the one off of my computer room. I used to feel plush carpet under my feet, and the cold, refreshing taste of Coke when I walked quickly into the room to begin my work for the night. And all those shows that I missed! I missed countless mindless hours of television. Pure, mind-numbing entertainment, what can beat that. I see industrial carpet on the wall right now. How plush my bed was!  PROPNAME used to love when I gave him nip, or scratched his ears at night. It reminds me of when that  bumpkin exterminator came to the large, clean, inviting house thought he was a bob cat. So the vet called him "big-boned", that doesn’t mean he was obese. So he ate 0 bowls a day, and was a 00 pound cat with a gut. That reminds me of "Cats" when the twenty pounder is the human equivalent of 000 or so pounds. That theatre rocked. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is awesome, but that other guy on t. v. is an eccentric freak. The PROPNAME is cool, I could go for some more hot chocolate now, just like during the Christmas musical we went to. That guy was pretty short who my mom worked with, and bald as a bowling alley floor. I have to play pool before I go insane!  That basement used to smell musty, but the sleepovers were fun.  
__label__label1 I think I have one of the shortest attention spans. For some reason I can't concentrate on one thing for more than fifteen minutes. I was never diagnosed as A. D. D. though. I don't think I'm A. D. D. I just think I don't put forth the effort to concentrate. I was trying to read for English, but I couldn't keep my mind on it for anything. Every time I sat down to read I go sleepy. I try to stay focused, but it's hard. I wonder why my concentration is so limited. I think it all depends on what I'm interested in . I can read things relating to the human anatomy all day, but I have trouble focusing on things dealing with English or history. My mind often starts wondering. I've really had to adjust these first few weeks. Not only did I have to adjust academically, but socially. Even though I have a group of best friends, I still miss my friends back home. My mom, sister, and I are best fri0nds, and it's is pretty hard because I can't just pick up the phone and call them. It took a couple of day for me to realize this. I also have a boyfriend back home. This has also been hard. It's been hard for both of us. We were in the habit of talking everyday, and seeing each other quite often, now he's three hours away. I think he's taking it a little harder than I am. I'm keeping busy so I'm not constantly thinking about him. There's so much going on here. Between keeping on top of all of my classes, and hanging out, there's no more time left in the day. We've been having so much fun. The other five girls I hang out with are great. We all bonded so quickly. They really help to keep me focused on what I need to do. Of coarse with a group this big personalities flare, and we have disagreements, but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out. Females are stereotyped as being gossipy, and shady. Yes we do gossip, but if we say something behind someone's back, you can guarantee it's already been said to their face. So far everything's been going pretty smoothly. I hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years. It's difficult to say if it will because we can't  predict the future, and people change. When we're just sitting around we talk about our future as friends. I've already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding. Who knows when that will be. I don't plan for it to be any time soon, but I do hope our friendship will at least last that long. Friendship is a very important thing to me. It gives a sense of warmth, and belonging. It's like we have known each other for years. I hope nothing, but good will come out in due time. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm sitting in the computer lab at my dorm. I'm really bored and really want to get this writing assignment out of the way. The direction say that I should type for 00 minutes. I have 00 minutes to go. I'm a really slow typist. I was just watching TV with my roommate and then I came down here to check my e-mail. My dad sent me a really sweet message. I really miss him but I'm really not homesick. I'm having a lot of fun up here at school and meeting a lot of new people. I really like all of my classes. Okay, fifteen minutes to go. My ankle really hurts because I sprained it. There were some girls in here that would not shut up and they were really getting on my nerves. One of them just hit my chair as she was leaving and didn't even apology. The letter after y on this key board will not work. Okay, I'm supposed to be living in a really nice dorm and this computer won't even work right. Oh well. I fell really bad for my roommate because she and her mom got in a fight tonight and she was crying when I came home and stuff. She really is a nice person and we get along really well. Only 00 more minutes to go. Well, I'm really excited about the football game this weekend. My friends went and got tickets for me and my roommate to sit with them. We are on the fifty yard line on the first row. I can't wait. My parents are leaving for LOCNAME in about two weeks. They have a huge trip planned to LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, and somewhere else. I'm really excited for them. They need some time to get away. My dad really works too hard so this will be a time for them to relax and have some fun. They just celebrated their twenty-seventh anniversary. I think that is really cool and I admire them for being so happily married for so long. My roommate just came in to check her e-mail. I wonder if she has any. She is now e-mailing one of her friends. I wonder if PROPNAME will call me back tonight. I hope that he is not too mad at me. I guess I find out soon enough. I had so much fun this past weekend. I spent the weekend with my four friends that have an apartment here in LOCNAME. My roommate went home for the weekend so I just hung out with them. We had a BBQ one night and watched movies and went swimming and laid in the hot tub and just relaxed. It was so much fun. I think that I'll spend this weekend with them again. PROPNAME kissed me this past weekend and I really don't know what to think. He calls me a lot now to check on me and to make sure I get home okay and to see what I'm doing and stuff. We've been friends for a long time so I really don't know what to think. Well, my twenty minutes if officially up, so see ya later.

__label__label0 I’m in the mood to write and so I decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes I get in this mood to write anything and everything that’s on my mind. I guess it only happens when I’m bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so I don’t know. how should I describe. I guess I was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being?  why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. you’d think id get the hang of it by now. but I don’t want to become like them. whoever’s reading this. are you PROPNAMEian?  I am. or I believe in God and His Son PROPNAME Christ and I try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet I know I’m doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. I think I've got the harmless as doves thing down, but I’m not very wise. I always get so hurt. I don’t know what to say. my thoughts don’t seem to be flowing and I cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. I wish everyone were. how come I cant think. but I’m supposed to write for 00 minutes so I guess ill continue. no, I’m not totally disappointed with all people or anything if that’s what it sounds like. in fact I love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. I gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet I always for her. she never once cleaned yet I never complained. I bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. I cared for her well being. I never said anything to hurt her. I don’t even know how to describe. I really did care about her well being. as roommates, I thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and I tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. I gave up my bed and moved into the living room  since we had a one bedroom. living with anyone’s mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. I still cleaned. but she did cook. although I didn’t eat at home that much. I tried to go home late and leave early because it wasn’t very comfortable with someone else’s mom at home. I tried my best. and I really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out I noticed I was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, I presumed she must have misplaced. so I left a note before I left for school to check for me - that I’m not sure how many silverware because I lost some in moving before and so its not too many I’m sure, but a few. when I came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, "look! this is ours,"  then another wrapped piece,  saying "look,"  and more and more. I was so shocked. I told her I didn’t mean to accuse her of stealing, if that’s what she had mistaken it, but  she said no, that’s not it  well its been over 00 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and I wasn’t going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. I have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 0nd was only for the summer)and I hope everything goes well. I wrote about this because I saw my 0nd roommate today. and though we never fought I don’t think were friends anymore. and every time I think of her,  I’m hurt. 
__label__label1 I love this song. It reminds me of LOCNAME, and when I hung out with my old friends. I wonder where they're at right now?  I wonder if they're ok, and if they're doing well at college. Where’s my roommate. He should be back by now. He must be eating. I wonder why this c. d. keeps skipping, I know it's not scratched. I can't wait till tonight. I can't forget about my laundry in twenty minutes. It better still be there when I go for it, or somebody's losing a leg. Actually, I trust most everyone on this floor because they're all pretty cool and I've met most all of them. The guy down the hall, he's pretty cool, he just isn't used to LOCNAME life. the heat yes, since he's from LOCNAME, but the people no. Should I rush a frat, or not. There are many great advantages to this, but I really don't want to join a bunch of guys I don't know and find out they're a bunch of losers, or drugees. I guess I'll never know until I decide to join, it's just whether or not I think they're cool. A lot, if not all of my friends, have joined a frat, so I can find out who likes their frat, and who doesn't to figure out which one I'd like to rush or pledge. I'm actually rushing them all, because there is no reason not to. My sister will give me the drop since she went here not to long ago. I'll ask here and get here to help me out because a lot of her friends are alumni's of the better frats. This part of the song is the best. It always makes me feel so happy, like I could do anything. Wait one sec, I have to sing along. PROPNAME, when is PROPNAME going to call back, there are so many LOCNAME people here in LOCNAME I feel like I'm at high school all over again, just a bigger neighborhood to party in. I don't like driving here to much because there are no medians, and the speed limits aren't posted anywhere. I'm not used to having to drive sooo aggressively here. I mean I always drive aggressively, but I wonder if people here take offensive driving, instead of defensive driving. Now it is time for me to go take a safe walk, since my car is so dang far away. 
__label__label1 It is quiet in my room, PROPNAME is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at PROPNAME's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 0 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 0 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of LOCNAME but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . . 
__label__label1 as I begin this assignment its seems weird to me that I am in college  and I locating my professor on the computer I don't have to be in the room  to hand you an assignment I have to get up early for class tomorrow usually I'm in bed by now I don't know why I up, I seem to have this spurt of energy tonight I've gotten so much done tonight though I so stressed out this week but today I realize that I've been stressing over future stuff and I was looking at the wrong dates on my syllabus oops forgot to hit the return button typing is making me so much more tired  tonight when I'm done I will go to bed I love waking up in the morning its such a fresh beginning feeling forgot that stupid button again next door the music just got turned on real loud they better cut it out by the time I'm ready for bed I wish PROPNAME were here to go to bed with me LOCNAME is  so far away at 0 in the morning, not that its any closer at 0 in the afternoon but things are so much more in perspective at that time wow I bet this is really  improving my typing skills, not that they are bad I had that typing class in 0th  my back hurts this position hurts but in 0th grade that teacher what was her name. . . oh yeah Mrs. reader and she had that annoying voice. aaaaaaa now class . bbbbbbb is everyone understanding how to switch the fingers to the right letters? this class psych reminds me of my mom she is a therapist I like hearing her talk about that kind of stuff but I don't like when she uses her therapy shit on me anyway I miss her I hope her business trip is going well LOCNAME seems far away at one in the morning I  wonder why I typed that 0 out and just pushed the one key for the last one? anyhow or anywho I can not stand that . anywho! I am not capitalizing my I's anymore cause I’m tired and you said we didn't have to worry about grammar well I have two minutes and to tell you the truth I am now ready to quite and  go to bed. 
__label__label1 Well this really pisses me off. I write you assignment to send to you but I get no connection. So I save it and try to do send it again. It got lost, even worse I have to do this again just turn this stupid thing in. For something I have already did, this really pissed me off. So to make sure you get this thing I'm thinking about emailing this to you. And to think I actually did truly analyze myself for this project, tell you my true feelings and you don't even get to see it. This is what is really going in my sub- consciousness. You well probably are not going to get a  memo like this class. Too bad, I really had a great paper or memo you could have really thought about. It was about time, and since I have to do this the Second TIME, it's  even hardier to write about. Speaking of time I have about 0 minutes left so here it goes. I feel that time is one  of the most under-rated things in this world today. Just  look at me I'm writing this memo for the second time today and have to do the other one tomorrow. Now that was a lot of stress for just one day. Still I accomplish more things under pressure, I think that is what I'm best at. Well it  is time for me to depart, so I hope I well learned something in your class. Man, this really is stress releasing. 
__label__label0 " Stream of Consciousness "  Everyday about now, I am still sleeping. I feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but It has not hit me yet. This morning, while watching ORGNAME, and still seeing the coverage of Princess PROPNAME, made me sad. It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. He had ten hours of surgery. What pain I thought. I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live. Why not someone like Princess PROPNAME who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. She did so much for other people. She even raffled her dresses of for charity. What a women. I'm feeling a little bit tired now. The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment. I enjoyed it. I sat next to a cute girl. I hope today's classes will go fast. I would like to take a nap today. Just to sleep and rest for an hour. It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. It was a nice surprise. Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday. I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. An example is I worry about friends, family, grades, whether I am behind or don't understand something in a class. I also do not like change. I don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times. I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech. I continue to be nice to him. I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. He can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. Sometimes I'm angry at him and sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I don't. I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it's nice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He is a nice man. I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. I do not get along with him very well. Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it. I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. I miss my dog. He is so cute. I didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents, but I have not heard him recently. When I visit home in a couple of weekends, I would like to spend a little time with him. He is a very nice and loving pet. He is old but still wild. I hope my girlfriend comes home with me. She said she would. Her father is coming up to LOCNAME on Thursday and we are going to dinner with him. This makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? I think. I miss my family. They are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. I hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. I have not given my ID to anyone. I will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. Sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. Maybe I won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. I will see. I hope to watch Melrose Place tonight. I have a lot of homework but I hope to watch it anyway. I have a lot of reading to do and I hope I complete. I think I will or come very close to it. I sometimes do not feel 000 percent. Right now I am getting a little tired. I think I might nap after lunch. I think we are having steak today. I usually think of steak for dinner but I guess it is okay. Yesterday I read for a long time. I didn't get as much reading done as I would of liked, but I am trying to keep up and I understand most of the information in the readings. I have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. Maybe I won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. I would get a lot done because no one would be here. I am more tired now. I hope today's classes go fast and I have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! I hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. She is truly my best friend. Guy or Female -- I think she is my best  friend. Another best friend is my friend PROPNAME. He is nice and I have known him since third grade. I am probably going to pray later today. I was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so. 
__label__label0 well t. Today is Monday and this has been a really shitty day. This is my 0th time to turn in this assignment. Right now I am at my boyfriends house b/c my computer was as getting interrupted by the phone ringing. I did not know how to turn off the call waiting. So every time that I was going to turn in the assignment the phone would ring and I would have to start over. Well let's see I am from midland and I come from a family of 0. there are 0 boys and 0 girls. There names are PROPNAME(00), PROPNAME(00), PROPNAME(00), PROPNAME(me)(00), and then there is  jimbo (00  PROPNAME and PROPNAME are my half brother and sister. There last name is PROPNAME, there grandfather is PROPNAME PROPNAME a sculpturist who passed way not too long ago. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are both graduating in December. PROPNAME is majoring in art, and PROPNAME in Sociology. PROPNAME is also getting married in May. PROPNAME is the majoring in engineering. He is so sweet!  Then there is me, a sophomore here at ORGNAME ORGNAME majoring in ORGNAME ORGNAME. My little brother is PROPNAME, he is going to school in LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. He is playing baseball at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I hope he does well. So all 0 of us are in college right now. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and me all go to school here at the university of LOCNAME, and PROPNAME in LOCNAME. I have two roommates, they are cousins to each other. I lived with them last year at the dorm. Things are going okay I guess. They can get really annoying sometimes. I am glad that I have my own room so I don't always have to listen to them. Because they are cousins they tell each other anything. I mean that they will fight about anything. They will say things to each other that you normally would not say to a roommate, like you are being a bitch or that looks like shit on you. I don't know I just don't like listening to them all the time. They share a room and I have my own, thank god!  I hope things will start settling down!   
__label__label1 stream of consciousness - well, The first thing that comes to mind is why exactly do I have to do this? I know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. I am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. I want to become a doctor but then again I want to be a musician too. I mean I have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. I want to continue but a part of me is saying - You need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! I want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. I don't know what to write about anymore! I'm laughing at myself because whatever I am typing I am literally reading it out loud to myself as I write it. I'm thinking is that normal? Anyway, I'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and I am amazed as just how fast I type without formal or informal training. I then think about how blessed I am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once I figure out which dream is possible or realistic. How do I know that my major is the right one? I mean, I am now a microbiology/pre-med ,major and I don't know if that's my fate. Should I be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. I am looking at how long I have been typing. Only 00 minutes. The phone just rang and I had to answer it; I hate that happened because I was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if I would write continuously. What am I talking about? Well, anyway, I enjoy music and stage. I like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. My contacts are bothering me; somehow I have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, I was just disturbed for about 00 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his Ethernet card. But guess what I am almost done . I just have a few more minutes. I don't what to write about. I hope that this class is going to be very beneficial. I hope to learn alot because psychology, esp. the physiological aspects really interest me. I'm wondering whether or not I will get an "A" this semester for PSY 000. Well, I'm done! 
__label__label1 I'm wondering how long it's going to take me to find a girl I really like and if girls look at me as cute or a skinny dork. I miss my dog and the country life I use to live in. I'm scared of not making the baseball team and not completing my goal of pitching in the majors. I'm pissed off at my parents for not getting me a new car for graduation. I'm wondering if people act like they're cool with me when I'm around and make fun of me when I leave. I wish I had perfect teeth so I wouldn't have to get braces. I'm wondering if I'll ever forget my first love and if she'll ever forget me. I wonder why people look down on pot smokers even though their parents probably did it. I wonder when I'm a upper classman if girls will want me more and if I'll look different. 
__label__label0 Here I go. I keep thinking whether or not I am doing this right. I can't seem to spell anything right. I am going to correct all my spelling after I am done. This line just keeps on going. There was just a commercial with people that that said "I am in the woods" and it sounded like the other add that says "I am Tiger Woods". I am so glad the ORGNAME won today. I am not even looking at the screen now, because I was losing my concentration. Only 0 minutes have gone by. I wonder when my roommate will get back. I still don’t know why my phone won't work. This line just keeps on going. It is a little bit hot in here. I am getting tired. I sure am glad I got this chair. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. I wonder bow many of my friends are in LOCNAME now. I had a dream about PROPNAME again last night. I wonder when I will see her next. I sure wish I could type better. Now it has been 00 minutes. When is PROPNAME going to call. It is 00:00. Time sure does go by faster here. I need to think about all the  things I need to do tomorrow. But I don’t want to. It has almost been 00 minutes. I am anxious to mail my letters. I wonder if I have any mail. I just found food on my shirt. I wish I had something better to eat. I wonder  Oh there showing the tennis highlights now. I am glad that PROPNAME is doing better. I am noticing that I am writing "I wonder" a lot. It is starting to get harder to type now because I am getting tired. I think the twenty minutes are up. I am stopping now. 
__label__label0 I just got done watching "First Time Felon" staring PROPNAME PROPNAME. I was very moving. I'm cooking stew right now on the stove. I learned how to cook it from my father. He taught me how this summer. Earlier today, I did this writing assignment and after completing it, I pressed clear instead of submit. That sure got me upset. Anyway, I went to class today and the lecture was funny. The phone is ringing right now. The phone is still ringing. There, someone finally picked up the phone. I have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. And in two weeks I'll start having my first set of tests. They all fall on me at once. When I think about it, I don't want to study. But thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. I kind of enjoy it. It was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. I remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. That was a really nice view. I wonder how the stew is doing. Hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. I see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. I really miss him. He was like a brother to me. We always looked out for each other. I'm really good friends with his brother too. He is a good church-going person. Faithfully believes in God. Well, I haven't talked to either of them for some time now. Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow if I have time. My girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. It was just a message. I really miss her. She is back in LOCNAME. Her birthday is coming up on the 00th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. The problem is that I have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. I wish I could take the tests some other time. Oh, well. That's life for you. My brother landed an internship with ORGNAME, but hasn't started work yet. I wonder when he will start. His future looks bright for him. I can hear the T. V. downstairs. Some cartoon show is playing right now. My roommates are downstairs watching it. I can see my keys from where I'm sitting. They are attached to the Pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. Actually I have two key chains. The other one is of PROPNAME. A total stranger gave it to me one day and I've never seen him since. I like to think that it was PROPNAME himself, giving me strength when I needed it the most last year. I was feeling down and out last year. I was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. He walks up to me and gives me the key chain. He tells me that Jesus will never turn his back on me. So every time I look at the key chain, I think of Him and it gives me strength. School is finally underway now. I hope that I do good this year. Anyway, the 00 mins are up. Hopefully I'm doing this right. I know that this isn't even for a grade, but I just worry a lot. Speaking about worrying, I'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because I've been calling back to LOCNAME everyday. 
__label__label0 ok, go!  00 minutes, and don't stop. what do I write about?   I have laundry  in the washer. I hope it doesn't shrink. band was fun. only a couple of days till our first game!!!

__label__label1 Ok, I am really happy right now because after 0 weeks of BS, I've finally got my computer and Ethernet working so that I could do my psychology  homework. Cool, huh. Well, my best friend from LOCNAME LOCNAME just called me  and told me she's gonna get a tattoo, which I think is pretty dumb  because she's gonna be stuck with it for the rest of her life. See,  I would get a tattoo, like my zodiac sign or something, but I just  always see myself all grown up and old and wrinkly with a tattoo and I think I would feel pretty dumb for getting it then. Like,  right now I just have my ears pierced once in each ear and I’d  like to get 0 more in my left ear and 0 more in my right ear but  its still kinda like I’m gonna be to old for that kinda stuff in a  few years, you know?  What else can I bore you with?  Oh, my mom sent  me a package and I got it today, it was my dry cleaning and some pictures of my dog, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, he's a basset hound. PROPNAME is  a family name, its my granddad’s and my older brother's middle name. Hmmmmmm. . I'm like so happy that tomorrow is Friday, not like I’m stressed out or anything, its just a huge adjustment to go from partying all the time in the summer to only partying Friday and Saturday night, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't  go out on school nights. I really don't have much self control or discipline, but I’m working on it. I was so happy last  night, I was in my next door neighbors room and everybody was  checking their email and I was just like no, no one has emailed me, but I tried anyway and low and behold, one of my best friends from LOCNAME LOCNAME had emailed me, I was so surprised. See, he was  suppose to move to LOCNAME, NM but it fell through when he  got there so he came back, but he's moving to LOCNAME in a day or two but he told me he was going to be back in El Paso for thanksgiving except he didn't have a place to stay, and I really hope my mom doesn't  mind, but I offered to let him stay in our extra bedroom. Oh, then I  did one of the stupidest things I’ve done in a while, I told him  that I’ve had the biggest crush on him since the day I met him,  GOD I'M DUMB!!! oh well, its over and done with now, can't change the  past, huh. It'd be cool if you could change the past though cause god knows I’ve done a whole lot of dumb things in my life. ok, sorry, my  twenty minutes were up 0 minutes ago so have a nice day. Bye   
__label__label1 They are playing OU as I write this and I am hoping that they loose. I keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down I really want them to loose. When they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. Is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him?  I know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. This makes me extremely jealous and insecure. PROPNAME is my first love. He is the first person I ever really cared about. I don't know if I am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. There are so many more important things that I should be worrying about right now in my life. I am in my prime. I am terrified of getting hurt. I'm scared that I am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when I really need him. I can almost see history repeating itself:  in high school I stood beside PROPNAME when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where I needed someone there for me we was too good. I still have a tremendous amount of anger towards PROPNAME for the things he did to hurt me. This relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but I'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that I would be willing to lay down my life for. I don't know if I am being insecure about our relationship because of things PROPNAME has done in the past or because I feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like I am not worthy of someone liking me. 
__label__label1 However, I feel I could be falling into a trap that could severely effect my grades. My roommate is a friend from high school and unfortunately for me he likes to stay out very late. I have early classes and it is starting to take a toll on me. It doesn't seem as if there is enough time in a day. I am looking forward to playing club volleyball here and I really enjoy the coach. Volleyball is by far my favorite sport. I need to start asking some girls I have met out on dates. I am enrolled in a dancing class with one of my girlfriends and I am having a lot of fun with it. My parents are coming up to see me tomorrow and will be bringing my bicycle with them. It is funny, I love my parents very much but I really don't miss them. I don't have a desire to go home any time soon. My suitemates are having friends stay the night and I hope that they will not be too noisy. After the football game tonight I think I will do some homework and go to bed. I am looking forward to this psychology class. I find it very interesting so far. I need to be sure to keep up in my reading. 
__label__label0 He will be nineteen this Saturday. I think I am going to go crazy trying to get something for the boy who has everything. He just left my dorm room. and we just had a fight. he is going to his apartment to check if his dog made a mess on the carpet. I think he likes his dog more than me sometimes. I am listening to the soundtrack of the tape that I do yoga to because it soothes me. when I do yoga I am so calm. I actually feel very centered and like my whole body is in a perfect line when have finished the whole tape, its an hour long and it really is a workout. my mom got me started on yoga, she's totally addicted now. I am too, but I'm going into withdrawal because there is nowhere in the castilian where I could do it. I am going home to LOCNAME this weekend and I'll get to see my whole family!!  my mom will make some really good dinner for me because she thinks I'm starving here. I'm not but there's just nothing good to eat. everybody loves the food that their mom cooks them though. I went home last weekend too. the people down the hall are being so noisy . I want to change this CD, I think I just fell into a trance. I do think I was in a trance this morning in biology. my roommate was up until 0 this morning doing some paper and she kept waking me up. she takes a lot of my stuff without asking , and that's not cool. Oh well , she's cool otherwise. I've got other homework to start now so I don't keep her up tonight!!! 
__label__label0 I thought I could cry forever and I wanted to until I feel eased and better. I guess that made me feel at least somewhat better since I don't feel as depressed or sad right now. I saw mo and ricky this morning. mo probably thinks I've gotton weird, edged, or I don't know, just crazy and there's something wrong with  me. yeah. there's definitely something wrong with  me. I wanted to talk to him so much. I miss him so much when I don't see him and I don't see him as much or at least I don't try as much to see him or hang out with  him. before hanging out with  him was one of my better comfort or pleasure, but it hurts me now to him. he is, to me, one of my best friend and I care for him a lot. I want the best for him and he doesn't deserve a person like me. I am so confused. I am so depressed. I know that I should talk to people about it but it isn't so easy after all. connie doesn't understand or I know understand her. I tried so hard for her but she seems so insensitive or she is being a jerk on purpose to be insensitive to me. I don't even think she knows what she's doning to me. God please help me to get through this time. I truly believe that only you could help me and pull me through this misery. I miss feeling your awesome love. I feel so lonely. I feel bad but I can't really talk to my mom about this my whole crazy situation. she expects so much out me. she loves me so much that it hurts her so much to see me being like this. but Lord, I really don't know what I can do. I don't think I am capable of doing anything well or at least I don't have any desire to do anything. I thought mom was okay with  elementary education and I thought I could do that, but she says, "no, no!" to it. what can I do?  I really want to be the daughter my parents want me to be. I really want to be a friend all my other friends want me to be. I really want to be a sister sungmin and sungchan want me to be. but most of all, I really really want to be someone that I want to be that will please everyone and the most of all You. I am so confused. Lord I don't know what to do and this makes me a sad, depressed and unhappy person. I don't have any motivation to do anything and this is so hard because the school has already started. whenever I feel like I want to cry or feel down I want to go to certain people like timmy, steve, mo, betty, connie, mom, and etc. but timmy, as much as I want to go to him, I can't for some reason. instead, I'm so mean to him. I don't mean to be. I hope he knows it. I wonder if he still likes me. I sometimes feel like he does, but I don't think so anymore. guys are so frickle. steve. I want to but I can't depend on him too much because he will be married soon and I shouldn't be near him so much. mo. I want to but you are one of my problems. why can't you be just a friend to me. betty and connie. I shouldn't talk to them so much, in fact, I kind of regret telling them so much about me. I shouldn't have. oh well, they are my friends and I hope they don't ruin my trust on them. well, I feel so much better just writing about everyting or most of the things that bothered me for so long. I guess my 00 minutes are up. maybe things will be better today. 
__label__label0 I called her to ask how to cook a  roast. I think it's funny how much I still depend on her - how much I still need her. I call her almost everyday. Sometimes just to hear her voice. It seems to comfort me and I don't really know why. Thank God she has a  0-000 number at her office, otherwise I would have to call collect and she probably wouldn't appreciate that. When I put the roast in the oven, I  started to think about all the meals she has ever cooked me. I wonder where she came up with all of her ideas. I only know how to cook three meals, and  they are not even that good. I wonder if my mom was born a good cook. She  probably was. That's what my dad says anyway. I kind of hope she wasn't  though, because then there might be hope for me. She told me that she taught herself. I hate when people say that. She had to have learned how somewhere. Maybe my grandmother taught her. She told me that she didn't, but she  probably did. My mom doesn't like my grandmother, so she probably doesn't  want to give her credit for anything. I guess I don't blame her. Now the  roast is starting to smell good. I love it when you come home and the whole place is filled with a mouth-watering aroma. Delicious! But it always smells the best when you're the one who is cooking. I wonder why that is. Maybe  it's because you-yourself created it. It's your own little personal accomplishment. I can't wait to taste my accomplishment. 
__label__label1 I even went to summer school here in the ORGNAME ORGNAME and I still find myself in amazement sometimes. I am adjusting well-- a greORGNAME deal better than my mom. That could be because college is something I knew I had to do and the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME has always been the place I wanted to be. My classes are okay. I have a sort of messed up schedule. I really cannot complain. Tuesdays are the only days that totally messes with my mind. I cannot seem to get signed up for a research experiment in LOCNAME. I have went by a numerous amount of times. I like to get things done ahead of time. I am just now doing this because the lab is always full. I am too lazy to go to the one at my apartment complex and when I came to the lab yesterday I totally messed up on the waiting list procedure. When it asked for your name, I put in my name instead of my if account. so I couldn't log in and it assigned my computer to someone else. When I used the lab over the summer I never had to get on a waiting list, so I did not know. I did get quite embarrassed though. I did it right today. But I guess I did not anticipate doing so, I did not bring a disk. As far as I can tell though I don't need one to complete this assignment. so let's see, school is doing fine. I am having roommate trouble a little bit. I live off-campus and I have 0 roommates. Well, 0 of us get along fine. But one attends ORGNAME and she is 00 years old (boy, does she act it). Well, that is the only thing that is bothering me. I am stuck with her for a year. She lied to get in our apartment and now we are stuck with her. Oh well. In my Philosophy class, which I just left by the way, Professor martinich is so interesting. He wrote two of our textbooks. He' s real perceptive and insightful. I am taking Philosophy of Religion. There are about 000-000 people in the class, so we have ORGNAME ORGNAME. I hate my SI. We are supposed to discuss and we actually get graded for it. But, I don't fell comfortable doing so. I love to talk and I have plenty of opinions, so that's bothering me. The only thing I can come up with is that when talking about a thing like religion everyone comes into the discussion with strong opinions. Like last week, we basically argued. I made a comment and they looked at me like," Boy is she stupid. "  I don't  like that. Even the TA acts like he has his own views and those that are against the grain aren't worth listening to. He questions your comment and accepts others. I don't  know. I am thinking about talking to Dr. PROPNAME. I guess I'll give it one more try. that was just the first one. I shouldn't get counted off for being in an uncomfortable environment. 
__label__label1 I believe sometimes I think to much about what's at hand. I always have to be scheduled and know what's to come. I wonder if its just good discipline or if its a problem. For example its the first day of class and I'm doing the writing assignments already, it was my mind so I did it. My mind is wandering, I'm thinking about my girlfriend at home and what she is doing and thinking about, hopefully me of course. What are my other friends doing that went to others schools, do they feel pressured. What am I suppose to be thinking or typing about. I wonder if your looking for any certain topic we should be thinking about. Am I going to do well in this class, will I get an A, B , C, D, or even fail? I guess I will find Out Eventually. 
__label__label0 first of all I don't have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and I can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. I am worried however about how well I do in college. although I did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how I cram all my assignments into the night before it's due, I plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends I don't think I'll have much time to do studying or productive work. I am hoping that by writing all of this down, I am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness I can't help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since I'm in psychology, I hope that doesn't mean that I'm going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and I feel many of holden's feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off!  back to college, I hope that I can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now I'm listening to red hot chili peppers. I don't know what that tells about me, but I love their older songs. I can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh!  four more minutes. I don't know what to write. I have so many thoughts but they're not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it's the first day of class, that's on my mind. the crazies passing out the Christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because I'm catholic. what pisses me off is that they're so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!)  that disgusts me. although I do drink a little, I don't go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. I view many of their views such as religion's role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning  then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability  of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we've had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions I see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their religion) that Catholics worship PROPNAME when in fact we pray through her. they see that as a way of discrediting Catholicism by pointing out verses in the bible stating that "thou shall worship no other god than me"  or something like that. 
__label__label1 I think that I am just supposed to write whatever flows from my mind for this one, so here I go. I really like the theory that writing about a problem helps you sort it out. It is interesting to me that putting that problem onto paper helps symbolically remove it from the mind. Theories like that always seem to capture my imagination, I am a huge fan of symbolism. I miss my girlfriend a lot. I think about her multiple times each day, she just pops into my head all the time. I wish I could have called her today, but I just didn't have time. I just realized that I called her my girlfriend. I guess we are broken up now, but more because life drew us apart than any conscious decision. I am dying for some reason to call her and tell her that I love her. I haven't said that in a long time, I think it will make her incredibly happy to hear it. I hope she hasn't given up on us, although that is extremely unlikely. I have not been able to talk with her much lately because she has been grounded, but when we spoke the other day she still sounded like she cares. We've been through so much, I think she always will care about me. It seems almost corny to say "We've been through so much" because everyone says that about their sign. other. But with PROPNAME and I it's not like we've just been through a time where we fought with our parents or ended up almost splitting up, we have walked as close to Hell as I care to come. There are still some things I hate remembering and I block from my mind. Every now and then I will remember something which seemed to have vanished from my memory and I am amazed I didn't remember such intense emotion before I was reminded. I suppose it is repression, it is very odd. I don't like to think about a lot of the things we went through, it's just an emotional roller coaster I don't want to ride again. I still imagine myself with PROPNAME automatically when I think of the rest of my life and who I will be with. I cannot wait until semester when we can spend more time together. I just got a flash of memory of what it is like to be a couple who sees each other and spends together a lot. I miss her being an active everyday part of my life. She is still an everyday part of my life, but only in my thoughts. Not in physical reality. I will definitely call her tomorrow, after my dreaded chemistry test. I am sure I could be studying so much better right now if I had talked with her today. I am scared that when she finds out about PROPNAME it will hurt her incredibly, the odd thing is I would do it again. But it remains to be seen if I would do it again after we talk. I feel so out of touch with her. She changed so much in the wake of everything that happened I feel like I need to get to know my best friend again. I am sure that her core personality is still the same though, I just feel weird because we have both changed and grown so much apart from one another, I am scared that we grew into two people who aren't supposed to be together. 
__label__label0 I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to ORGNAME because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 00 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 00 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to LOCNAME. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 00 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. 
__label__label1 at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in LOCNAME or if I should return to LOCNAME and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 0. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like PROPNAME or PROPNAME or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. PROPNAME is the only person who I can count on and maybe even PROPNAME if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       0. get a 0. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the LOCNAME area in case I feel the need to leave.    0. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 0 pack by years end if it kills me      0. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      0. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) 
__label__label1 Towers seemed to have gotten an illness thORGNAME spread very quickly last week. Only difference is everyone felt like crap for a day maybe two, I was sick for four. However, I'm feeling better so perhaps tomorrow is my last day. My mother brought some Echinacea- it's an herb that supposedly helps during the cold and flu season. I pray it does the trick. I am extremely excited about this upcoming weekend. I get to go home- LOCNAME. Isn't that strange? You're supposed to go to college and never want to leave; here I am jumping up and down at the very thought ORGNAME home. Unfortunately, the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME doesn't fit like I thought it would. The university itself is awesome. My professors all seem great and the classes are interesting. The main problem exists at home- University Towers room 000. I typically refuse to stereotype- but I'll make an exception. Most people here are self-absorbed, fake, rich kids. I care more about people and their life experiences. They care more about what you drive or what your father does for a living. Oh well, at least I'm not in this alone. One of my best friends from LOCNAME isn't content here either, except she is at ORGNAME. My roommate, PROPNAME, is really sweet. (I went pot luck). She lived in LOCNAME most her life but her dad got transferred to LOCNAME, so she moved as well. I love hearing stories about the differences. She went to an American school so it's not like she learned Dutch, but still the opportunity was once in a lifetime. My parents moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME only a month ago. I was able to visit for a week early this summer and sure enough It Was Beautiful. My dad works for ORGNAME ORGNAME and was offered a promotion, salary increase, housing/driver paid, among other things to work in LOCNAME. So they went to check it out and discovered it would be worth it. That's crazy to me. They are 00 years old and completely changing cultures, countries, etc. In a way I'm thrilled for them. Yet, my sadness that they're 00 hours away overcomes that. It's not all a sad story though. I have a gorgeous place to visit for Christmas vacation (there it will be spring I think) and my parents and I are going through life changes at the same time. Also, my house will still be there; my oldest brother and his wife are moving in. So I have my oh, so comfortable bed to retreat to at Thanksgiving. This is strange to me. a writing assignment that doesn't require revising and outline and spell check. Actually I like it more because I feel like I'm talking to someone. I'd much rather talk than write. English is my least favorite/worst subject. I do well in math but I don't like it. History is okay, depending if the teacher makes it exciting. Science is the best. if I weren't so crazy about dance and teaching I'd become a chemical engineer. But I believe I'd get bored of that job real quick. Well, times up. I'll sign off and go study. 
__label__label1 I have a paper to start writing for English, and I'm dreading it because it will be very hard. It's about the short story "A Room of One's Own" by LOCNAME LOCNAME. In that story she also wrote in sream of conciousness so that is kind of weird. I really do not like the book at all. It's incredibly boring. It takes a feminist standpoint of women writers, and since I am not a feminist and only took that class because it was all that was open (I wonder why),I cannot relate to the anger Woolf seemed to have about there not being many women writers. Now, I am trying to figure out exactly what else to write about in this paper. It is really hard for me. I did the other assignment first because I found it much easier to do then this one. I don't completely understand exactly what I am supposed to be writing about, but we did stream of consciousness in my AP English class last year, and I think that it's all about writing exactly what the thoughts are that come into your head as they come into your head. My geography class is awful. the teacher is so boring. I've almost fallen asleep every time I go into that classroom. I decided to sit closer today to try and pay closer attention to what he's saying. I wonder if it's just a myth that the closer you sit the more you pay attention. Maybe that could be a psychologiacal survey we do- if one has not already been done on that. Now, I have again drawn a blank in what to say. it's so much easier to think when you don't have the pressure of having to write it down. I think my fried PROPNAME is mad at me. She goes to ORGNAME, and I had to write her an email about ORGNAME's unfortunate loss to ORGNAME yesterday. It's not like she hasn't made fun of LOCNAME. I feel like I'm back in Jr. high!  PROPNAME and I have been friends forever- actually only since 0th grade but it sure feels like forever. I miss my friends at home. I feel like we've gotten so distant from each other and it's only been a week since I left. I talked to my friend PROPNAME last night, and she was distant to me also. We just didn't have much to say, our lives are completely different from each others now. It's so weird how much people change from each other when you change their surroundings. I guess we were so much alike because we were constantly together. that could have a big effect on things, huh?  I wonder how long my friendships with people will last. The only one that seems to be maintaining right now is with someone that I wasn't even very close to this year- it's so odd to me how that happens. This twenty minutes sure is taking a long time to end!  I have to go put some money in the bank today. Actually I have a ton of errands to run today, but I need to finish my homework first. I still have a lot of pages to read in "A Room of One's Own" even though it was supposed to be read by today. Oops!  Then I have that awful paper to write over it. I mean who really cares about PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME? I don't even know how to start writing it, I don't even completely know what I'm supposed to write about. Well, it's been twenty minutes and my thoughts are becoming jumbled so I'm going to stop writing now. 
__label__label0 Although overall, I am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. I'm actually on my own. I can't believe it - for the first time, I won't have my parents to rely on everything for. I'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. And I think I'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. Even though I've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. I still would've preferred going to the college I wanted to go to, ORGNAME ORGNAME I guess I'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, I'll just have to accept it. Right now it's late, almost midnight. I am tired and I have so much to say right now but I just can't get it all out. most of what I think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what I actually want to pursue in my education. Do I really have the commitment to study medicine? What am I going to major in? I'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. A lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. Right now my parents are preparing for their trip to LOCNAME. They haven't been there in 0 years. I feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. Somehow I feel my parents' families resent me because I was actually born in LOCNAME. Also, I don't really feel "indian. " I am American in the full sense of the word. That's been a huge conflict I've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. The indian community I have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which I dislike. So I find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. However, I find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because I act different. I don't always hang out with Indian people. In fact, I rarely do. Strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by ME, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. I don't know why I can be so bitter about this subject. I guess I just resent the idea of the Indian culture trying to shape my life. I am about ME, not about being Indian. Ok now that I'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, I'm going to complain about something else. How about religion? I am very proud of the fact that I am a christian. However, my parents don't seem to believe I am religious because I do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. I am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. It's the same way with the Indian church I used to go to. I left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. Church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. As long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. I couldn't stand it so I left for a better church. Spiritually I am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. Right now, my roommate is out partying and I'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, I don't really feel lonely. I actually like being by myself. With others sometimes I feel like I have to act like I'm someone else. Alone, I can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but I feel like typing more. I wonder if people think I'm some kind of nerd or recluse. I hate when people assume that about me since I'm not a party person and I do well in school. I really am different from most people, and I like that about me. When I get married and have kids (IF I even want to have kids), that's something important I want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. That's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and I don't care what other people think. maybe I'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think I have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. I really do have a lot of friends. basically I look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person I want to befriend. So as I'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, I have to express a couple feelings. I'm excited about my new beginning in life at LOCNAME. I'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. I know I am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, I think I must end this. ok no I wont, haha! I still have a little more to say. I am a night person. I don't know why. but I just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. I feel like I can do things I couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. I wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? I know I'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. I wonder how much less people think of me because I am fat. I am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- I'm not dieting because of what other people think. I KNOW it's not healthy for me, and believe me, I intend to live a long healthy life, and I need to start. sometimes I feel I am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. I don't intend to be a statistic of the "freshman 00. " well, with all that said, I am ending this now. 
__label__label0 I feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes, but at the same time am overjoyed to be here. I spent a year at PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME for my freshman year of college and liked it alright, but the school was not right for me, I think it had more to do with the town than the school, but anyhow I like being in LOCNAME and love being around old friends, but at this moment I feel as if I haven't gotten into the school year just yet. I haven't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient, worthless. But I don't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year. Two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me. Right now I feel relaxed, relieved to be through with classes today. tomorrow is another day and I feel like I have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished. Another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment. This is the first day I have been able to get into the ORGNAME computer library and luckily I made it in before the deadline. I tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines. These are SO much better than the computers from SFA that I think I shall nut my pants. one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles, such as uncapitalized letters, lack of punctuation, all borders are allowed to be crossed and I love this freedom. I am feeling very good about myself right now I have just completed my first assignment of the year, well almost completed. I hope I have done this right and this has actually been fun. I look forward to writing on this assignment again. I have 0 more minutes to write I think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer . I am thinking about how this will be graded . I wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what I am writing in real time. and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not . I think I may stay here all day I like doing work and doing work well I am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that I may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors. I love school what else do I need to accomplish? I have to sign up for some experiments as well I'd best do that also. I am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed. I think I have wrote enough but am not sure. so anyway I am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime. this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced? experienced, and to learn how the brain works is good to, and to learn how the world works , that's good to  I love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane, I am wishing I had a disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style I like it I am going to do it again, . goodbye I am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes. I wonder what I will wish I had accomplished when I look back ten years from now. like I look back and wonder when did I think I would be right now ten years ago? hmmm that's ponderous man really ponderous. I am glad to be here rather than home because at home I can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that I have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes. like if kori came over I would never do homework again. yeah. 
__label__label1 I work at a daycare in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday before class and friday after class. During the day I am in my classes and at night I have meetings or readings to do. I am sytressing out right now, and I am trying to not think about how much I need to do. Each time I finish with one task I feel a little better but after a few minutes I get stressed out again. I can not wait for the labor day weekend though, because I am going to spend some of time catching up with all of my readings and some of my time just relaxing. I think after ORGNAME day I will be relaxed and I will not be so stressed out with all of my work. I like my job in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday, I work at a daycare for infants. I work with the two months to two years, from eight in the morning until twelve-thirty in the afternoon. I like working with that age of children, because they are so trusting. They are away from their parents, but they still are so relaxed and trusting with all of the teachers at the daycare. I feel dumb writting this, because I have so much going through my mind but I can't write it all down, because most of it is the same thing over and over. Wondering how I am going to finish all of my homework and go to work and go to my meetings. I geuss for the most part I am just stressing out because it is the begining of the semester, and my goal for this  semester is to make at least a 0. 00. I feel that if I get behind at the begining of the semester, I will never be able to catch up, and I will not reach my GPA goal. I am a very opptimistic person though, so I know that if I keep up with my work I will be able to reach my goal, and maybe even get higher. Another thing though is that I should be a junior in years, but I am nine hours short, so over next semester and the summer I have to catch up, so that I can graduate on time. I am not worried about that, I am more concerned with my grades, because I know that I can catch up in summer, and next semester. I feel a little bit better no that I have almost completed this assignment, so that is a little off my head that I do not have to worry about. Now all I have to do is read 000 pages for three more of my classes, and do the pretesting, although it won't let me on right now. maybe when I am done with this assignment I can get connected to the pretesting, but if not I will have to wait for tomorrow to do that, because right now I have to go buy some more books. Then I have to go eat, because I have not eaten all day and after I eat, I have to go read about Russian ecconomics. After that it will be time for class and then I have the pre-law fraternity meeting tonight. After the metting I am going to go home and go to sleep right away, because I have been up since six in the morning and I am tierd now, and I still have laods to do. So I am done with this for now, I have to get started on the rest of my schedule.  
__label__label1 I'm sorry, but I just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. Where does that come from?  What, is it inherited, or something?  Do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell?  I just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings?    I can't wait until it's my birthday. I can finally watch Titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. PROPNAME. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure PROPNAME. Ahhhh, pure heaven. I wonder how people like him handle their lives. I mean, I don't know what I would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. My life would change so much; I'm not sure if I would like it very much. I hate the media. They make so much out of the stupidest things. Why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money?  It just boggles my mind. It's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many "Smiths" there are in the world. O. K. So, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. Seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. And, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. Hell, even I do sometimes. All those sleazy magazines that say stuff like "see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 00 arms and 0 eyes. "  Crazy stuff like that. It's ridiculous. But, I must admit it is pretty humorous at times. I know when I'm in the grocery line, I browse over the titles just to get a laugh. I can't believe it's already 0:00. Where did the day go?  Why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. It's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the "time flies when you're having fun" does not necessarily pertain. Well, I guess it could. I don't know. All I know is that even when I'm not doing much, the days go by faster. That kind of scares me in a way. I have so much I want to do with my life, and what if one day I wake up and realize I haven't done a thing. I mean, what if I went to the doctor today, and they told me I only had 0 weeks to live?  Then, what would I do. I wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that I've always dreamed of. I wouldn't meet the man I am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. Three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. That's awful when people find out something like that. I couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. I still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 0 months to live, and he lived 0 years before he died. But, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning?  I remember the last time he went to the doctor's. He sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. First of all, how can any one approximate someone's life?  But, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 0 months to a year. He just shook his head, and said "no. That's not going to happen. "  He said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again. 
__label__label1 At my high school I graduated with a class of 00, and most of my classes were comprised of 0 to 00 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 000 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy "college life". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to ORGNAME ORGNAME last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. 
__label__label1 The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 0 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in LOCNAME. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at LOCNAME it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. 
__label__label0 I guess it's just freshman blues, but it seems to me that everyone here knows their way around and feels comfortable. I miss my family and home a lot. my courses seem pretty easy except my psychology course. I didn't realize how much I had forgotten of the precalculus I took in high school. I miss my high school crush. He comes here but I haven't seen him. Oh, well. I can't wait for this week to be over. I get to go home this next weekend. I was extremely bored here in the dorm over this past weekend. there was absolutely nothing to do. I don't know what else to write about but the assignment said not to stop so I guess I won't. I just realized something about myself,  I can't let myself misspell a word even though the assignment said not to worry about errors. I am getting slightly annoyed by some of the people in my hall. They are very loud and I haven't slept well the past few nights because of them. I really hope they don't get loud tonight. I really need a good night's rest. My chemistry teacher is so funny. Not because she has a great sense of humor because if she does I wouldn't know but because she has this thick French accent. it's just refreshing to hear someone that sounds a little different than everyone I know. Speaking of which, it is extremely difficult to meet people here. Sure everyone seems friendly but there are some very rude people as well. I guess I'm just too shy for my own good. I don't suppose I'll ever grow out of it. I didn't use to be this shy. I don't know what happened. I wish I could graduate from this place already. Granted, I've only been here a week and a couple of days, but I was recently reminded how much I hate school. I think I've figured out a way to graduate in three years with my ever so special degree. I hope I make a lot of money when I graduate so I can rub it in my brother's face. He graduated from college about two years ago and he thinks that because he's making thirty thousand dollars per year that he's rich. well I will hopefully be making about forty five to fifty thousand dollars per year starting out so maybe that will make him hush up. I'm still not sure if I want to continue to pursue this particular degree or attempt medical school. I did a bunch of research this summer and discovered that almost two thirds of all those who apply to medical school get turned down. I would hate to come to the end of my four years here and not be able to continue with my plans. I would cry non stop if I didn't get in because then I would have to go and find a job and wait for an entire year before reapplying to a school. It would be sheer agony and I don't know if I could take it . Plus I think it would disappoint my parents and it would just give my brother one more thing to throw in my face. Well it's just about been twenty minutes so I think I'll go back to my exciting life of doing homework non stop and feuding with my dorm neighbors. 
__label__label0 I just got out of your class after watching the video and I was disappointed that I couldn't do a personality survey. I really wanted to do one. I like to find out things about myself that I might not have been aware of . yesterday I bought a postcard that had my horoscope sign and a description of the characteristics people of this sign have and I thought, as it usually turns out to be, that this card just about pin pointed a lot of the qualities that I have of course a few things were off the mark for goodness sake we are more complex than a few words that tell everyone born within a certain time span who they are, what they should be like, and what they would be good at. I'm really tired I wish I could fall asleep and not have to worry about any assignments. gosh we have to read for every class every day. I'm also taking sociology so a lot of the stuff in psy are the same, but obviously both sciences don't agree. I wonder how I'm going to keep all the facts straight. my soc teacher is boring cause he teaches straight from the book he makes me sleepy at 0:00 in the afternoon how is that possible?  my other classes are cool because teachers teach from the book but insert their own ideas an anecedotes. which I like a lot. I wish I knew how to approach my professors and to just talk to them. I enjoy talking to people but classes this big don't really allow you to. I'm also intimidated by the professors for goodness sake we can no longer say miss or Mr. now its Dr. I am so not used to that. I feel so dumb and in awe by them. maybe that's why I can't figure out a way to approach them. one of my instructors on the first day of class called on me first and I was kind of sleepy and gave a partially correct and that sounded stupid and I heard people giggle. gosh I felt dumb. I still can't forget about it. it's like one of those experiences that everyone else forgets except you and you still think they remember. twenty minutes of writing is a lot of time but I just looked at my watch and I only have 0 minutes to go. I love psy. I love to give advice and find out people's personalities but ironically I'm not trying to pursue a career in that. maybe later I'll change my mind and do it  who knows. all I want is to graduate but it's no longer like high school. now I'm not sure if I'm capable of succeeding. I want to succeed but with A's and without having to  study so much. high school spoiled me got used to getting by with out studying. but now it's a whole new adventure. 
__label__label1 so I'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. I have no real plans for tonight so I decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that I'm going through right now and yes I am going through a lot of personal problems but I don't want to write about those because I've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and I sort of get along but I'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares I went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country I mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about I mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and I'm not having much but that's another story. I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 00 minutes and I'm tired 
__label__label1 crit. term; it is weird how we hold on to memories; or even more depressing is the idea that I often want something so bad only to realize, why'd I make such a big deal in the first place?  regardless, I caught a lot of criticism from people in my town on attending ORGNAME; I come from the "bible belt" and well UT@Austin is not the ideal "institution" in that I was often told "they are really liberal up there" or "watch out for those weirdos"; ironically the bible belt has one of the highest alcoholic rates around, goes to show how prevalent hypocrisy is no? that goes to say; oh I am reminded of Plato/Aristotle's "allegory of the cave"; I say UT as a place to "get out of my cave" and as PROPNAME PROPNAME says, "you can never go home again" semmingly depressing at first, this statement became quite refreshing to me;; I mean aren't I here to "find myself"; it is weird I made such a big deal about being one of the like 0% that will not change their major (business) but now I really want to major in English and Theatre and teach; however it is quite a "campus issue" in that my parents want me to do business; in a way expectations can be bad, I mean think about it, when people expect too much from an individual they feel obligated to live up to those expectations in which failure is not an option *sigh*; and is never being satisfied a bad thing? if someone "settles" for something are they compromising themselves? or just being content? or can it actually become an obsession in which you never get anything accomplished? be that as it may I think one should never put themselves in compromising situations; like my two really good friends, who are girls, I often hear stories about how nice a guy was to them. I get soo aggravated because I know the guy is just "giving them a line"; sadly, I relish in the idea of "I told you so" and I often make or ask my friends to humor me and say "cornell is right, cornell is always right"; these two friends are high school friends and that is definitely a dominant fear in my life as of yet; they say you never really keep in touch with you hs friends but rather that you make all your friends in college; oh well "que sera sera" or something; oh PROPNAME PROPNAME, music is slowly losing its place or relevance in society; I was raised on 00's and 00's music; I love to find people my age who know songs from that age. I'm soo AFTER my time. :); I think that life exp. shape a person; I mean the first five years of my life are a blurr (misspelled that word in a 0th grade spelling bee *sigh*, but I beat our hs valedictorian that year. hehehe) anyway due to like divorce and other problems I don't feel like disclosing; I fell I matured more quickly than others my age who come from "functional families" or whatever; my favortie saying is "well if I'm too big for my britches, it's time for a new pair of pants" (I made that up. good no?); and furthermore I think that people are brought together by life exp. For example, my "lunch table" consisted of people/friends that were all from broken homes. but I can honestly say it is pretty neat now because as a result of divorce I have two great sets of parents; and with my parents the respect is still there, yet is like we are all like friends; I can tell my parents anything. well not anything; but it's like we have "grown up" conversations and stuff; and those who are sheltered are really going to have a hard time in life. because out of resent and curiosity they are or may go crazy after hs. hmmmmm that's just my opinion I could be wrong. but that very seldom happens :) 
__label__label1 Err:000
__label__label0 I guess I'll use this space to rant about this topic. Yes, I used to have a car. She's a silver-blue '00 Camry that my mom bought when I was in first grade. She was the first new car my mom ever bought, and I think she made a good choice. She bought a new Camry in '00, when I turned sixteen, which, by the way, is the nicest car I've ever had the pleasure of riding in. Strap $00,000 to the dashboard, and you have a Lexus. But anyway, I drove the old Camry, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (after Nine Inch Nails' debut album, which is awesome)until I went away to college last year, on my little sister's 00th birthday. So you can probably guess what happened to her (the Camry, not my sister). Yes she got two huge dents in it, running into the same garage behind the restaurant where we work, a garage around which I have managed to maneuver countless times without causing bodily harm to Pretty Hate Machine (which my sister so rudely calls "The Velvet Rocket!!!"). OK, I crashed her once and busted her right headlight, but it wasn't my fault, and the other lady's insurance paid for it all, and I felt terrible for putting her (the car) through all that. PROPNAME showed not the slightest sign of regret for her thoughtless actions, having no respect for Pretty Hate Machine.    She's such a great car. First of all, she screams "MOM," so I never get pulled over in her, not even during the six months she had a busted headlight. She might as well have vanity plates that say "MOM, RN. "  Second, she's the most reliable car in the world, which is one of the reasons I felt bad when I crashed her, because she's not used to the shop at all. No, she's never broken down. She's got 000,000 miles on her, yes, she's "been around the black" a few times, rrhaha. She's never broken down. Third, I love her because she's idiot-proof. She doesn't just have that beeping noise when you don't fasten your seatbelt;  she turns the headlights and the dome light off when you leave the car, so you'd have to be worse than an idiot to run out the battery, which my sister did I might add. And you have to lock it from the outside, or else 0 door stays unlocked, so you can't lock your keys in her. She's the perfect car. Oh, and since she's so old and a 0-seater, she's cheap to insure.    Yes, I have a sort of sick emotional attachment to her, but she's just so awesome. She's like an heirloom, having been in the family long enough to serve two generations. I get to drive her whenever I go home, which is nice. It's hard to take her for granted when I don't get to see her that much. Oh, I forgot to add that We took our family Christmas card picture in front of, with me holding the keys out in front of my face. There was this really cute boy in high school named PROPNAME PROPNAME who drove the same car, except he had the windows tinted so that he could drive and be sketchy at the same time, I guess. Anyway, I thought he was cute, and the fact that he drove such an awesome yet practical was somehow really sexy to me. And this summer There was this guy named PROPNAME who worked at the same restaurant I did back home who drove the exact same car, except his was more gray than blue. We somehow a big kick out of trying to park our cars next to each other, or opposite each other, or in some geometric configuration. What really kills about her is that every day when I pass by the ORGNAME on the way to class there she is, parked right there, the exact same car, taunting me, torturing me. I miss my Ol' Girl. 
__label__label1 At this moment I,m really thinking about what I'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. I missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. I'm munching as I do this assignment, but I don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but I don;t know why. What is it with these computers anyway, I've been screwing with mine for three weeks and I can't figure it all out. I hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. No where can I find my freaking e-mail to check it. I don't even know if I really have an address because I registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. I figured out why food and computers don't mix. My fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. I like this assignment- I/m getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. I knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. Now maybe I'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. It must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but I would probably have fun because I'm a camera hog anyway. I should have paid more attention in typing class. I know I'm not using the right "home keys" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. I hope I don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because I'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. I feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but I doubt that they are home and studying like I am. My Mom didn't call back from work. She may not have even got the message thyat I called. Mail takes way too long to get here from LOCNAME. I thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. Today's THE eighth and I just now got stuff from tyhe second. Tomorrow is PROPNAME's birthday. I guess I'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. If I was her age zi don''t know if I would want a big sister. I guess it might be neat. I hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. I don't know what she does withall herw time. She always studies but she never gets anything done. I don't do much of anything, but I always getstuff done. I guess it's time management skills. I sleep too much. I think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?  
__label__label1 Far too many thoughts are running through my head right now. Too many things changing all around me. My main concerm=n is PROPNAME. I know it is crazy for me to think that the two of us can stay together through the year but I want to so badly. he is my best friend and there is no way I can just let myself lose him. I am just so worried about everything. we are fighting an awful lot lately vecause we need to learn to get adjusted to all the new things around us. why in the world is he at LOCNAME. He just settled there which makes me so diappointed because I want him to be happy. Not just settling someweher cause he feels like he has no other choices. And then he goes on about there not being anyone there who doesn't drink and so in order to not be alone he hads to go out with these guys  why can't he just gove it some time. He'll meet good people eventually. he just doesn't want to be alone like he was for most of high school. I can kind of understand because  he spent so much time out of hat he considered the loop. I can't really say much because all my other friends are at LOCNAME. Heck I'm even living with one of my best friends. I knew that would be a mistake but I just didn't have t eheart to turn her down so I siad we could be suitemates, not roommates. still a mistake. She is always in my business, never a moments peace. It doesn't help that she keeps aksing about matt. The sick part is that she has always liked hikm. he used to like her which makes it even worse. And she keeps trying to stay in contact with him which pisses me off. I know I can't tell him he can't talk with her but it seriuosly upsets me. especially cause she keeps busting in here asking me all kinds of questions about us. She doesn't know how much of a private person I am about certain things. If I want to talk I will share anythign under the sun. but I hate beign pressured to talk and I hate not having my space. She doesn't understand. I am a hard person to live with because I am so picky about everything. I like things my way. so livign with others is often hard. My roommmate and I get along great cause we give each other space while always being there for each other when we need it. It neat cause we hadn't met unitl last week and yet we already work on much the same level. So the whole lindsay thing just adds to the mess with PROPNAME. I am very insecure about him going away. really scared about the whole situation so it doesn;t help when I feel my best friend is after my man. I know he has nothing to do with it but why couldn't he just ignore her for me, for us. I know it is not good for us to fight like this and I don't want to but sometimes I just start expected too much. Ridiculous things that no one can be expected to live up to. but that's the way I am, I figure if I can do it others should be able to too. On that I amn very wrong but it still bothers me. I want my baby to be happy and I don't want us to trap each other in a relationship that isn't healthy but I'm not ready to let go. I still think that if we just get settled it will all work itself out. I just can't have PROPNAME behind me all the time interupting our conversations. I just feel that he always has to go before we can really finish somehting. And then there are my parenst who are so weird. now that I am gone they try and contact me more. They I'm and email but never call. then they blame nme, why haven't you called. well first of all yall are tryign to see me more than you did while I was home, secondly, wy don't you call. That drives me crazy. I really don't miss anyone except matt. That isn't really suprising to me though because I have never been one to miss my family . And most of my really close friends are here. Which is interesting in itself. LOCNAME is the last place I ever thought I would end up. I always wanted to go to PROPNAME and then on the last day I suddenly changed my mind. Not sure all the reasons why. sometimes I say it is because ORGNAME had the program I wanted, at PROPNAME I really didn't have a major. But other times I think I was just too chicken. Too chicken to pick the harder school. I knew I could handle it but I didn't know if I wanted too. Then there were my parenst who for some reason pushed ORGNAME. Not gform the beginning, but somewhere along the line, I think when my dad saw the scholarship. Then he went form die hard Rice to, "I think you'd be better off at ORGNAME. "  I didn't want to do the same things my friends were doing. I wanted something new. And heere I am with one of my friends in the same room. now that is a stretch. My best friend other than matt is PROPNAME and who knew but she pulle done of the same things and ended up at LOCNAME too. So really there is no one to miss except my baby and iZ am takign that really hard. It's hard to believe  I acn't see him until Christmas. And talkign over the internet just isn't the same. I just want everything to settle down and my emotions to caslm down so that I am not so fickle with everything and don't act irrationally. I never mean to hurt him but PROPNAME today Irealized that I have been. Now as I talk it sounds like we shouldn't stay together but we have sommmuch fun tigether and I think that this is justa phase. we are both stressed. I hope my roommates don't get all weird on me and start thinkign I'm getting depressed. I really just need some space and a little time to adjust. 
__label__label1 well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games. I went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 00 minutes. until writing #0. 
__label__label0 I'm supposed to be writing from my stream of consciousness. I guess I'll find out how random my thinking is, as if I didn't already know. I really like this CD too bad this is his only one. I wonder what CD I should listen to next. I should try to call PROPNAME again. I really want her to come visit me up her. I know how much she likes LOCNAME. I'm really glad that I didn't buy those tickets for the ORGNAME ORGNAME since now I have a math test that night. I wonder when the concert starts. I really do want to go. And the concert is the day after my birthday, it would be a present to myself. Plus, I've been waiting 0 years for them to play in LOCNAME. I really like this song. This room is rather boring. We definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls. I have to make a list of stuff to pick up when I go home, otherwise I will forget everything and I don't know when I'll be going home again. I think I'll listen to ORGNAME next. I haven't listened to that CD in awhile. I'm glad I decided to bring the CD with me. Today is PROPNAME's birthday, and PROPNAME's. I should send PROPNAME a card. I wonder if PROPNAME got the one I sent her. I need to get a prepaid calling card so I can talk to her. She needs to come visit me too. I should probably email her again. This bed is so hard, it's making my back hurt. But I have to admit, it's not quite as hard as the one I had during orientation. You would think the mattress would give some after having so many people sleeping on it. I miss my bed at home. It's so comfy. Wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden. I think that this is one of the coolest assignments I've gotten in a long time, it's much better than all the busy work I had to do last year. My mom will be happy to know that I like my psychology class. I won't be talking about music all the time, I'll actually have something related to my major to tell her. Well I think that's been my 00 minutes of truly intelligent thinking. 
__label__label1 Wow, here is Friday night and I'm doing my psychology assignment that was supposed to be due yesterday. I remember setting all of ORGNAMEse personal goals for my four glorious years at college, and here I am in week three coming to the not so surprising realization that these goals were totally unrealistic to begin with. Why do people even set goals?  Goals lead to expectations, expectations lead to disappointments. PROPNAME, one of my personal inspirations founded the great religion of Buddhism. He came up with the not so clever theory that those who desire nothing are never disappointed with life. I think most of us had that one figured out in Kindergarten or perhaps I was just exceptionally bright. As humans we set goals because we find ourselves having nothing to do, and because we fail to accept the fact that we have absolutely no control over our future, which makes man totally uncomfortable. Our technological advancements were not necessarily for the good of humanity but instead to compensate for our innate fear of nature. It's ironic because most Americans have adopted the religion of Christianity, and according to Christianity God created earth and all of its creatures, yet we put absolutely no faith in nature and certainly not in mankind. We're supposed to believe in that which we can not see and yet we can't even trust what it is we do see. Man is full of hypocrisy in every aspect of life. Some are better than others but in the end we're all hippocrites. More specifically, Christians in general are very interesting group to observe. Every Sunday people enter a building to worhip and praise God. They may sit in a pew for an hour but does this hour really change anyone's life?  Most people struggle simply to stay awake, to walk away getting something out of the sermon is just too much to ask. Sadly enough most people think that because their religion is the "chosen" one that this hour makes them better than those who choose to sit at home and watch ORGNAME the ORGNAME. As much fun as this tangent I've been getting on really has been my twenty minutes are more than up. So we'll just continue this . what is this they say. next session. 
__label__label0 We went to LOCNAME LOCNAME today as a sorority, and met a bunch of my new pledge sisters. I just pledged PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I absolutely love it. Today, we layed out beside the pool, which really has lake water in it,and I nearly fell asleep. When I put my feet in the water, it felt like I had just breaken through the top layer of Ice, and now my feet are in the water below it, like a pond that had been frozen over. It was really neat to see the different type of people that will soon become some of my best friends. Hopefully I will have gotten a tan. Yesterday, I went to the football game and met my boyfriend and his family there. He lives in LOCNAME and is a senior in high school. His brother is one of the starters on  the football team, so it was really neat to see him play. I sat with my boyfriend and his family, which I hadnt seen in a while. Later on that night we went to his brother's apartment and hung out. I was so happy to have seen my boyfriend. He's an incredible guy. Anyways, I could go on forever. My feet really hurt today from these little pieces of wood that were on the ground, and when I walked around with no shoes, it did not feel good. Right now, I am looking around my room and it looks so much different than it did a week ago, when I had not yet pledged a sorority. Everything I have now is zeta stuff. It really is kind of neat. I love being in a sorority. It's really a good chance to meet people and feel a sense of family even when you are away from family. Speaking of family, I really miss my family. My parents are divorced, and my dad lives in LOCNAME. My mom lives in LOCNAME with my two younger brothers. They miss me so much. Especially my dog, who uses the bathroom all over the house just to show us when he is mad or upset with us. My mom said that lately he has been doing that. I guess its because I left him. I always would play with him, such as throwing a frisbee and play tug-o-war. He was so attached to me it was unbelievable. Everywhere that I went in the house, he would follow. I love dogs. I can't wait to go home and see all of them. My brothers really miss me also. They don't have an older sister to boss them around anymore. My mom really misses me too. I was the only daughter, so she was very attached to me. She calls me about 0 times a day, and emails about 0. I guess as time passes by, she will get used to me being gone, but right now I don't think that she has adjusted very well. But I guess that goes for all moms when their children go off to college. And its kind of funny because I was really scared to come here. I have heard its just so big, and the sororities were so cruel. I was frightened. I had always wanted to go to ORGNAME, because I am definitely the more conservative type, but I have amazed myself in that I absolutely love it here. LOCNAME is such a neat town, and there is always something to do. In LOCNAME, we had to sit and figure out something to do on a Friday night. Most of the time, we never came up with anything. Here in LOCNAME, there is not one night where nothing is going on. There's a ton of good restaurants and fun places to go to. Especially LOCNAME LOCNAME, it was a great place to go for a picnic on a Sunday afternoon. I have family down here in Austin, so it is neat to have a place to go. I feel much more secure. They are about 00 minutes away, which is perfect, because they are not too close, but they are close enough for me to drive over to whenever I get sick of the campus. My cousin, who just got back from a mission trip in the LOCNAME, will be living at my aunt and uncles house next year while she is working at a church. It will be neat to finally be living in the same city as her. I have always seen her on trips and family stuff, but never have I actually been in the same place with here for more than a week. So I am really looking forward to the friendship and bond that we will be making this next year. I am hoping that my year goes good and that I can keep up with all of my classes. I am planning on going to all of them, and trying not to miss them. I also really want to keep up with the reading and stuff, so I wont be as stressed out at exam time. I am looking forward to this next year, but I know it will be a hard adjustment and a huge challenge, but I know that if I work hard and put my mind into everything, I will do great. 
__label__label0 well I don't know what to say but I think I should start by sayin I'm really beginning to appreaciate the little things of life. I always have but learning about the body is facinating. the brain especially. there have been times when I feel things and wonder, but I'm now getting some answers due to this book. the class we havnt learned much but the book I've gone ahead. i think about all kinds a things. mostly music and social justice. besides psyc, I got bio which is boring so far but I know I like it . my other classes r mexican american study classes which are all intertwing, or overlap. i think college is coo so far, but for other people I'm sure its harder for others. u se e I've always pretty much been alone, besides my mom. my parents divrced when I was 0, and ever since then my father figures have been in a almost constant shuffle. from my stepdad, to my uncle, to a rapper that I consider my biggest influence, and the last 00 years later my dad. i feel alota anger deep down but have always been able to control it. most of the  time but we all have outlashes I guess. now I am just starting to reach a stable state,,I'm here finally,,no more anticipation,,I'm off weed and drinking,,but the main issues are always family and my lady. shes still in san jose, ca where I'm from. i don't know if I should be faithful or what but I think so. weve talked about a lot a things in our year together and I've taen a lot a shit out onher. i miss every0 a lot but I'm a strong person that can overcome it. always have. adversity is a part of my life that I take in stride. u have too. i see all these others here adapting and hardly any look happy,,they look all fake but maybe its just cuzz I'm on the outside just the way I like it. i'm a chicano here and it seems 00% are all white and 0% asian, 0% black , and 0% other. i also don't like it cuzz I havent really been far from campus cause no car and its to hot to take the bus. I love the bus cause I get to see all the poor people that I love associating wiht. the other homeboys and girls in the struggle or the older mexicans. u can learn a lot from talking to strangers or just observing. thats what I've always done at home and I look forward to doing it here. thats y I came here instead of miami,,cause theres mexicans here. i got a lota pride and love for my people. thats y sometimes my relationship tears me apart. my lady is white. i don't know how it happened,,we started as nothing and ended up being perfect. but llike everyhting I think theres a reason and I know if its meant to be I can work through it. i liked the part of the text that talked about anger and the balence of hapiness we all achieve,,,money doesn't make any0 better. in y opinion its almost like it makes potentially good people worse. but theres always exceptions. power is the other main curropter. or do people currupt power,,,who knows. i've always known that sensations were the vary things to guide ur life. they come from somewhere and I couldnt say where. i think god. gods everywhere. i don't go to church but in my heart I'm going the right direction, doing the right things. thats y u feel what u feel. ur direction and what u want to become. people don't realize that. and sometimes unfortuanatly people are very impressionable. especially in our society, putting aside color, gender, socioeconomic, everything,,,theres very few people that fight through it. i know iam 0 but I also know its harder to stay on top than just getting ther . i look forward to proving that I belong here 
__label__label1 I am in the library trying to get my work done but I keep on thinking on what else o need to do. I hope I get adjusted to college life quicker so I will not be as stressed out as I am now. I am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, I hope that they are all doing well. Some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and I am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow I have to essays due for one of my classes and I kind of do not understand them. I will be glas after I take my first tests and ace them all. Everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so I am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. I have been sleeping late and getting up early so I am tired for class but I have to force myself to stay awake and focus. After I am done writing this essay I have to start doing all of my other work so I can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. When I get home I have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. I have to watch what I eat or else I will put on weight and not be healthy. That will affect my studies and others. I hope that my family is doing well because I know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. She already has a stressful life working 00 hours a week, driving home 00 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. I can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that I have to do. When I get out of college I hope to accomplish many of my goals that I have set for myself. Like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great ORGNAME, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. I hope the relationship that I am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. I am greatly attached to my girlfriend and I hope that I will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. I will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well. 
__label__label1 I'm going nuts. I haven't gotten anything done today except a shower. I didn't get my parking permit. I really need to get that so I can have my car on campus. That would make my commute to work in north LOCNAME a lot less painful. I can't stand riding the bus back and forth. I never know exactly when the bus will arrive. If I'm not there right on time, I get stuck for another half hour or so. I just really want my car here. I also didn't get my Physics books returned. They cost me approximately $000, and they're doing me no good. I'm being booted out of my physics class cause I didn't take calculus. I didn't know until last week that calculus was even a prerequisite. That's ok, though. I didn't really want to take physics this semester anyways. I kinda like this basic, cool class schedule I have. I did get in touch with the guy in charge of the anthropology department, so I can add that cultural anthropology class that I wanted. I hope that will be a cool class. I hope I'm not really far behind since I missed the first two weeks of class. It sounds interesting though. I need to get this class to stay a full-time student. If I'm not, my financial aid will disappear. I also need to get a work/study job for my financial aid. That's another thing I could have done today, but didn't. I went in for an interview at the counseling and mental health center with a ORGNAME ORGNAME, but she never showed up. That was very discouraging. There are a few others that I'm interested in. I like the idea of doing nothing for $0. 00/hour. I could be an Entrance Monitor at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Weee! What fun. I don't think that will happen though. I just would like to have a job on campus so I can walk there rather than having to take a bus there or to my car and then drive there. That would be so much of a hassle. And, knowing me, I'd be late a lot. I just wish I could work somewhere on campus. It would make my life easier. I will miss my current job at Sunglass Outfitters. I really like my boss, and my co-workers are pretty cool. I also work right next door to a Thundercloud Subs where I get free food when the night manager's there. He's a really cool guy. He has had a glass eye since he was 0. He's got some crazy stories about that eye. One time when he was 0 he replaced the eye with a cherry, stem and all. He scared the hell out of his grandmother because the stem was just sticking out of his head. It was pretty funny. His girlfriend one time made the mistake of asking him to keep an eye on her books. You can just imagine. He's cool. I will miss hanging out with all of those guys at the arboretum. Oh, well. Maybe things will be cool at my new work/study job. Whenever it is that I find one, that is. I should probably get going. Maybe I can still return my Physics books. It's not too late, I don't think. The other things I have to do can wait until tomorrow. But not much later than that. Oh well, everything will be ok. 
__label__label1 last night was pretty good and all. I was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it. but who can blame the guy, weslaco isn't exactly the place one would want to be. I just feel bad for junior, he feels totally alone and stuff. javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all, but junior never talks to javi because he doesn't like what javi does on his spare time, so because of that, he doesn't talk to him as much. I was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk, I miss that guy a lot, I just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something. he isn't working or going to school, hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning. all I could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself. hopefully he'll be here in austin visiting soon. speaking of getting off your ass, I need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating. high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through (a walk in the park) but college isn't the same, needless to say. dad said this is the rest of my life I'm preparing for, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because I'm being lazy. I miss dad, and mom and everyone else. yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we're family, only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it. much like me and my friends, because friends are family too, even knowing more about you than you might through observation. regardless, I love austin, its a great town, there is so much to do, and a lot of time to do it in, but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation, because too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I hope grandma is ok, I miss waking up and telling her "buenos dias, como manecio" and her being amazed that I'm even at home and even more amazed at the time it is that I wake up. I just hope nothing happens to her. I feel sorry for mel and all the trauma that she is probably feeling. she just had a kid, her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with, and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her, as well as the threats, in order to get her to tell them the information they believe she has, but which in fact she doesn't. because no matter how bad the news, she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother would know, because she is like my oldest sister, and she is probably the closest cousin that I may have. damn, I miss georgie. stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it. procrastinator in the making just like me. I miss listening to my punk and ska with him, he was the only person that liked it as much as I did, and I didnt even force him to like it. funny now though, in austin one would say that its a bit "trendy" to like this music, but in weslaco. its not really known. and even less played on the damn radio. speaking of radio, it sux. except for some stations in austin. and I don't know the call letters. I'm bad at remembering things. I guess that may be why I procrastinate. my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as I do, so I know he doesn't believe me when I say "I don't remember". but in fact, I really don't, and its not because I drink like every day or because I'm on a drug, because yes I do drink, but not in large quantities (binge drinking) like some people and I only do so on the weekends strictly never on school days, and I don't do drugs. speaking of drugs, I knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them, but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away. already I have open invitations from people I've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them, and one guy who said he could get me any drug I wanted free for the first time. I can just brush these things aside because they don't interest me or anything, but I get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation, but I don't let that bother me, because if they are going to judge me from what they hear and not by who I really am, they arent worth my time. my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said, and I never have. some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before I had ever met them. now we're as close as brothers in a sense. I love my friends, I don't really know what id do without them. my biggest fear doesn't seem to be what kind of future I have or if I will ever be successful, or if I will let my parents down (god forbid though), but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again. but when I think about it, its the stupidist thing, because today, the world is smaller than ever, and anyone can be found with the click of a button. so I don't really know why I feel this way or anything, nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way, so I don't really have an explanation for this feeling, and being the smart ass that I am making fun of everything with a comment for everything, this really does scare me 
__label__label1 Alright, today was a pretty boring day. I feel really unsatisfied with my classes because they do not stirr any special interest in me. I thought I would be excited about at least one of them but not yet. I guess I am just a little mentally tired. I was so happy to get back into the swing of things and try and find my friends. Acutally I think I expreienced a fake high because I miss LOCNAME a lot. I was there for the last half of the summer and made some amazing friends. I miss my boyfriend there too. I keep wondering if he is going to send me the ring he supposedly bought for me. Hopefully he will. I really want it. He told me he loves me, so I just hope he does not forget about me because I will never forget about him. he was so nice to me. All of my friends like him and besides the whole , he has two kids, thang everything is alright. I learned from him that no matter how serious skeletons in your closet might be, your heart wins overall. You cannot talk yourself out of loving someone. I guess I really cared for him more than I ever cared to admit to my roommate who thought I should of broken up with him. Too bad she ended up traveling around with some random guy around LOCNAME who she met before our language was over. Her guy has had at least 00 partners. If anything, she shouldn't of met her lover boy in LOCNAME, MX. As for the rest of my dating life which seems to be my main concern these days, it is hella-active, like PROPNAME would say. This weekend I met some awesome guys. I am waiting to hear back from them. I can still hardly believe that I gave my number to a cute waiter at LOCNAME. I must be crazy. I usually just date around. I would love to find just one special person. I also need to workout more. I have been partying too much. LOCNAME was one big one month long party. Now I need to get serious about studying and try to find some interest in my classes. Everything seems to be running in circles in my mind. I am constantly thinking about boys, classes, and my friends who I really need to call and catch up. I can hardly believe I haven't talked to my closest friends in a month. it really feels good to get back in touch with them even though it is only over the computer. I am soo tired. I wish I could just take a nap and wake up stress free. All of these issues running across my mind are really stressing me out. I constantly feel tense. I hope I do not end up with some horrible health problems like my dad's family. Today at work we had to take a personality test and I scored high in a section that appearred to be Stress. I do not know what the category was but it started with an S and I am starting to stress out about even that. My body hates the beginning of school because everything feels so out of wack! Man, I already need a vacation. I am too tense for a 00 year old going on 00. Surprisingly I am not so nervous about the begining of the year but I can feel the potential homework overload slowly stressing me out. I am scared about my classes and I really need to get motivated instead of nervous. Writing down my thoughts is starting to stress me out. I am going to be so happy when I can submit this and check my e-mail. Then I can hear about my crazy friends' lives and take a break from mine. boo I have to wash my hair too and that is such a chore too. I wish I had naturally straight hair and legs as built as my dad. Then I would have hardly anything to worry about. I feel like such a basket case because I hardly voice my inner thought to anyone and I can hardly stop. I guess I usually set mine aside in order to enjoy a small vacation from my life and enjoy hearing from others. I really want to talk to my friend PROPNAME tonight. She helps me forget about everything and just laugh out loud and be abnoxious without being self-conscience. My laugh is louder than the average laugh so people usually stare at me when I open my mouth and chuckle a little. I saw people looking at me tonight at dinner when I laughed. Oh well. They must be jealous, yeah right. I need to live a little. In LOCNAME I did everything I could ever dream of doing. I climbed a volcanoe, developed a love of horsebackriding, enjoyed my daring side, and much more. It sucks to have to slow down for school and dive into reading material I would rather use as a pillow. Oh well, my studying today will pay off tomorrow. Right? right. I need to take a nap. I did not get enough sleep last night and am drifting into lala land slowly. There is a fire alarm. I have to run. It just stopped, maybe not 
__label__label1 Ever since I came to LOCNAME about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in LOCNAME. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. 
__label__label0 I want money. I like money. What is the easiest way to get it?  Winning the lottery is too hard. Maybe I can get a wish to come true. A wish. Where do wishes come from?  I hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards?  Where would one find a leprechaun?  If I found one, how could I catch it?  It must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. They must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- I wonder if they drink. A drunk leprechaun. Funny,  The life of the party. Granting wishes for everyone. What wish do I want?  What else?  Money, happiness  power?  Power is good. Maybe I could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. I could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe I don't. I just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. Two kids. Maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it  live off interest. That sounds good. I could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. I like sleeping. But the time goes faster when I sleep. Do I want to go faster?  no?   yes?  maybe?  definitely maybe. I don't want to miss anything, but I want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. I'm too lazy to have to work for a living. I don't know how I'm going to get through it. All of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. But I only just started. preparing for my future. The future is a fantastic place. It can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if I know what I'm talking about. People die. kill eachother. Why? to what end?  Everyone dies. What difference does it make when?  I would prefer to die later in my life, though. I guess I want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. In the next millenium. Nostradamus says the world will end. soon. I want to see if it happens. That would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. Not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. Not as it is known, but in some form. A science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. As long as its well after I'm dead, I don't care who has it. The world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. Its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. Media tells us its not coming,  they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us there's no cliff, that were running towards an open pasture full of wildflowers and pretty white bunnies. But I know the cliff is there. Thats something else I want to se before I die, or as I die. Will the world survive?  will man kill the earth first, or will man kill man first?  One way, nothing survives. the other way, the earth survives, and possibly a few men, to carry on the race. I know who I'm rooting for. I want man to get to that cliff and go right off. Unless it can slow down, or run a different direction, but for now, the cliff. But that should be after I'm gone. I don't have to worry about anything. If only I could catch that damn leprechaun. 
__label__label1 Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, PROPNAME, and then my other best friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. Me and PROPNAME would go to ORGNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end. 
__label__label0 I keep thinking about the future and how my life will alter during and after college. I wonder how my grades will be after the first term. I hope I can make my parents proud. I don't want my parents to view me as a failure and a screw up I want them to be proud. I want to be accepted by everyone I meet. I want to succed in life. I wonder how my math test will be tomorrow. I just wish that society didn't view people on how much money they make I wish I could go to a place where everyone was the same and there was nothing to worry about maybe the place I'm thinking about is eternal utopia or heaven. I wonder if there is a heaven what happens after death where do we go. do we ever see the "creator" what is the creator is it god or did we evolve through evolution of mico o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
__label__label0 Every moment I am conscious of my physical self. it is like I have existed so long strictly within my mind that I have never really felt the sun touch my skin. I suppose I am excruciatingly aware of my body now that I realized I actually have one. Lately it feels like I am rediscovering the familiar. I have always walked down the street. but never been aware of things like others faces, the noise of traffic, the heat, the breeze, the color of the sky. I have always lived in this alternate universe. i see only enough of the physical world to avoid collisions. and I live in my head, in my thoughts, in my music and art. I almost never come out. But lately I have opened my physical eyes. Some of the things I have seen are things I could have done without. I'm not so sure I like it out here with the other people. I feel myself retreating again. I feel that small talk is a waste of breath. Any words outside my poetic code are words wasted. Any utterance that is not a song is a waste of voice. And I am trying to figure out why people NEED people. I have lived inside myself for a long time. I can make it through the monotony of every day life (hint: that's where the ACTING MINOR comes in). but maybe it would be more lucrative to just live down in here. And I wonder what is really "being productive". My mother said that I wasted my summer by being in love with someone who ended up not loving me in return. I feel that love is not a waste of time. If it is then what real purpose or function do we have in this bleak world. Of course, now with my heart blown away I feel a bit sad. But I meant it when I gave my love to this boy. I meant every word, every breath, every touch. And I guess that MY time wasn't wasted. his was. HIS time was wasted because he remained too long with someone he did not love. My time was not wasted. And now. let me push all memories of this love deep down into the corners of my soul. Right now this grain of sand irratating every pore in my body. but maybe a pearl will result. A song. A painting. Blah. Blah. Maybe I can once again transform the pain in my life into something pur-tee. Man, someday all of this shit that I have passed off and forgotten through my art and songs is going to resurface and say "Hey! We are still here. " and that is going to break me and FINALLY I will no longer have creativity to turn to because I won't trust it anymore. Gee. Something to look forward to. And this girl came up to me today on the first day of classes. She said I looked "alone" and invited me to her church where "everyone is a family and god is clearly present". Funny that she noticed I was alone and I didn't. I wanted to tell her that I would never fit into her christian bubble world. oh yeah, I live in a bubble world myself all right. but its a different kind altogether. Maybe I should invite her for a visit in MY bubble world. But. heh. i meakly gave her my number. i was in a way touched by her gesture and even though I oppose religion. who knows? I may go just to laugh at the SHEEP and. well. mEDITATE. And plus. it would probably light up this nice girl's life. Aww. It would also be cool to go someplace and have everyone be really happy to see you. I wonder if it would be wrong for me to go in order to reap these benefits. especially since there is NO CHANCE in my conforming to a religion. Hmm. It seems like I have been given the opportunity to explore some areas of my life that I have suppressed in the past. Certain tendencies. I guess I am really scared when it comes to this. I am afraid maybe of what I might find out if I try it. I mean. i have finally admitted to myself that these thoughts are frequent and substancial. But I don't want the course of my life to change that drastically. Right now I long for both but am happy with one. If I try the other and realize that it is so much better than the other and begin wanting only IT then I will have to do some major changes in my life and identity. But it might NOT be good. Or I might continue liking both equally. Which could also cause problems. Sheesh. 
__label__label1 College is awesome. There are so many good-looking girls. The atmosphere is free and open. I wish we didn't have class so I could go out and party every night. Partying has been fun. I get drunk, but I know my limit. I go where ever the party. Free beer is always good. I don't understand why the Asians frats have a cover charge to get in. There is not a lot of alcohol, and the parties suck. Although I'm Asian, I can't stand them. Asian guys dress weirdly, and the girls look funny. I associate myself with the whites. I grew up in a white neighborhood. I didn't have a white friend until I moved to LOCNAME which was 0 years. I only have a handful of Asian friends. Whites are a lot more fun to hang out with. They're more open and do whatever. I prefer my girlfriend to be white. In the past, I had 0 white girlfriends and 0 Asian girlfriend. Right now, I would like a white one, but I'm going after an Asian one. She is not like the others. She doesn't really like Asians either. She is half Japanese and half Vietnamese. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. She also happens to be in the same pyschology class. She sits next to me most of the times. I always sit next to my best friend, PROPNAME. He is cool. He knows when to party. I have a lot of friends in there, and most of them are from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. There so many PROPNAME students in there and at LOCNAME. That reminds me, the girl who sat next to me today would not quit laughing. At first, I thought she was cool. Things changed as the lecture progressed. The girl who sat in the row behind me, 0 seats to the right wearing the red PROPNAME shirt was good looking. I wish I was white so I could approach white girls with better ease. Man oh man. There so many pretty girls in that class. Microeconomics has a lot too. Especially the one two rows down from me. I normally sleep in that class, but she kept me awake. Damn. I wish I approached her. PROPNAME is an excellent place to eat. A lot of girls eat there. My parents are bringing up my bike on Saturday, and I'm excited. I definitely need a bike. They'll probably take me shopping and out to lunch. I probably take my roommate and woman along. My roommmate is pretty cool. Could be an asshole at times, but who isn't?  We went to school together. We have three classes together including pysch. Right now, I'm pissed at PROPNAME. He is one of my friends and is also in the pysch class. He won't shut up. He is starting to get annoying. He says a lot of stupid things. He doesn't like ORGNAME or something. When he is wrong, he will try to do some bullshit that makes him look right. Such an idiot. My Eco teacher is so stupid. Such an FOB. I just sleep in it now. Computer Science is so hard. I might drop it. That's it for now.

Sailor Soldiers theme plays. i hope I'll still have time around here to write my fanfics and my original piece. writing may be just a hobby, or so PROPNAME says, but I'm devoted to  it just the same, and I will keep writing, no matter what; like TV, it helps keep me sane in what seems like an insane world. all these kids and what-used-to-be-kids-a-few-weeks-ago, drinking, screwing around, partying their butts off, struggling through classes, spending all their free time studying; God!!! How can humans live like this?!!? I must write, I must watch television, I must keep my imagination going - I must keep creating my own worlds and immersing myself in them as much as possible while still functioning normally in the outside world. why write fiction, someone once asked? Someone quite succinctly answered, "Because reality bites!" I want to be like these people, and yet I do not; but then again, that's the way it is with me, always, isn't it? Human, yet inhuman, helper of men and destroyer of nations, this and that. i am always the great exception, one way or another. Mortal and immortal, good and evil, all abstract opposites do I embrace, and yet none can claim me fully. scientist, warrior, bard, clumsy, ugly oaf. i am what I am. What am I? I am PROPNAME. i have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME, I have been PROPNAME. a million assumed names over what feels like 00 lifetimes (but it's not; I know very well I'm just as mortal and human as the next guy - it's just that sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I guess you have these kind of odd thoughts when you have a world-generating imagination like mine. when you have pride like mine. arrogance like mine. insane and freaky judgment like mine. "I am a god! I am a god!! Damn you all who say it is not so!!!" goes a line from a book I've read. my roommate is on the phone again. talking with all of his friends who always call here, while  no one really ever calls me except for Mom, who just calls to nag. not that I mind the solitude, it's just that taking messages and answering phones for someone else and not getting paid $00. 00 an hour for it can get really annoying really fast. He's talking about a friend who lives in a private dorm - I wish I lived in a private dorm. I don't think I'll ever be really happy unless I can have my own house - not a big house, mind you, just one about the size of the one I grew up in. Just my own little castle in suburbia with my own bathroom, my own bedroom, my own closet, my own kitchen, my own TV, my own stereo; a place where I don't have to share and I don't have to worry about what anyone else wants - hell, I want a place where I can go (and stay) and have no problems. No worrying about where my paycheck and financial aid are, where the closest bank is around here, what time I have to be at class, what assignments I have to do. I want to be able to sit around all day and do nothing if I so choose, and have no ill consequences come out of it whatsoever. Yeah, that's a world I'd love - a world with no problems and no ill consequences from anything done. Hmph, how funny - I've just described Sailor Moon's Crystal LOCNAME of the 00th century. I want utopia. not a bad wish, when you really think about it, except that when I wished for it, I just wanted it for myself. I've noticed myself become more selfish and arrogant this past year- I wonder how that came out? Ah, well, forget about how - research that when you're in med school or have to write your next psych paper. For now, just condition yourself (whatever name you choose to use this time around) to be a good person, do your best, and keep writing about worlds where the good guys always win, problems can always be solved, and no matter how tragic things get, you can always have a happy ending. "Oh, what a beautiful dream; if it could only come true, you know, you knowith  what we need is a great big melting pot* Okay, strike that; hate that song. Okay, it's been 00 minutes, so let's send this in and hope the Prof. doesn't think you're too crazy. In case you have doubts, Dr. PROPNAME, I'm not; at least, not to the untrained eye. okay, shut up- you're not helping your image. Just wrap this up, okay? WRAP THIS UP! All right, go!  
__label__label0 ok, right now I feel tired and annoyed. maybe because I just broke up with my boyfriend of 00 months but maybe its because I couldnt get this website to work forever or the fact that I went to bed at two for no reason. putting the tired aside, I'm also pretty exited. my brother is teaching me how to solve a rubiks cube. I love doing things like that, but sometimes I give up too easily. not now though, I can't. not about the rubiks cube, but about the business school that everyone I talk to feels the need to tell me how difficult it is to get in,  but I'm not giving up. I'm trying to adjust to austin and its really not that hard, I just don't want to call it my home because its not- I've lived in houston my entire life. that's my home. even though I was raised in houston, ill end up in colorado. I feel like I'm trying to make conversation to a comuter which doesn't really work so ill just tell you about me. I love the color blue-any shade of blue, I love them all. I love cold weather even though I don't know what its like to be in a snow storm or shovel snow to get out of the driveway. I want a big truck when I'm old-not to show off but to be comfortable. I want to work, not be a housewife even though I do want kids maybe two or three. I admire my mom. she struggles and I love her. I was raised mormon even though I am not mormon anymore. I love dave matthews and sarah maclaclan  thier perceptions of life are awesome  I love songs that hit me right in the heart whether its an uplifting song or not. I love writing even though it takes me forever to write something worth reading. I like kissing. only when its sweet and meaningful for him and me. I love being a friend. helping those that I care about-it just makes me tingle inside. even though I wasnt always like that. I used to have the best scream. I was a selfish kid. I threw fits. I'm better, now I like to share. I didnot smile until I was two. sometimes I worry I have a bad heart because I can randomly have my heart go wild (literaly)  I wonder sometimes too if I got my moms manic depression. I'm not a sad person overall but I can be a lot. I always wondered how that worked too. maybe this course will help me understand. I like beer, but not too much. I used to drink to get my mind of things, now I realize that was dumb. now I write to get it off my chest. what do I think about?  god. the world. people. why?  I don't stand up to my dad even though my front pretends I do. I really just avoid him. his wife is evil, but her kids are the best. how do things like that work out? I have four brothers and a sister. I love them all. they are all so interesting and so individualistic. I have an ex boyfriend named ben that I am obsessed with and so does my roomate, mary. we both wore the same prom dress and bought the same bedding even though we did not shop together. I want her dad to mary my mom  hes neat. he writes for the houston chronicle and my mom is an english teacher. even though it wasnt her choice. she had to start working to be financially stable to avoid my dad. that s why I'm determined to make it in the business school and not be a housewife and drive a big truck. 
__label__label1 Computers, I hate them. Today has been a very fustrating day. Hours spent on waiting on people. Hours that I have wasted. I am nerous about not what is coming soon. I have so much work to do. I still don't have my Organic Book for organic. Gosh, I am so behind and the first exam is coming up really soon and I still haven't study for it. Worries, how come people have to have all different kind of worries. Isn't that dumb. I need to start studying soon. I guess I just work sleep tonight. Stay up for a while studying. I also got to understand PROPNAME. I am also behind in mirco. School. ahhh. Oh well, school is ok, but I really miss my friends in ORGNAME. They call and write but I really miss them. Everytime I talk to them I feel like flying back to ORGNAME. hehe Larmie just said something funny. I am hungry. I didn't eat dinner coz I was on the phone waiting for the people on the computer to help me. I have this . I forgot. Anyway. I really miss everything in ORGNAME. My friends and that fall is coming. My friend just wrote me and told me about how fall is coming. That makes me very jealous coz fall is my favorite season and I won't be able to enjoy it. I am stuck here in LOCNAME, hot hot hot. Gosh, I really miss ORGNAME. ORGNAME, PROPNAME, everyone one else. I am getting annoy. I am using a friends comp coz my doesn't work now. anyway her boyfriend is online and wants to talk to her but I am using it doing this assignment but he keep on making these noise. My friend is on the phone talking to a friend from back home. I . can't wait until thanksgiving or xmas. PROPNAME then my friends from ORGNAME is coming to visit me and I am planni to visit them on xmas. One thing I like aobut UT, I guess, is that we have 0 weeks off. That is good. But if I go to work, I probably won't be able to go to IN. I want to eat, I guess, I will after I finish with  this assignment. her boyfriend is making knocking noises now. I really want to tell him that I am doing an assignment now but then he will keep on asking and then I will waste my time, but he is really getting on my nerves. I don't want to be rude to him, since I am using my friends comp and he is her boyfriend. I still thinking about ORGNAME. How I miss that stupid place. I use to complain how I don't like it that much. But now, I trhink in many ways it is better than UT. I guess it is because I am not use to this place and that I haven't met that many friends yet. I don't think I will met that many friends now. PROPNAME the people in my classes are either junior or senior. Some sophomore but not much. They all have there own group already and I guess they are not really interested in meeting anymore people. I just reply to her boyfriend and I don't know what I was going to say. Oh, well, Oh, people here I guess they are not in the stage where they want to make that many new friends. I understand coz if I were them I guess I won't either. If I was in ORGNAME, I probably won't make any new friends coz I already have my own. They know me and right now,here I still don't care much coz I still have friends back home. Not really home coz home is now in LOCNAME. I wish I was back there sometimes but I also glad I am here, maybe I get to learn to be more independent. If I was in ORGNAME right now, I probably don't have to worry about the comp coz I will have plenty of friends helping me setup. I don't even have to do it myself. I think I might learn something from this. I hope I do, coz if not, I will be upset coz going though all this and still don't know hope to fix the mistake I will feel useless. I don't want to feel useless. wow I think I am really hungry coz my stomach is making a lot of noise. Maybe in a few more minutes I can go to eat. i have to eat noodles, I guess it isn't that bad. After that I think I will go do assignment 0 and then I will go study , can't study orgo, coz I don't have the book, maybe microbiology. I need to understand that. I hope I can find someone who can help me with  my problems. Just some friends like I have in LOCNAME, who cna help me when I need help. Some people who understand computers, some who can help me with  classes and some who can help bring me places. Hmmm I wonder if I will make those kind of friends. If so, I hope soon. Until then, I guess I will miss PUrdue a lot. well, got to go eat coz I am really hungry. I think , I hope this is long enough. 
__label__label0 Right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not I just submitted a blank page because I hit the tab button so I could write in paragraph form and then boom. the screen said you have submitted, thankyou. But anyways I hadn't even started. Right now I have no idea what I am supposed to be writing, the assignment seems to easy. Usually that means I'm doing something wrong. Right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write. I feel like I'm in a sort of mellow mood, after all, there's not much excitng going on right know. I have calculus to do and I almost don't want to pick up the book because I know I won't be able to do some, andthen I may get a bad grade on the homework. That means that I will get a bad grade in the class unless I do perfect on the tests. Well, I wish I knew how to type, not that this assignment would go by any faster. Sensations? Well I'm sitting on a chair, I can feel it supporting me. I have this habit of biting my lips, so I can feel that to. Only bite the inside of your lips because then they don't look all messed up all the time. If someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me. I wonder if the box keeps going, yes it does. Wait. agh. a drink of water. More sensations!!  I felt the water coldly flow down my neck where I imagine it's being mixed with luch. which was a 0 inch sub from "PO Boys?"  At least it was relatively healthy, but it's more expensive than ORGNAME's. Oh man I hope that somebody doesn't call because I might have to write this over again. Or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than 00 minutes and not done anything, that would be bad. Does that mean that I would have to go back and write this all over again. Well, I can't wait to get this done because I get to relax for one damn second of the day. I've been up since 0 walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back. It makes me hunch over because if I stand up straight then I would fall over. I hope I don't have a bad back when I'm older. at least I'll be smart. Wow I've already been writing for 00 minutes, probably about the wrong stuff, but hey. Another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard. And I can see the keyboard. My cell phone just rang, I could hear that. Well, anyways, this whole 00 minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about. I wonder what other people wrote, actually I could care less. Their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine, but anyways. I really hope this actually submits. after all, it is the last minute. I'm glad PROPNAME reminded me. 
__label__label0 As for now, I feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. I had many things to accomplish once I started school here at The university of LOCNAME and I am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as I achive the goals I need to. for instance, today, I needed to petition credit of hours which I earned off of the ap testing which I took in highschool. I attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though I typed the correct web site, I could not actually claim my hours. Thus I actually went to the Measures and Evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, I was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card I purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening I finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now I am a  much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, I began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. I remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times I feel that I can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything I need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends I know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. I do the same thing. I care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother,  he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. I miss him a lot. actually I probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed I would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could I not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. I really miss them. in addition, I miss my friends which go to different schools. I keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. I am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. I'm very close to my mom and that is why I believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and I hope that whatever I choose to do with my life I can impress her. however I would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that I will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that I can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that I can. 
__label__label0 OK, it's 0:00 and I hope I can get through this assignment without my computer crashing. I hate typing. chris is an asshole; this was a very bad day and I know it's probably bad to always be negative, but I don't fucking care because this is my stream and no one else's and I don't think anyone will read this anyway and if you do, you'll never know who I am because there are ten million people in that fucking class and no one knows who I am. by they way, would it be fucking possible to go to one of those classes and not be surrounded by sorority bitches? I mean, they are so annoying with their chatter about boys and hair and beer and parties, and they talk in class which is really annoying and they make my skin crawl. well I stopped for like 00 seconds, is that OK? are you going to come over here and kill me now? didn't think so. damn, I am displaying some fucked-up-ness am I not? I knew this was going to be a 000 intro class but I forgot that meant freshmen crawling around everywhere. I was never that stupid. I was never that annoying. well fuck, it's only 0:00; but anyway I have a ton of homework to do today and a friend is coming over  for dessert later, so I need to get this done. i will add some happy thoughts just so you don't apply your analytical theories and conclude that I am mad and need to be injected with some medicines to make me happier and more docile. happy. happy. happy. nothing comes to mind. except that donny's trial is finally over and that makes me happy. my brother, donny, was accused be a couple of girls of molestation during a clarinet lesson and that was nine months ago and my family had to pay thousands of dollars to defend the lucky guy and now we have no money, but at least those mini-whores backed down, yeah thanks, after 0 damn months they were like (my hand hurts) nevermind, we don't want to testify (because we're lieing!!!!) how do you spelll lieing? liing, lying yeah lying, sorry that I don't know how to spell but who cares becasue no one is going to read this anyway. I am a very fast typist so I think that my writing will be longer than most chris just walked by sophie the kitty is playing with the lizards and chris is trying to look at the screen but I think he shouldn't his is my fiance and my fhands hurt carpal tunnel carpal tunnel I have a huge secret: I have a giant crush on an old english teacher of mine; she is a woman; and I an engaged to marry a man. hahahahah. that's funny. I think that htat is very very funnyll meow. I made a cat toy for sophie; a film canaster full of pennies; she loves it; it is loud and my toes are cold; I had hot dogs for dinner; I can't tyep as fast a s my thought are coming; becasue I am thing like a milltion things at a time like tath I sjust spent 000 dollars on a princeton review and I hope that I t gives me a better ORGNAME score than ANYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD!! hahahahahha I don't care what you say; I am taking a break. ok now I am mutch better. muthc I said mutch; hahah I am better my hands don't' just I meant hurt anymore but my toes are still cold. anyway this english teacher is really cool and I've had her for like two semesters and she said I was "too naughty" in class. what is chris blowing on? he was blowing on "a tabby thing on his  book and he wanted the ink to dry. last night he farted and it smelled really bad. ihahahah the things going through my mind. I hiop chris says he wants to read this and that iwll probayy color my thoughts for the duration; could you do something aobut those fukcing standardized tests? I means really? I got a 0000 on my SAT and I hapve a 0. 00 ORGNAME; os that was not a very good predictor of my progress at 0:00 see  you. 
__label__label1 I've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. Tryint to plan everything out so I get to see everyone. I miss home. The people, the places. My church, my room, and all the little things too. Just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. So peaceful. So safe. One things I've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. It won't ever be tha same. The relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Ms. PROPNAME, my parents. You can't replace that. It's always there, just sitting, empty. Sure, I can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. They're all differnt and unique. My left arm is tired. Well, I just thought that so I figured I'd write it. And I just thought about writing about my arm. Wow!  And I JUST thought about thinking about writing about my arm. It never ends. weird. I've always been interested in how the human minds works. It's funny when you think about it. Here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work!  Isn't that weird?  When you think about it, where do you get yourself?  How can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with?  It's impossible. An endless cirlce of thought and ideas. The human mind is a mystery, and always will be. That kind of impresses me that I came with that. Gee, I'm smart. Just kidding. Well. ten more minutes. Ok, I ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. My shoulder hurts. Wow, I complain a lot. I'm feeling my elbow right now. It's swollen or something. I'm not sure why. I've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. Who knows?  It doesn't hurt, but I don't know if I should avoid straining it or what. I'm supposed to work out today. We'll see. I've been thinking about someone back home a lot. Her name is PROPNAME and we met about a month before I left for college. There was this kind of initial attraction I guess you'd say. Kind of weird. I haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. I think it was her bright personality. She has thing kind of glow about her. She's always laughing. I like that in people, because I need to laugh more sometime. So we kind of talked about our relationship some, and I told her I didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, I mean, since I was leaving for college. She's a junior in high school. But we've kept in touch a lot. I think she wants a committment, but I don't think that's smart. But you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. Sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. It's like faith. God doesn't always make sense to me. I hear all the time people trying to disprove God, or Christ, or the Bible, or christianity. like I'm taking this class, the Rise of Christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the Bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. But the fact is this:  I know what PROPNAME has done in my life, and nothing can change that. EVER!  What He did WAS illogical, it WAS beyond understanding, it WAS a miracle!  And NOTHING can disprove that, not science, not anything. How do people react to that then?  Well, people's final defense is usually, "Well, then you must be crazy. "  And if that's all they have, then I'll take that any day. Times up. Hey, I liked this assignment. I think I will enjoy this class. 
__label__label0 I have a headache I took some excederine a few minutes ago I am tired. After four days off I was out of the habit of going to school. I feels good to be home. This assignment is odd. I am full. My head is hurting again with a dull pain this time. Tuesday night, nothing good comes on Tv  I have to watch satellite shows. Some people did this assignment in the first day of class. I guess it is hard to find anything to do when you move away from home  I am glad I decided to live at home, but I am afraid I am missing out on meeting new friends. Sometines I feel like an outsider on campus. But I wouldn't have made friends easily either. I would just sit around, study and be bored. I wish I was more outgoing. I want to speak to people and make new friends but it is one of the hardest things to do speaking to strangers. I want to but my own inhibition stops me. It is funny how you can want very badly to do something but someting inside you stops you from doing it  This is really helping my typing. Like in high school typing class  High school was generally a good time  I had trouble meeting people there also. I was time to graduate, more would have been ridiculus. I waited until people would make an effort to meet me rather than be proactive  I should approach people myself like I intended to do today but couldnt  LOCNAME is a big place  I have a lot of concerns  I like chemistry and welch hall but I am a business major  Business majors earn more money  I want to buy a house and a new car on my own break away rom my parents  but I am not ready to leave home. starting high school depressed me  I am afraid I will hate business  I think God's plan was for me to be a scientist but I am taking all the wrong courses  Common sense tellw me to major in business but my gut feeling is science  there are no easy answers  I can be a judge, which is cool  I don't think I think fast enough on my feet to be a lawyer  Drafting documents I can do  A masters in business would provide as many opportunities a law school But with law I get a license and a Doctors degree. Is prestige that important. Sometimes lawyers carry a stigma  I don't want to seem overeducated to work in business, but its now or never. It is too hard to decide what to do in life  I am afraid I am making all the wrong decisions. time is up I like this assigment 
__label__label1 I am sitting in front of my computer right now thinking about how I have so many things to do and I am not sure how to organize my time sufficiently. I cannot decide what my priorities are yet. Of course classes are the most important part of being at college, but there are various clubs and organizations that I am interested in from the description on flyers and posters. I don't know what these clubs are really like though. It is the people that makes an organization fun and you cannot tell what people are like from a flyer. I am really hungry right now. I hate that the dining hall is closed for dinner on Sundays, not that the food is really that good anyway. Wait this isn't Sunday, this is Monday. We just didn't have class because it is Labor Day. That will mix me up all week. I will be a day behind. It is hard to let your thoughts flow naturally when you are thinking about thinking. I am so glad that PROPNAME came up to visit me this weekend. It feels so good to laugh with someone that already knows you. You don't have to try or think, everything just flows so naturally. I know that it takes time to develop a friendship like this and I cannot expect to just make instant connnections like that in a new place, but I am not good with all that patience and effort. I can't wait until the pizza gets here. I don't feel bad about eating unhealthy food because I have to walk so much around campus. I don't think I've ever walked so much in my entire life. And the heat totally drains me by the end of the day. I am dead tired. I am really surprised by the comfort of the beds in my dorm room. At orientation I couldn't sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable but now the beds don't seem as bad. Except the window next to my bed shines light all night long. I am used to total darkness and total silence from home. The car noises and people at all hours makes it tough to fall asleep. I've also been having strange dreams lately. The first couple of weeks in a new place I always have really vivid dreams and I always remember them really clearly unlike usually. This happens everytime I am away from home. Wether it was when we moved to LOCNAME or just going to summer camp. I am looking at the picture of my dog sitting on my computer. I miss petting PROPNAME. The other day there was a towel laying on the floor of our dorm room and I had to do a double take because I thought it was PROPNAME laying there. She is too adorable. When I get my own place I am going to get a LOCNAME puppy. I don't think I could ever live totally by myself, without a pet or anything. I either need a roommate or an animal, something to acknowledge my existence with a tangible response. Now its been a little over twenty minutes and the pizza is here and it smells really good. 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling very annoyed. I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a ORGNAME gift form the Co Op I can't believe that PROPNAME is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 0 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the "jerk" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the ORGNAME ORGNAME and then found out that he was going to LOCNAME I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 0 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 00 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 0-0 times a week and running 0-0 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like PROPNAME PROPNAME. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   
__label__label1 College is so cool. This is a pretty cool campus. Surprisingly I'm really not that scared or homesick, and I'm 0000 miles away from home. I grew up in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. , but I moved to LOCNAME when I was 00 and then to LOCNAME when I was 00. Now I'm back in good ol' LOCNAME to stay. I have quite a few friends here so it's not like I'm alone. In fact, I saw my old elementary "girlfriend" the other day down on the drag. I was walking to get my books and she was in a 00 black ford mustang driving the other way. She honked the horn and waved and as I looked back to wave at her, I tripped on a pole and nearly fell flat on my face. I don't know if she saw it. i hope not. I called her up tonight to talk to her, but she wasn't home so I left a message. I said, "it was cool seeing you the other day, but I don't know if you saw me almost fall flat on my face, it was embarrasing. I can't go out looking like that so give me a call so I can reedem myself. "  I can't believe that the jester tv channel shows cool movies. My roomate is watching the movie Fallen right now with this girl. He says its really scary, but I just think it's weird. It's funny, I never really get scared that much by movies and stuff. I think I just tell myself that it's not real and then it doesn't bother me. That must be like psychology or something. Damn, I think about the opposite sex way too much. I love girls, I think that they are the most beautiful creatures to ever walk the face of the earth. I certainly picked the right campus for girls though. Like 00% of them are goddesses compared to the ones where I come from. Where I live now, most of the girls are big farm girls that could take me in a fair fight, and they are all polish. Polish people are so stupid . . they'd couldn't make ice because they forgot the receipe. Well, my twenty minutes are up, so this is me signing off 
__label__label1 right now it is 0:00 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over. 
__label__label1 Sometimes I think of what other people are thinking. I watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. They must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. I don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. I feel strange in the fact that I am putting my thoughts into words. Though I am concentrating on writing, I am also able to let my mind wander while I write. The way I think and the way I process my thoughts has changed since I've been in college. Leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which I desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that I have at home. My life in LOCNAME is good, but it is missing all those people that I made such a major part of my life. I wonder if those people will ever be there again. My family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. My friends and my boyfriend are the ones that I spent ever spare moment with. Now that I am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. I always travel back in time, in my head, to the days I spent with them. Every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times I had with them. Maybe they are thinking the same way. I can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. Those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. My mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but I have yet to see what she is talking about. My mother is great. Now I realize all the things she has done for me. She was always there for me, and even now that I am hundreds of miles away, she still there. I was distracted by the distant voices behind me. They seem to be discussing a project. Some kind of stress has been put on this group. I am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. Stress is one thing that I cannot deal with. When I stress I start to think a lot. When I think, I get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that I no longer can do the things I used to do in the past. Some people beside me are also using the computer. Their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that I am writing about them. If I were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. I can always feel someone looking at me. Even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes I can see someone look. Even when I don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. After this writing assignment is finished, I have to drive through LOCNAME's traffic to get home. That is the only thing I can't stand about going home. What should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. Things like that frustrate me. The light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. I have a feeling that LOCNAME is going to be just like LOCNAME, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. It is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. Pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. After that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again. 
__label__label0 well I guess I begin. anyway, I don't really have a clue as to what I'm thinking or feeling at the moment actually. I'm hoping that the psychology computer gets this even though I'm not saving it in word processor but whatever. I had a good day today well I guess. I went to mason's funeral. things just. well. I can't really place how I feel about that. well I'm upset, but can't place exactly why. but I don't feel like talking about this. I'm interested in the weirdness and indecisiveness of my mind. my husband just walked over here to check out what I'm writing. he only had to read the first few sentences to figure out exactly or should I say how inexactly my mind works. now, why does it work like that? your guess is as good as mine. but whatever. I wish I had a game of some sort. maybe just a pet to play with. I love my husband very very much anyway my friend reggie used to write sort of like this in a metaphorical way. anyway. I feel like I'm throwing off the experiment by writing stupid shit. perhaps in another place another time will unfold to a utopia that sings the praise of wrath in a time where pain is nonexistent but perhaps that makes no sense. but anyway I guess I'll keep on typing what pops into this head of mine or theirs or his or hers. from laura's box or my box. I hope lisa gets my time card I'm pretty sure I turned it in but I can never really be sure of anything. now can I? so I'll continue about the unicorns of relentlessness and the dwarfs of forgetfulness while I sing. la. la. la. but to be exact well my mind seems to be shutting down. I don't have thoughts all the time like most people. the only person I've met who doesn't either is my mom wait but maybe I have thoughts that are just on hold or don't ever quite make it to where my interpreters can interpret my interpretations of the world around me. but anyway I believe in god I believe in nothing also. but how can that be. it's a "metaphysical can of worms" that we've just opened up now isn't it no I'm not. it hasn't been twenty minutes yet yep that's right. sorry to burst your bubble but that's what I want to do anyway I happen to be learning quite a bit about myself at this point. in fact this is rather therapeutic. what would he write if he had to write for twenty minutes I think that these should be anonymously posted so that I can feel better knowing that someone is just as nutty as I am. or even that I'm not ridiculous. anyway I doesn't. blah blah so  
__label__label1 Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like ORGNAME so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in LOCNAME for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to LOCNAME, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase "Is it hot enough for ya?" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 0 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 00's up! Hope it was good reading!  
__label__label1 I can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course I let him in anyway. What is this control he has over me? I can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. All I see are blue eyes and red hair. Deep, deep blueness. There I get lost into submission. Is it me? Is it all just something I do to myself? Where are the lines I should be drawing. Why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? I wonder if he's sleeping right now? I know he's home. Maybe I should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? His room is so close just right down stairs. I know he look up at me every night through his window. He's sees everybody I let in. I'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? It will be an interesting year. I wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. Although, it's hard sometimes. Especially with the angel downstairs. Ha! no pun intended. I just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. We're so different. I'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. Maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. I think that might be part of it. I read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! He asked me when I met him if I thought we'd be dangerous together and I said, "I'm not dangerous with anybody," but I'm begging to change my mind. I wish I could see inside him. Usually I can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. I guess I'll just start looking harder. If I go down there right now I know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. I'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. Why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. Then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. Who casts the spells on us? Who laughs at our bumbling confusion? Is it all a matter of having the ideal children? Are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? If so, how does my body know? Do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs? 
__label__label1 I guess I have no started my 00 minutes of writing for the psychology class. As I'm writing I keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when I'm supposed to finish typing. I think about what I was thinking in class when you talked to us about this HW and how I wanted to talk about certain things while I was doing. But actually I start thinking about what happened tonight. We all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. I wish my roommate would listen to better music. After capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. We put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. Afterwards our President asked us to make this a dry event. I support him 000% because one I don't drink, two I don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three I think that all the points that he made were very strong. My roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. I think that they are wrong anyhow because as President I think that PROPNAME did the right thing in telling us not to drink and I don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. It was an executive decision. I'm debating whether I should go outside to the pool with everyone else when I'm done with that. I was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but I will see her on Monday so I'm still happy. This weekend I have lots of things to do. I'm running through my schedule for the weekend. Tomorrow I have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. I keep on thinking about what else I'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. I have never really sat down and typed everything I'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that I type just like I think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. My leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. But after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. We'll see if we actually will keep it but I think we will. I'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. I think about everything else I could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing I really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. I am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though I would still have liked to see my friend tonight. I kind of like this girl but I'm not sure. She's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where I can say that I like her but I do think that she's kind of interested. I also think about my friend who is coming up from LOCNAME next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. We have been friends for a long time and we get along great. But the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so I'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. I know that it can't be too much because I have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time I don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. If anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. We will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. I have the full intention of not having sex. I never have and never will until the day I get married. I have thought about being a priest for a long time so I'm just waiting for God to give me my call and I will follow His will. I really hope that he hurries up though cause I don't have a lot of patience. I think that I have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. I can be patient for certain things but I just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. I know that God doesn't count in that but I try to hurry Him up. One of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make God laugh all you had to do was to tell Him your plans. I'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. I guess that it all depends on whether you are Christian or Catholic or simply don't believe in God or have another religion. I realize that there are a lot of people here at LOCNAME that simply doesn't believe in God and I think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. I keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. I wish that everyone would be able to believe in God and receive the Eucharist everyday. It is the most amazing gift that God gave us. It's sad how some people just ignore God or sometimeseven laugh in His face. This was what I originally wanted to talk about when I was thinking about what I was going to write in this paper. I thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that I can write on but then I realized that I couldn't do that because it would have been planned. So I decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. For the most part I think that it worked because as I think back of all the things that I have written for the past 00 minutes I have gone through various different topics. Ranging from drinking, to girls, to God. I think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. I realize that the time is up and that I no longer need to be writing but I'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. I notice that I almost finished a complete page of writing. 
__label__label0 I hate driving in LOCNAME. There is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. People are so impolite when it comes to cars. PROPNAME just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. And now I have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. My mom didn't want me to take it with me. I hope the body shop does a good job. That is my main concern. I had a headache this morning. I think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. My roommate was being nice to me this morning. PROPNAME told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. And boys are so much trouble. Why does PROPNAME always have to do this to me? I think I will finally answer his question truthfully now. I thought I had been, but he was right, I'm still hiding something. I don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what I want. And then he says not to want anything. Why must he always try to be the good guy? I don't know if he is telling me the truth. If he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? This boy is driving me nuts. I don't understand why he keeps doing this. Deep down, I think I know the answer. But I guess I hide from things a lot. People always say I hide myself. PROPNAME says I hide myself in questions. I do. I never answer personal questions. I answer them with questions. I don't know why. Maybe I do need a psychiatrist. I think too much. I think I scare PROPNAME. Because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. I don't like her. She doesn't like me either. I've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. She looks at me funny. I think she's stringing him along. That's why he does this to me. But then he told me I was wrong. He said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. I think it scares him to let himself go. For some reason I think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. He saw through me hiding behind questions. But I think it's because I don't doubt him. I trust his opinions and his thoughts. That's something I don't do with most people. I trust him. Which surprised me. It usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. Maybe because I am always hiding. For some reason I think he has the key to unlock whatever it is I am hiding. And I think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that I can't open myself. That's what I want, I guess. I want to tell him the truth but I can't. Because like him. I am hiding. We're both hiding. Only he does a better job at it. Probably because he is a guy. Why do I trust him? I don't understand that. But sometimes I think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. Why do I trust him so much? I think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. I remember when I first met him; I was not attracted to him. He looked cunning to me. Like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. But then I think he also has the heart not to. That's why I think I started to like him. He has a good heart. And I think that's one quality that is hard to find. Oh my gosh! I guess this answers his question of what I think about him. I think I will give him a copy of this one day? I will tell him the truth. The entire truth of what I thought when I first met him until now. But I also want him to tell me too. Because I don't want to be the only one who opens up. But I don't think that will ever happen. I think my twenty minutes is about to be up. And I have such a bad memory; I don't remember anyone's name. I feel so bad. Why can't I remember? That's unfair to me because people know who I am but I have no idea who they are. I need to work on my memory. 
__label__label0 Right now I am feeling good because today is Friday. So far I have really enjoyed my first week of school. I like all my classes so far, and I am embracing the whole college experience. I am also happy because I am going home to LOCNAME today. It has only been a week since I left but I already miss my house and especially my parents. Right actually I do not have anything on my mind. I am pretty tired because I slept late last night and had a fairly early class. In fact, right now sleep would be really good. Well my stomach is also talking to me so I am also hungry. I have not eaten yet today. I am actually eating less in college since I seem to be always busy and always on the run. I like it though because maybe then I can lose some weight. Another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. I never was really into computers in high school and now in college I have to constantly use it. I wish I was better with computers because I really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. I think the reason why I do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. I cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what I really want. For example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason I could not get into the website. However, I am glad I am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. I think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that I am rambling and to be honest I do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. I am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. My brain is just telling me to think of something to write. Actually I am also anticipating for the time to be up. Twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. Speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. I am finally done. 
__label__label1 Hi I'm PROPNAME. I've been looking forward to this assignment since I heard of it. How often do I get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. I apologize. I can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. I'm listening to emenem right now. I don't want to give the reader the impression that I'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and I can type fast to it. man I pity whoever has to read this. Let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. I was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no I wasn't high). I mean think about it. I'd go into this more but I'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. I really like ORGNAME. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. I like LOCNAME. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in LOCNAME. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. I can't stand him. I brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that I'm using right now. I usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. I suppose I could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but I promised my roommates this would only take 00 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 0 minutes really flew by. I'm a Japanese major. Now if you were wondering " wow I wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? " you know. I feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am I thinking about now. I guess I'm thinking about the way I think, and I guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. I usually think in words. unless I'm inebriated then I think in pictures. I don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that I have a short attention span but I somehow pictured this differently. I thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now I've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. Whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. While I'm telling you what to do, you should vote for PROPNAME. Aww here's something I can write about: politics. I hate and fear PROPNAME PROPNAME. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of LOCNAME is quite the insult. his Christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. I rue the day the Christian right gain presidential power. I also am happy I worked "rue" into that last sentence. aww yeah. Well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. I also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. I'm glad I didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. I will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. I promise you I'm not crazy. Well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm not really sure what to write here, but here goes. So, I'm in a new state, in a new place, with no one here that I knew before I arrived. Sounds kind of scary, but I'm dealing. I came to texas from LOCNAME, TN. And it really seems that I am one of the few that are from out of state. Everyone is from LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME, or LOCNAME. And it has been rough, because most people came here with all of their best friends and here I am, this outsider who knows no one. But I was excited anyway, because I loved the school and all the school spirit. I came here early, because I was going to go through rush. Unfortunately about a month before I left for school, I was diagnosed with mono. I had been feeling okay, but started feeling bad right before I left for school. I had to skip the open house round of rush because I felt so bad. I participated in the rest and actually pledged the one that I wanted, but it was one of the hardest experiences. I had to be perky and cute when it was 000 degrees outside and when I felt horrible. I got through it and now I feel much better, but I will always remember that! Now that I am in the sororityI definitely like it but it is still hard. All the girls live in a different dorm than I do, and 00 out of 00 of them are all from the same high school in LOCNAME! It's crazy. They are all really nice, but it is hard to make friends with people who already have all of their best friends here. I, so far, like the older girls better than my pledge class. We have our retreat next weekend, so hopefully I will get to know them better after the retreat. Classes are going well, but I'm struggling with the huge ones, because they are bigger than my entire high school! I only graduated with 00 people, so it is very different here. It is hard to know everything that goes on on campus, because everyone else already knows what and where everything is and I have no idea! Anyway, all this sounds like I am not having fun and that is absolutely not true! I LOVE school, but it has been so hard to force myself to stay home to get rid of the mono when all I want to do is go out, meet new people, and have fun! I do miss home a lot. I have always been very close to my family, especially my little sister and my mom (and my little dog Missy) So I miss them all a whole lot, but I am dealing. I have made some great friends in my dorm and I like all my professors and the people in my classes. I am looking forward to going home for Thanksgiving to see all my friends, but I am also looking forward to a lot of fun before then. Okay, I think it has been about 00 minutes, so I am going to leave now. So long, professor, even though you aren't reading this! :) Bye 
__label__label0 Well another night of staying up late. I don't know why I don't really want to go to bed. I guess I just don't feel like it or I feel like I have to do something before I go to bed, but then something else pops up. I think I got used to not sleeping during my time in the ORGNAME. Kind of fun back then. The ORGNAME usually pops in my head late at night when I'm on the computer because that's what I did in the ORGNAME. I can tune everything out and just have the humming of the computer and only the light from the screen providing light for the room. Reminds me of sitting in the track at 0 or 0am shooting missions. I wonder where I would be if I would have stayed in. I bet I would have gone to LOCNAME for a year then back to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wish I would have gone to LOCNAME as soon as I got out of AIT. Those guys came back better trained than the guys who stayed in the LOCNAME. I probably could have used that year being away from everybody. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. Man I hate the rain. I remember in LOCNAME I missed all the rainy days at school. I guess I got lucky it only seemed to rain on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I miss LOCNAME. The leaves, the snow, the mountains and the lake right behind the apartment. Man, everyday there was football weather. I can't believe they lost to ORGNAME last week. Man I hate ORGNAME. 
__label__label0 I don't really want to go to my BA000 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call PROPNAME so we can go study at the ORGNAME or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 0000 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if PROPNAME has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at ORGNAME has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA000 I will go to eat at PROPNAME and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. PROPNAME should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for PROPNAME, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA000 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. 
__label__label0 Entering college is a whole new experience that is new to me. One that is unique in its own right. An experience that begins a new transition from the home to a life ORGNAME individuality and freedom. Being only three hours away from home, it didn't seem like I was breaking away on my own, but in actuality this is only the start of creating a new life for myself. After high school, everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves. One friend would move to LOCNAME LOCNAME and another would move to LOCNAME. The once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast. Although ORGNAME is a new change for me, it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on. From this day forward, I am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past I can put behind as memories. The challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature. Back in high school, I would hear stories of friends failing out of LOCNAME due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol. Everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own. I would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home. These stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that I would not be like the rest, but an individual. That's what ORGNAME is basically is, just a group of individuals all with the same goal, a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives. Its like its own community at LOCNAME. All students relatively the same age trying to create a future for themselves. I sometimes wonder if I have what it takes to succeed at ORGNAME. My mind is still in doubt seeing the enormous campus each day as I walk to class. But all I can ask for is for my best and that is good enough for me. Even though ORGNAME is a different city than my home town LOCNAME, I still feel like I haven't left LOCNAME in a way. With all my friends attending this ORGNAME it just seems like LOCNAME all over again which is one of the reasons I was considering going out of State. It seems great to have a large number of your friends close to you, but in a way I have a desire to start totally fresh. Throughout campus, I would see students from my school walking up and down the street and sometimes wish that a whole new atmosphere was around me so that I can begin a life that is not attached to my old one. The University of ORGNAME does however let you become any kind of person you desire with a new start even though it is kind of mixed in with the old. As for home, I sometimes wonder if my parents are doing well without me. With their constant calls and visits, it seems like they lost a part of themselves when they had to let go of me. So along with the stress that comes along with being a student at a ORGNAME, my stress also comes with the worry of how things are back home. Seeing my mom cry, tore my heart apart with the goodbye that completed my transition to ORGNAME. I notice how people don't show how lucky they are that they have an opportunity like going to ORGNAME but instead take it lightly as if its nothing when in fact thousands of dollars are being invested in you in hopes that you create a successful future for yourself. College is a whole new experience that allows you tremendous independence. It is my job that I spend my time wisely and take advantage of the situation in creating something out of myself. I see some of my friends just wasting their lives away on drugs and partying. I would like to do something for them, but their destiny is their own fate of what they and make out of it. All I can offer them is my support. Although fear did strike me before I entered UT, it now has turned into an excitement of a whole new world. 
__label__label0 Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. 
__label__label0 Sitting here in front of my large window, I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room. Everything feels fresh and clean, except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed. I love warmth any form of it actually. Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold. Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough? My old special boyfriend used to tell me, "cold hands, warm heart. " That was something his mother used to say. I guess she had cold hands too. Right now, I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices. I am no way questioning my faith in God, but instead, how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing. For instance, ever since going through rush and pledging, I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to. Basically, my biggest concern is partying and or drinking. For me personally, I feel that alcohol is something that I really don't need to have fun. Then, why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway? After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy, I have done much better. Going to the parties, I merely say, "No thanks, I'm fine" when offered the drink. I am so blessed to have the friendship of PROPNAME. It's funny how close or connected you can feel to somebody when you've only known them for a couple of months. Some of my friendships that have lasted for years are not nearly as close as the companionship that I am experiencing with PROPNAME right now. The only problem is that I feel myself really starting to like him. Actually, in reality, deep down I have what they call a "crush" for him ever since we met at the ORGNAME camp that we worked at together. I'm not sure what he thinks he is so incredibly complimentary to me, so I have the suspicion that he may reciprocate some of my feelings. All of our discussions circle around God and Jesus. I have never known anybody so passionate for their believes. Overall, it makes me feel like I should be moving in a different direction, a higher one with my relationship with Christ. This takes me back to the partying scene  What I see there is not glorifying God or His name. Yet, if I can, in some way, glorify His name while I am there, then my actions will coincide with my believes, right? In a way, the only thing I can count on is prayer and patience. It makes me think of PROPNAME and his life in LOCNAME. By faith and trust in God, PROPNAME and his people passed through the Red Sea. I have faith in my Lord that He will provide me with direction and strength, like he promised to Moses in the Bible. This leads me to think about my education. Sometimes I wonder what my future will be like  What am I going to major in? How many years of college will I attend? Will I have a good job? Will I be married? Will I have children?  the questions are endless and sometimes it can even be entertaining to imagine how things will be. I've noticed that when I think about things like this, I always see the fairy tale side of the story. I see myself with a wonderful education, a highpaying and fun job, an incredible husband, and three cute and perfect kids. This fairytale imagination of mine can lead to bad things or to a lost in the grasp of reality. I remember going into high school coming from a small, private middle school and thinking that I would be playing varsity everything, would have tons of new friends, and I even thought that I would be dating a cuter, older guy. Well, this was not the case. Things happened very differently. I ended up, by the end of my high school career having all of these things, but in a different way. I had six very close girl friends (not tons), I had a special guy in my life (actually a month younger than myself), and I made varsity softball (after two years of working really hard). Yet, looking back, I am so incredibly pleased as to how my life has traveled so far. So, looking ahead, I really must understand that as much as I want to pave the way for myself, that sometimes things happen differently than planned. Yet, there is a reason and there is a plan. Even when negative things occur, there is some kind of positive outcome, whether it's realized the next day or ten years down the road. Bad things are going to happen  it's inevitable, but it's essential to try to look at things in a different light, a 
__label__label0 Ok well this seems like an informal assignment, so I'm going to treat it that way. And presently I have a bone to pick with women. I'm going to let you know about a little situation I have undergone recently, and see if I can figure out why women are so weird. Ok so first off, I had this girl, we'll call her PROPNAME, that I have been in love with since 0th grade but never got a chance to pursue. As a background on her, she is a player; meaning that she likes to lead guys on, then break their hearts. But she still had me swooning over her for some reason. She has been my best friend for almost 0 years and so I this summer I decided to give it a shot and ask her out, after all I had nothing to lose. So I asked her out, and she said no because: "the timing is wrong, college is coming up and I don't want to start anything because I like you so much that I think it would actually be a relationship and not just a game for me". So this gets me mad and so I just decided to play along with her and hope she would eventually give in to let me have just 0 date with her. Throughout the summer I continued to pursue her with minimal success. She then left off to school and I never got my chance. Then 0 weeks ago she came and stayed with me and we ended up making out all night long for no apparent reason at all. It was very out of the ordinary, but I wasn't going to complain because I liked her so much. So she started acting really weird after that day, and just ignored me. When I confronted her last night, she told me " I just don't know what to think, I just thought of you as my best friend, and then that all happened and I don't know why and I enjoyed it but I feel strange now. " So of course she is just saying this because she wants to maintain control over my feelings and keep me here in case she can't get a date in school up where she goes. I don't like this idea though, so I conjured up a plan that would stop this. She just loves to play mind games so I started playing mind games back, by leading her on and then just not talking and some various other tactics. Eventually I won and she stopped being weird, but last night when I confessed that I was doing the mind game thing to get back at her, she went haywire and got all mad because "I took control of her feelings with no care whatsoever". So my dilemma and all I can think about now is why women are so weird. Not only is she a strange girl, but my ex girlfriend is also adding to my confusion. She is also attending ORGNAME and we broke up before we came here, and now she is mad because I am moving on with my life and not just out chasing her around like I used to. This makes her mad so she spends all her time trying to make me mad in various ways that don't work and it is just weird, I do not understand it at all. My friend's dad told me he would write me a check for 0 million dollars if I could figure out women, and with my recent situation, it seems like it is never going to happen. Aside from all this chaos going through my mind while I'm conscious, I have dreams about these two girls in my sleep, and they don't make sense either. So alas I am just sitting here confused pondering why women are so difficult and why they think they have such control over guys' feelings. I don't think I will ever understand but I can't stop thinking about it. And since we were only supposed to type for 00 minutes, and being the slow typist I am finished now, so that's all that is on my mind. I must say though, this assignment could be good because I feel better just venting like this. 
__label__label0 I wonder if anything is going to come to mind as I am supposed to do this assignment. It is really hard for me to do something when I am put on the spot, such as this assignment asks me to do. What can I possibly write about the 00 minutes I have that will be enough to satisfy the professor. I wonder why there are Braille letters on drivethrough ATM machines. It was a coincidence that I mentioned that to my friend and then in Family Relationships the professor mentioned it. What do I have to do today? I have a crapload of Math that I have been putting off that is due Wednesday. I still have half of it to finish and I swear to myself that I will finish it today, but I know that I will keep on putting it off until I have to stay up most of the night to finish it the day before. I never stay up to late though, unless it is a project that I am really into and I will spend the little time that I have to really do my best on it. On other stuff like Math or something I am less passionate about I won't care what grade I will get, I won't stay up past 0:00am on a project I am not interested in. Ah, a procrastinators life. But well, I am not sure if it will work for me in college. In high school I did just fine, but I am not sure about college. I guess I will have to wait until my first tests to decide if I should change my ways, but looking at it realistically, I probably will not. I always tell myself to do this or change that, and I do for that week but I always know I will go back to being the same thing I try so many countless time to change. I really want to be like my roommate. She studies all the time, but like my friend PROPNAME said yesterday, she is one of those people who really has to try hard to get good grades. She doesn't think I am one of those people, She isn't. But honestly I would not want a doctor that never cracked a book open until the day before a test and made all As to be my doctor. If she ever decides that is what she wants to be. She is always changing her major, but she is going to med school, at least that is what she says. I don't know what I want to be. I am confused. I tell her I want to be a vet, and then she reminds me of the day I almost vomited when ORGNAME, my dog, took a crap in my room. If I can't stand dog crap, how am I going to be a vet. I just realized that I have to pee, but I still have 0 more minutes to write and then check my spelling, I think I am just going to submit it like this, he said so himself that it will be graded if I have done the assignment, not my spelling. I just realized that I have changed the subject. I always to that. Somebody could be talking about homework and I will bust out saying "Look a my new sandals. " I think aloud too much. Oh, yeah. ok. I also said I wanted to be a marine biologist and she reminded me how afraid I am of sharks. I don't know what she is trying to do to me. 
__label__label0 I just got back from your class, so I decided that I should start to type this paper. I am very happy with my classes, even though I feel like they are going to be rather difficult this year, especially my Calculus class. I have a hard time understanding what my professor is saying. I end up have to go home and teach myself most of the information. Well that's enough about school. I just thought about my exgirlfriend. I have very strong emotions about her. I know that she was my first love. But I also am so mad at sometimes. We had talked about me going off to college and we knew that it probably would work about, so we decided that we would date other people. From my experience this really does work out. The first girl that I dated after her was a girl from my waiting job in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I decided that I should tell my exgirlfriend, whose name is PROPNAME, about the girl. This was a very big mistake. Genie came to the restaurant where I worked and caused a big scene. But this isn't the only thing that makes me mad. Things are totally different now that we decided to see other people. We don't get along and we can't talk to each other. I think women need to just make up their mind. They all act like want this perfect gentlemen that does everything for them, but when the actually get that they don't know how to treat it. Usually the go to far and try to take advantage of it and then the guy starts to despise the girl. I don't really wish that things were back the way they were, I just wish that we could still get along. I really miss talking to her. She was a person that I could tell everything to and still feel comfortable about doing so. I am lucky though, because I have a sister that I am very close to. She also goes to ORGNAME and she has been a very big help with getting me settled in here in LOCNAME. She only lives a couple of blocks away from me and she is there for me whenever I need anything, as I am for her. This is my freshman year and I am already dreaming that college would be over. It isn't that I don't enjoy Austin or College, it is just that I am tired of school. I wish that there could be a step in your life that you could just skip, but that is impossible. I would love to just be able to be settled in to a good paying job, but since that will never happen I am prepared to work now to enjoy the benefits later. 
__label__label0 Today I had my third day of classes at ORGNAME. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to ORGNAME so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in LOCNAME, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. 
__label__label1 Well I am sitting here in my dorm room wondering what I am doing here. I am eighteen years old, and well in four days will actually be nineteen. I cannot believe that I am in college. The past three weeks of classes have been very overwhelming. I did not really know what to expect, and well I still don't know. After the first two days of classes I called home crying because I did not now how exactly to study for classes even if I did not have homework or a test the following day. I am kind of getting into the swing of things. Last night my ex boyfriend called which really surprised I me. He wasn't really my boyfriend but we were for sure dating. About a week and a half ago I found out that he was dating another girl at the same time that he was dating me. I was really upset when I found out but for some reason I never cried. I usually cry over the littlest things but this time I didn't. It's not that I wasn't upset but I think that I was trying to be a stronger person. Anyways, back to the point, I can't believe that he called. I am really excited because on Sunday I am going to meet my parents in LOCNAME LOCNAME to go to dinner for my birthday. My mom keeps asking me what I want for my birthday, but I don't really know. My friend PROPNAME just walked into my room. I told her to leave because I don't want to lose my train of thought. That is the problem with living in the dorm. People just walk in and out of my room and it is really hard to get things done. My roommate and I usually lock our door so no one can disturb us. Oh, about two and a half months ago I got a speeding ticket and I have to take defensive driving. I rented the defensive driving video from Blockbuster today. The video was so boring. I really miss my sister. She is so great to me. Last night I was thinking how weird, well it isn't really weird, but almost every time we get off the phone we say, "I love you. " It is not weird to me but I don't think that most brothers and sisters say I love you every time they get off of the phone. I don't know I guess I just think it is cool that we have such a close relationship between one another. I sometimes think what I would do if I lost her or didn't have a sister as great as her. Sometime she can be really rude to me but for the most part she is such a great sister. Speaking of great people, I love my parents so much. I have never really realized how much they really care about me and worry about me until I went off to college. The day that I called them crying they were so worried about me. I called them again that night and they were so relieved that I was feeling better. Also, yesterday I felt really sick and my told me that she wished that she could be here to take care of me. My family is probably the greatest thing that I have in my life. What I really wish for right now is to make at least a 0. 0 this first semester. I am going to try really hard. I know I can do it I just have to keep up with my studies and work really hard. So far I think I am doing good in studying. I am really trying to balance out study time and play time. I can't believe how much my mind switches from subject to subject. This is awesome. I have just typed so much in just twenty minutes. 
__label__label1 I am really tired right now. Yesterday, PROPNAME (my roommate) and I went at 00:00 at night to PROPNAME PROPNAME to lift. I really have to use the restroom right now, so I will be right back. Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 0. 0 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. LOCNAME vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 000 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 000 people in it, and that is 00 more people than in my graduating class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME last May. Well, it has been 00 minutes. Bye!  
__label__label1 I met this guy PROPNAME Thursday and today we had breakfast together. I really like him, but I don't know how to express myself around him. I get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. I have a nervous tick in my stomach when I think of him, like now. I feel like calling or emailing him, but I can't find the guts to. At breakfast, it took my five minutes before I could stop shaking. No one noticed but I could feel my knees quiver. School is not exactly what I thought it would be. There is so much reading, and I don't know if I'm absorbing it all into my brain. So many fun things to do, I make myself sit and read. I try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. I try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but I suffer as much failure as I do success. I have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and I'm lucky if I get the times and meeting places correct. I guess that's why I bought a cool UT planner which I carry with me everywhere! My mom was the same way I am. She procrastinated more in college than I am and did very well. I don't want to fail. I think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and I zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. I miss the familiar faces and places of LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. Tears come to my eyes. I haven't cried in a very long time, not even when I came back from the long Labor Day weekend. When I talk on the phone with my parents I swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. I want to succeed here and I'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. As a little girl, I came to many UT football games. My dream was to be a student here. Considering I was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. I love the university and I'm glad I choose UT over LOCNAME LOCNAME. ORGNAME does have the best Speech Pathology program in the state, but I can not see myself anywhere, but here. When I think of that the sadness goes away, but I'm still left with an incredible amount of work that I am trying to accomplish. My dad works very hard. He only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. I can't tell if he likes work. He almost hates his sister's husband. I don't like him either. A total jerk and I feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. I think my dad is happy. He always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. He loved it. He was an average student in high school, most likely had ADD or ADHD. We've always been close, but sometimes I feel like he disregards my feelings. We're both athletic, but I got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. Sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and I, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. I hope he knows I love him very much. 
__label__label0 Today has been a pretty good day, I guess. It's Thurs. , so it's closer to the weekend, which always makes life feel better, for one reason or another. I've had a lot of homework, and I know that the fun is only just beginning. I hope that somehow I will be able to keep a healthy balance between social life and school life. So far, I honestly think I've been spending more time studying and reading for class than doing anything else. My dorm floor seems kind of rowdy at times. I just wonder how all these people can just go out and hang around and do all this stuff all the time. Don't they have homework, too? I wish that I was just really really really smart so that I wouldn't have to work so hard to understand things, especially things that seem relatively simple to many other people. I went to the SI group for Psychology today, and I really liked it, although we didn't cover much class material, considering it was our first SI meeting. However, I like the small atmosphere, and I like PROPNAME. I think that if I have any questions, it will be easy to have them answered then. I'm starting to worry about not making new friends and stuff. I guess it will all work out in time and I'm just feeling insecure for no reason. I would like to have someone to go to the game with Sat. (today is Thurs. , Sept. 0), but my closest friend here has to work, and I haven't met anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to go together. Oh well, that will all work out, too, I suppose. I kind of like this writing thing, because it's like writing in a journal, and I think it's healthy to write about feelings and such. Sometimes I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing with my life in general. I'm undeclared in school, and I have no real idea of what I should do with my life in the future. Certainly one day I will recognize that I have a specific purpose to serve. I would like to figure that out, soon, though. Tonight I'm going to ORGNAME with my roommate. We grew up together. I really like mocha and caramel frappacinos. It's really interesting to me how popular coffee drinks are now. We had a discussion about this in my sociology class. It's such a trend right now. I'm starting to get tired of writing, now. I have that irritable feeling where it's just almost miserable to sit here and do this. Well, it's really not that bad, actually, I just want to get this over with. check it off my list of things to do. My family misses me! They're very proud that I'm here, though. I hope that I can continue to make them proud. I guess that all depends on the tests. I don't even know what to expect. I just pray that I won't do that terribly bad. I'm definitely going to do my best. Okay, six more minutes. Do you know how long six minutes is when you're sleeping and about to get up? I cherish those last few minutes in bed, really I do. My mom called me this morning about forty minutes before my alarm went off. That was annoying, but luckily, I had no problem falling asleep again. I can't believe some people that have worked at the University get paid only $00,000 a year in some cases. That's incredible. I'm not sure a strike is appropriate, because students are paying money to be taught, but still I was shocked to hear that from Prof PROPNAME. Girls keep screaming down the hall and I feel like I'm nine years old at summer camp. That's weird. I've been thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. I'm thinking that it would be easier to study if I lived off campus, but easier to get involved by living on. Maybe next year I'll try getting an apartment and see how that goes. Well, my time is almost up. Bye. 
__label__label0 Today has been a pretty uneventful and boring day. I've been to two of my three classes today. I was starting to fall asleep in my stats class. It's my most boring class of the day. I still have to go to my Rhetoric class. It's pretty boring too. I'm not a very good writer at all. I don't much enjoy going to class. I don't apply myself to school near as much as I should. I say I'm going to study but then I put it off until the last second. I guess there are a lot of people that do too. I'm pretty bad though. I don't study hardly at all and make B's and C's. I don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but I do feel stupid for not studying and trying. Then I could get all A's and B's. I'm a pretty laid back guy. Things don't bother me very easily. but when they do, I can't get them off my mind until their resolved. I live with three other guys. They can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. I have a girlfriend that I've been with for a year and a half. We don't fight very much. She gets mad at me a lot more than I get mad at her. She never use to get mad at me. But then a few weeks before I moved down to LOCNAME she started. I think it's because she had stay home and finish school and I got to come down to LOCNAME and experience new things. I feel that I don't love her as much as I use to. My twenty minutes is up so I'm going to go to English. This wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be. 
__label__label0 I guess I'm just supposed to write what I'm thinking right now. I love listening to music. I guess it releases some kind ORGNAME hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. If I'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, I can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME is majoring in that I think. I really miss PROPNAME. He's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. I can't wait to talk to him today  I've already done all of my homework for today and I don't have any more classes today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my hard days. I had a rhetoric class that I was taking but I'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression  she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. I think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. I want to be happy when I'm older  I want to be a child psychiatrist. But as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so I'm going to have to wait on that one. I want to continue to medical school, but I don't know where I want to apply for that. I have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. Oh  My favorite song is on  one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. Okay I have ten more minutes. Okay, my shoes are too small! Have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? It really is painful  I hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 0 and a half and a 0 would make me look like I have clown feet. If you have size 0 feet I'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. I'm just talking about me. I hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else  you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. Maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. But who even cares about that stuff now. Not me! But that's okay. I took an ORGNAME ORGNAME course last year in high school and I loved it. It's what got me interested in Psychology in the first place. I was going to be a photojournalist. But after taking the psych class I decided that I really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. Photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. I also was watching a show on TLC on a family vacation to LOCNAME (dad's idea) and it was an ER show and I really thought that was interesting. I can be easily inspired. Okay my time is up. 
__label__label1 I am so overwhelmed that I don't even know what to do anymore. If it isn't one subject then it is another. I finally think that I am ahead in at least once subject and then I look at the syllabus and it says that I am, in actuality, 0 chapters behind. I really don't understand how this all happens. I thought that when I came to college it would be different. I thought that I would get to have a fresh start at things. I thought I would be able to make myself study and get ahead; however, my predictions are proving to be wrong. I am getting further and further behind with every passing day. I have psychology chapters to read, interpersonal communications chapters to read, contemporary moral problems readings, psychology writing assignments, MIS homework and readings. Even if I had all my time to study I still wouldn't be able to get it all done. But that isn't even the issue. Not only do I have all of these things to do, but there are also people asking me every five seconds to go out and enjoy LOCNAME. I don't have time to enjoy Austin. I don't have time to go out, go to sorority meeting, read, write, and keep my sanity all in one day. There just is not enough time. I try and try to manage my time, but it just is not working. I think my only solution is to lock myself in my room and not come out until all of my work for the rest of the semester is done. That is my only solution to my ongoing problem. 
__label__label1 I just woke up and I'm a little confused as I try to figure out what subject I should be studying and which assignments I should be working on. This is all new to me. High school was nothing like this, never had to study. Now I really know what stress is supposed to feel like. Not that the classes are tough yet. I guess I'm used to being lazy. The food here is getting old and I'm scared of gaining that "freshman 00. " Tonight family is coming in, can't wait, a nice paid for meal. Lately I've been feeling sad. I parted from my 0 best friends a month ago to be here and now I can see how much I really depended on them. My life is so different. I have to try and fit into the friendships that were already made here this summer during provisionals. It's not fun. They're all in the sorority and I'm sick of going out every night. I talked to my best friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME everyday either on the phone or Internet. I don't know what I'd do without AIM. I miss them so much. I'm going home this weekend I need to see some familiar faces. I'm not one to be homesick I just feel I have no sort of comfort zone here even though I should. I mean my brother lives here but has his own life with his job and girlfriend. So I barely get to see him ever. I've been really sad the past 0 weeks. It's just been really hard. My boyfriend of 0 months is in the ORGNAME and lives in 00 Palms, LOCNAME. He doesn't get much time off with his new duties that he was promoted to so he had 00 hours off during Labor Day weekend and drove 0000miles to see me. I can't even believe it still, that 00hour drive had to be horrible. That's what keeps me going everyday. How much I can see by the way he's shown me, how much he cares and loves me that he would come all the way here. He finally bought a cell phone so we could talk easier instead of him waiting in the 0hour phone lines they have at the payphones everyday. He's also getting a job for his days off at a western wear store. He wants more money, he's so responsible, as if being in the marines isn't hard enough work already. Its really expensive with all the gas to drive here all they time and the flights are just crazy. I'm going to try and fly there for his birthday. I know my parents would absolutely kill me. I love him so much and we're of different religions so almost for a year now I've had to deal with my parents. I can't stand it, its drives me crazy inside sometimes how disapproving they are of someone they won't even get to know. It's not fair to me. They should be happy as long as he makes me happy. I would never not be with someone because of a religion that they were born into. Not to mention, the fact that we're both not deeply committed to our religions or were brought up that way. I can feel the tension and hurt coming up in the future. When he gets out we will be very close. He'll go to LOCNAME and we'll be together everyday, hopefully for the rest of our lives. I don't know, its just one more thing added on to my stress factors. Sometimes it's just easier to cry it all out but when I let that happen sometimes it lasts for almost 00 hours straight and I make myself sick. I've been sick all week and I hate it. I should be studying and I can't focus or keep myself to concentrate. I have to learn. I have to stick with it. I've decided I'm not going to go out at night unless it's a big function that I care about. It's not worth it. The party scene is old. I've been coming up to Austin the past 0 years for the big parties, pat O's, LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they just don't do anything for me anymore. I guess that would probably be because I don't drink and I don't' care to "hook up" with anyone so basically since those are the 0 main reasons that those fraternities have parties, they really just don't interest me. I'm personally fine with going to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends and renting a sappy movie and eating a lot of junk food. But that's just me. Something I do love here though is that I don't shower to go to class, don't get dressed up nor have I touched my make up bag since I left home. How fun is that? I love it. I just really don't care. Basically my plan is to try and focus on my studies, I won't have any boys here to distract me cause the only one I love isn't here. I'll do well in school and in the end we'll be able to be together. He has about 0 year and 00months left, but I figure I can make it. I mean he's already been in there for 0yrs and 0months and I've stood by his side the entire time, even before he joined. He means the world to me. I just can't even imagine my life without him and that's why I plan on staying with him. I know people think I'm dumb, that I'm wasting my college years staying committed to a long distance relationship, but I don't know why it would be dumb. As long as I'm happy why should I care right? I don't know, this whole college thing is really going to take some getting used to. I mean, me, doing my own laundry? That's just funny. 
__label__label1 Ever since I came to the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME I have been thinking about playing soccer. I turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. I wanted to come here because I know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. After going to the football game I could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 00,000 people. I can picture myself right now dribbling 0 players and scoring a magnificent goal. Every one around me would be cheering like crazy and I would be the big man on campus. Right now, I am wondering if I have made the right decision whether or not I should have come here. Not only did I do very well in soccer, but I also got very good grades in high school. So, I made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. As of now I am glad with the decision I have made. I am having a blast over here. Especially your class. It is the best. My class consists of about 000 people. That is a huge number. That was the size of my high school class in LOCNAME LOCNAME. In my Psychology class right now I have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom I like. I am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if I kissed her. I am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. I know they must be very lonely. I just hope that their health remains in very good condition. I already told them that they have to live to be at least 00 years old. In high school towards the end I started to slack off. I told my parents that I would get very good grades so I have to study a lot this year. I am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. My sister is going to ORGNAME ORGNAME and is majoring in psychology. If I ever need help or anything I can always call her. She is a junior right now. Ever since I got here, I have been missing my cat very much. I have a picture of him next to my bed so I can see him every now and then. I can't wait to go home for the weekend. THANKS! 
__label__label0 As I begin to write this essay, I am thinking of what my mind is doing in preparation for writing. I began going through ideas that have come to me earlier this day, trying to find one that I might be able to write about for 00 minutes. I can hear the TV on in the background. It's Monday Night Football, so my mind continues to convince my eyes to look over to my left and look at the teams that are playing. However, I know that I need to write this essay, so I have made a pact with myself not to look over until I'm done. I am occasionally checking my watch to see how long I have been writing. I started at 0:00pm, so I will be done at 0:00. PROPNAME PROPNAME's voice is somewhat distracting since he doesn't sound like the normal, professional voice of a sports announcer, and I laugh at his jokes only because they are not that funny. Now I'm trying to think of something else, only because I know this essay was meant to show what my mind thinks of on it's own, and not my personal opinion of the football game on TV. I temporarily blanked out, and there was nothing I could think of to write, so I stopped and stretched my hands and neck. Even though I am concentrating on the computer screen in front of me, my ears have nothing better to do than listen to the ads. I don't think it's a good thing that I am able to tell there was a car ad on just because of the music playing in the background. However, I suppose that is why advertisers pick certain kinds of music. They're hoping that it will stick in the minds of the viewers and they'll buy that certain product. I do not know the specific car that was just advertised based on the music, but I am sure that it was some sort of truck that was being advertised as a tough, strong vehicle. The idea of advertising reminds me that I want to go into the college of communications. I know I am a creative and artistic person, so I want a career that will utilize my abilities and something that I can personally enjoy. I would love to be involved with an advertising team coming up with ideas for companies, or a sports photographer. In high school, I was the Photography Editor for the school newspaper. I took many photos for the sports section, and I truly enjoyed standing on the sidelines at the football games and taking pictures. By being so close to the players, I got to understand their true size and feel the emotions going on during the game. Now that I've seen what that's like, I know that when one watches a game from the stands, they are missing out on some of the action and emotion. However, after going to the UT game this past weekend, I realized that the crowd has its own vibe that is also fun to be a part of. As that streak of thought came to an end, I glanced down at my watch and noticed the time was merely 00 seconds away from 0:00, so by now my time is done. 
__label__label1 So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 0. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 0 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to PROPNAME and PROPNAME I love them, one of my best friends, PROPNAME and I used to always sing to "Cecilia". PROPNAME goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 0 classes tomorrow and 0 on Friday. Monday I have 0 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to PROPNAME but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 00:00 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 0 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 0¸ hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie "Bring it On" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 00 minutes! Bye 
__label__label0 i am now writing my stream of consciousness I don't think one needs punctuation or me for that matter. so hmmm I did this for english last year for literature we have a very big psychology class kind of silly if you ask me my friend is going to school in LOCNAME with only 0000 people his classes have around 00 people awww to go in debt for education my parents moved with the money they saved by me staying in state. oh well it's safe here its home I don't really think about garland too much. online all of the time new phenomenon are incredible what would I have done 0 years ago. watched tv? is the internet as bad as tv? at least its interactive, you know? wow 00 minutes is a lot of writing I love music I'm going to learn so much music at the radio station this year I hope I like it there hmm I wonder how hard my classes will be I found a passion in economics (oxymoron, I know) hmm people are not always too responsible but I guess I'm not either, as the years have rolled on, I little backwards, I know. hablas espanol, ojala que hable espanol bien en enero that worries me you know? I don't want to lose the knowledge I don't know its like I think the same boring things class schedules and stuff over and over again and I don't really want to write about them I can't believe I'm doing this early I guess we all have that crazy initiative at the BEGINNING of the school year, I really do want to do well, though I've tried so hard thus far so why stop now, or maybe I should because I tried so hard before this college thing has worked out oddly like its not really that much of a life change I guess I knew it was coming or something I'm not homesick its like "ok, well now I'm here and not there anymore" why don't I miss my family? because I really don't maybe I will later but it has been a week. weird sometimes I don't feel that m, no things don't make me feel anything, I chose to react to them like that (says mom the rogerian counselor) why am I taking psychology again I already took the ib test and I did pretty well only you don't know what that is I bet yeah ib is bad down with ib oh well liberal arts education will help you know I need to get my confidence back up, I'm smart I've had a great education, better than most ok I know I'm just practical so there typing is nice and fast my handwriting is not too marvelous ha ha that sounds like something out of catcher and the rye or something I love holden so true yet so extreme. I need to read more I need to be more well read typing typing typing I didn't do this in word uhh maybe I should ask you if it's ok not to do it in word, don't answer that I want to live dangerously interesting huh you think instructions to a vacuum cleaner is interesting reading? I would hate to see your library, to each his own (for the sake of politeness) I like typing a lot I bet my roommate thinks I'm all crazy at work or probably writing an im. huh I don't know don't want to talk about the boring things that go through my head everyday. college the university de tejas. cliches I'm becoming a cliche I think most college kids are last night some people were acting like they were drunk or "buzzing" but you could tell they probably just had a beer and were playing it up that's pretty annoying hey let's order pizza because we're in college, where does this hostility come from to each his own my a** hmmm ok um um um I like to sleep I don't like high school and now I am gone, what will I fill my days with? probably, hopefully, not much. class just wont be that hard all of the excess time has been squeezed out like water form a sponge that is efficient like like efficiency and efficient market dang I like economics where is art history going? good thing I'm a business major what a relief that I like it yeah never mind so where are you from? what's your major? really my friend's doing that water fruit I'm not getting fat its peaceful, typing I wish I was a more accurate typist, I think that about sums me up sloppy BUT fast as a mug ha ha how funny haste makes waste you know! *tsk tsk* yep wow time flies when you typing about yourself, yeah I understand I wouldn't want to read these either. imagine it being your job to read a bunch of pretentious, half ass papers from a class of 000 I'm sorry you have to do that ms. ta. hmmm ta huh I almost went to berkeley I glad I didn't it would have been too hard I'm tired of too hard, see above I'm sure it is there, its always there time to let go 
__label__label0 As I begin writing this I am a little annoyed because I'm doing it on my friends computer mine is broken. I wish I could just get my computer to work and be dependable. Also as I'm typing I'm thinking ahead as of what to say I guess I shouldn't do that or maybe that's just the way I think. The phone just started ringing but I'm not even going to answer it. I've been laying around all night watching a movie with a girl I used to like a lot. She's a beautiful girl and part of me still likes her but oh well. Things are different now and I don't really mind that. Also I've recently decided that I didn't want to be in a fraternity. I always thought I would, but really it just wasn't my thing. Right now I'm kind of kicking myself because I'm missing out on partying, but at the same time I hated the amount of time I spent doing stuff at the house. I felt like every one was here to party and study on the side. I wish I could do that but I can't, I need to do well in school. This weekend is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I'm very excited. The concert is two nights and I'm going to both. PROPNAME is my favorite musician and I've been looking forward to it for a long time. Also it is very hot in this room where I'm typing I wish that I could just some how make it like fifty degrees in here. I really like the cold weather and am looking forward to a break from the heat in the upcoming months. I think I like the cold because I'm hot natured, but also because I have good memories of winters. I love to reflect on the Christmas with my grandparents. As I glance down at my watch I see that my time is almost up so I guess I'll try to muster something great up. I don't know I'm a blank. I do however miss my family a little. I really miss my brother. It's odd because we always used to annoy each other but now I'd really get a kick out of seeing him. 
__label__label0 I am sad. I just started thinking about the dog I left behind in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. That isn't exactly why I am sad though. It seems weird to me that I am really missing my dog and hardly ever thinking about my mom and dad. It isn't that I don't love my mom or dad but something must have gone wrong considering this is my first time away from them and I am hardly talking to them at all. If my mom sends me an email is usually says something like: nothing new here, PROPNAME's now. PROPNAME is my dog. I really feel like my dog is more important to my mom then I am. At least she has always spent more time with him. I am getting teary eyed which is weird because I haven't cried in years and I don't think I have anything to cry about now. My roommate's mom calls him every single night. I have talked to her more then I have talked to my mom since I have been here. I haven't heard a word from my dad at all. Oddly enough I don't really miss my friends back home. We have been very close since sixth grade and I just left them. For some odd reason this really doesn't bother me. I can't stop thinking about how much your class stresses me out. It seems so easy. I know it won't be easy though, and that makes we question how much time I should be spending on it now. I almost had a panic attack when I saw that the website was down but it is now back up and that makes me feel okay. I am really hungry which is weird because I just ate a piece of ham, a piece of turkey, sweet potatoes, a piece of pecan pie, broccoli and cheese, and a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. Isn't that nuts. PROPNAME 00/0 is now on. That is an awesome show. It really hits hard without showing gruesome ER scenes (it is a documentary series). I lost my train of thought and I am now writing about nothing. Well, my twenty minutes are up. Bye. 
__label__label0 The walk was refreshing. I should do that more often. I am not sure why not many people take advantage of the beauty of nature and fresh air, and the flowers. My mother loves gardening. We always complain that she spends more time on the garden than on her children. It is just me, my brother and my Dad. Ours is a small family. Not like my neighbors. They have six children. Must be very noisy to live in that family. I like peace and quite when I watch TV or study. I do not think there are any good programs on tonight. I have never watched The West Wing or Will and Grace. Both won the Emmy. They are probably not my type. I just like Friends. This summer there were not any good movies also. Summer really ended so fast. I miss my friend, "S". I don't know what it would be like to be at ORGNAME ORGNAME with her. It is a shame she did not get admission at LOCNAME. I would have loved to share a room with her. My suite mate is OK. I had lunch with her but we do not have much in common. She is much younger and is in drama. I am in Natural Sciences. I am not sure how I decided on Pre Med. and maybe Business. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher and my brother told me that it would not make me rich. Money is not everything. Well if I become a doctor, i. e. if I ever pass my ORGNAME. Why is life so difficult. I wish life was easier and we could do what we wanted. Better still I wish we did not have to grow up and worry about having a family or making money. I think it is getting warm. I need to turn on the AC. My room mate must be cold blooded. I need circulating air. It keeps me refreshed and relaxed. I am not sure why my parents moved to LOCNAME from LOCNAME. I love the snow and the cold. "T", my friend in LOCNAME, has not replied to my email and she does not even like Instant messaging. I think it is neat that we can do that. I can make friends easily on the net, but face to face is really hard. Everyone thinks I am shy and they are probably true. I had no idea 00 minutes are so long and you can write so much. When I am doing something enjoyable time flies and now it seems that the clock does not move. I need to change this chair. It is so uncomfortable or maybe I can put a pillow on it. I think I will go for another walk after I am done with this. I wander if there is anything good on TV tonight. That fish I ate in the cafeteria is making me sick. I hate the food they serve. I am glad I am going home this weekend. 
__label__label1 When I came to LOCNAME I thought that school was going to be very difficult and that I would not meet anyone new. These are both wrong. So far I have met many new people and I feel as if school is not going to be as hard as I had expected. I love my classes and the diversity of students in them. Diversity to some people is a bad thing, but I love it. I think it is great to any environment to have people from every different ethnic or religious background. My favorite band, the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, has a lead singer named PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is from LOCNAME LOCNAME, although he is Caucasian, he considers himself to be of a South African background. He sings many songs that talk about the problems with diversity in the world today and in years before. He is a great man and I love his songs. I went to the concert in LOCNAME last night and watched the people around. Everyone seems to love him. I feel that he is my inspiration. His songs have such meaning and I feel that every song that he sings relates to me in some way. During the concert he was so moved by his music that he would dance and play around on stage. He is such an entertainer and performer that it would be impossible for anyone not to like him or his band. Each person on the band has a unique talent. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the violinist, and can play jams for hours at a time. He is very talented and used to have a band of his own before he joined the PROPNAME PROPNAME Band. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the wind instrument player. I cannot really specify what instrument he plays because he plays over 00 different instruments, and all of which he plays to perfection. During concerts he must where sunglasses because he is so shy that he closes his eyes during the entire time of which he is playing. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the drummer. He is probably the most talented member of the band, besides PROPNAME of course. Recently he was ranked the number one drummer in the world. Another member of the band is PROPNAME PROPNAME. He plays the bass guitar for the band. He joined the band in his junior year of high school. He is the youngest member of the band. Finally, PROPNAME Matthews plays lead acoustic guitar for the band. He is probably one of the most talented songwriters in the world today. The band last year had the highest profit grossing summer tour which made over 00 million dollars. Before Dave started the band he used to bartend at a local bar in LOCNAME called PROPNAME's. This is important because he met all the members of the band bartending at that bar. He ended up starting the band in 0000 and didn't get all the members to actually commit until 0000. Every year the band becomes more popular and more popular. But, the initial reason why the band became so popular in the very beginning was because the band allowed fans to plug into the soundboard and create tapes. These tapes where then copied and passed onto many other people, and through this very system of tape trading the band's popularity grew at exponential rates. Nowadays, people can just use Napster to trade songs, but back in the early nineties people actually had to trade the tapes in person or through the mail. This band is my inspiration and I hope that they will live forever in my mind and in the mind of the people who hears their music. 
__label__label0 Right now, I am feeling a little tired, a little overwhelmed, excited, and also a little afraid. I am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise. I am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that I have found myself in in the last couple of weeks. Its not really that I am overloaded with work (yet), it is just that I am still getting used to everything here: new and different classes, new ways of studying and testing, new teachers and techniques of teaching, etc. I am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings: a new room, roommate, sleeping schedule, eating schedule, etc. I am excited because I think I am going to enjoy living and going to school here. I am excited about taking courses that I'm actually interested in, and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing. I am excited about meeting new people. One of the things that I enjoy most about LOCNAME is the diversity of the people you can find here. No matter what kind of person you are, you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns. I have already met some very fascinating people. Austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the ORGNAME. If I'm not mistaken, it is the music capitol of the world. I could go on for a long time about all the reasons why I am excited. I am afraid mainly for the same reasons that I am overwhelmed. Mostly I am afraid that I do not know how to take notes and study properly. I find myself looking at others people's notes during lecture to see if I am writing down the important things and whether or not I am getting the point. My mom says that in time, I will learn what to write down, read, and study. I have never been a very good test taker. My biggest fear of all is the fact that I have always relied on the one on one attention that I received from my teachers in the past to get me through school. Now that I am attending the largest University in the county, I know that that is impractical. However, I plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids. With an average of 000 students in your classes, I know that you cannot offer that same oneonone environment. That is my greatest concern. 
__label__label0 It's 00:00 at night. I'm tired, and I hate doing homework. I don't want to do homework. Homework is EVIL. Studying is evil. School is evil. All I want to do is be on the internet and surf, chat, and download. MP0s. You can never have enough mp0s. This Ethernet is so fast! I love it. That's the only thing I like about college. The computer has made me antisocial. I don't need people, just need my computer. Haven't really met and made many new friends. Why? Because I'm always in my room. Because I'm always on the computer. I choose it over other things. Things like studying. Pikachu is lonely. He's sitting on my bed all by himself. Just sits there. Jester food is disgusting. I don't like it, but sometimes you have no choice but to eat it. Nasty. PROPNAME is better. Eating in my room is good. I have better food in the closet. I mean, jester food isn't as horrible as it sounds, just that it's so fattening. Just about anything on the main course menu has over 00% of the daily fat intake. That's way too much. Worried about calculus. I hate math. Got really bad teachers for math in high school, so now I'm paying the price. I wish I had better teachers. Wish the room was colder. Still got to study tonight before I can go to bed. Got to study calculus. Have a quiz on Thursday. And a chemistry quiz too. It's so hot outside. I don't want to go out. Adding on to antisocialness. It's better at night when it's cooler. I like it cooler. The internet is so fast. I think I will live on campus next year just for the Ethernet access. Sounds like a stupid reason. But it's reason enough for me to stay. I hate working out. It's hard work and I sweat. Is the 00 minutes up yet? I don't think so, almost time. Hahah. Then I will be done with this evil homework assignment. I'm tired. I want to sleep. There's a stupid paperclip on my screen. I'm in word right now because my spelling sucks. And I don't care. The computer takes care of it for me. Told you the computer is a great great friend. Who needs real people when you have the computer? I've never eaten ants before. I don't think I want to eat insects. Survivor was a good show. I tried to watch it every week. I liked summer. Did nothing. I wish it was summer again. I got post it notes in the mail today. I am happy. Stupid people complain to me about stupid things like hurting feet. Food is good. School is evil. It's the devil! Ok! Yay! My time is up. Good bye. 
__label__label0 Okay, I guess this is what all my English teachers described as "stream of consciousness. " I believe I did an assignment similar to this in 00th grade. I'm not sure. I wonder how long this writing assignment will be. How much can I possibly type for 00 minutes straight without stopping? What if I get a phone call? Do I answer it? Anyways, I cannot believe I am in my second week of college. It is kind of what I expected. The freedom can me nice at times, but I do miss my home. I do not miss high school at all though. I didn't like high school one bit. I am more homesick than I ever thought I would be, or could be for that matter. I never thought of myself as someone who would get homesick. But here I am, always wanting to call home. PROPNAMEORGNAME birthday is tomorrow. I wish I could fly down to spend the day with her. I hope mom remembers to give her the CD I made her. The CD reminds me of PROPNAME, whom I also miss a lot. I miss all my friends, all my best friends. One of which is at UTD, one going to Northwestern in a few days, and one attending ORGNAME ORGNAME's. I really wish I could transfer, or they would transfer to UT. I miss them all so much. Wow, it has only been 0 minutes. I don't know if I have 00 minutes of gibberish to write about. This stream of consciousness thing is harder than it seems. I know I tend to ramble on a lot but it is quite different when you are doing it for a class assignment. It is also hard for me because I am so used to typing with abbreviations every time I chat online, making this assignment a lot more difficult. After completing this, I am going to wait for a phone call from my best friend. Then, meet up with someone at the library, where I hope to get a lot of studying done. I feel like I am so behind in all my classes. I have a lot of reading to do. Senioritis has not gone away, and I have yet to get back into the "homework mode. " That's not good. I really would like to leave here with a high GPA. I know that is what my parents would really like. Yet, it seems harder and harder as days go by. There are so many things to do here that it seems harder to organize my week. I am usually a very organized person but haven't been as of late. Man, I wonder if PROPNAME is going to call me anytime soon. I feel like I haven't talked to her in forever. I would really like to fly down and stay with her for a weekend. I'm thinking about the weekend of her birthday. Though, I'm not sure if that is a good idea. I need to get the money together first. Oh yeah, I also need to get some money for PROPNAME's birthday gift. It's her birthday tomorrow. Wow, I wish my friends would chip in money and buy me a camera. That's really neat that Ivy is doing that. I'm so glad I finally got my camera fixed. Stupid battery. How does a battery die out so quickly? I haven't even had my camera for that long. I put up my collages today before lunch. They look really nice on my wall. I think I put them up crooked though. Oh well, I will get used to it, I hope. I would really like to fill up my whole wall with it. That would be so neat! Okay, 0 more minutes. Man, I haven't typed this much in a long time. My eyes are starting to hurt now, and I still have a headache. Today is Monday. Tomorrow is Tuesday. Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day, from beginning to end. I will probably be dead tired by the end of the day and won't have enough energy to study. That will not be good. I want to watch TV. I wonder what is on right now. PROPNAME said she was going to watch friends and then LOCNAME. All right, now I am running out of things to type. I don't think my brain works very fast. These last few minutes are going by very slowly. I hope I don't get hungry tonight at the library. I cannot believe I ate so much today at lunch. It is all Leeting's fault. All that starch cannot be good for me. I really hope I do not gain a lot of weight while in college. I'm really scared that I will. I haven't been going to the gym as often as I would like. I think I might start going every Friday or so. Maybe on the weekends too, seeing as how I haven't been in LOCNAME for the weekend since school started. Maybe that is why I still have not put together a regular schedule. I haven't really been here for a full week. Well, this will be my first full week in college. Not as exciting as I thought it would be. I think I might call home after I finish this assignment. I'm almost done, thank goodness. I really am running out of things to type. I think I am all drained out. I hope I do not fall asleep studying tonight. I really need to get stuff done. 
__label__label0 I have so many stressors in my life right now, and I've decided that since I have to do this stream of consciousness exercise anyway, this is probably the best place to vent. While being a freshman on a campus of 00,000 people is intimidating and scary, it isn't nearly as threatening as people made it out to be  at least not yet. My current stressful situations lie in areas of my life that have nothing to do with college. To be honest, right now, my biggest problem is with my parents. After being divorced for some time now, they have just gotten to the point where they have started to fight and bicker about everything, and of course, I always end up in the middle. My mother complains about how difficult her life is because of my father, which I'm sure it is. This is not to say that he is a perfect person, because I know he is not, but the way she portrays him, you would think that he is not human. My father is very critical and judgmental of everything my mother does, and the both of them feel the constant need to tell me how they feel about the other. Now, I am adult enough to realize that after a bitter divorce, there will certainly be problems. They have every right in the world to be furious with each other. All I ask is that they do not drag me into the middle of it. I have told them both this on several occasions, and they both apologize and vow to not do it again. However, before long, they are up to the same old game again, and it makes me feel about 0 inches tall. I am forced to choose sides, and since I love both my parents, this provides for a very stressful situation. I am getting to the point that I am ready to tell them both that I will not speak to either of them or have any contact what so ever until they talk to each other and get at least to the point where they can tolerate living in the same city with one another. I don't ask that they try to love each other again, or even like each other, because those days are obviously through. I just want things to be relatively peaceful and not for there to be a war zone. Another result of this fighting is the separation of me and my siblings. This has nothing to do with the fact that I live on campus, my little sister lives with my mom, and my brother lives with my dad. While this isn't the ideal living situation, there is certainly nothing awful about it. What their fighting has caused is rifts between the kids. It has gotten to the point that we choose sides against our parents, and therefore, against each other. I feel like I can't say anything bad about my mother in front of my sister because she will just run back and report what I say. If I wanted to say those things to my mom, I would say them. I don't need a messenger. Dr PROPNAME, if you are reading this, I accidentally pressed send and did not get to complete my writing. I apologize and hope this doesn't cause any problems. Anyway, another problem I have with my family is the direct relationship between my mother and I. We have always had different personalities, and they have often clashed. We would sometimes go long periods of time when we were furious with each other, but for some reason, I feel that my current situation is the worst. She has recently undergone a lot of personal changes, mostly physical. She is in the process of discovering who she is, which is a perfectly normal thing to do after having a life as tumultuous as hers. She changed her last name, has dyed her hair several different colors, and is seriously considering a nose ring. Now, on an intellectual level, I totally understand her actions. If I were in her shoes, I would want to discover who I was also, and would feel hurt if my daughter did not approve. HOWEVER, these changes she has made still upset me immensely, and she cannot comprehend or accept why I feel this way. Until recently, I could not even explain it to myself. Through talking with a friend, I think I've begun to grasp why I have a problem with this. And here is my answer: the relationship a person has with their mother is supposed to be one of the most meaningful, important relationships of their lives. A mother, no matter how hard you try to escape her, will always be there for you and provide comfort and support. You KNOW who this person is, and they are usually a steady force in your life. Even before my mother began undergoing these changes, we had drifted apart so that I barely knew who she was. And now, after changing herself, I really don't know her. She does not seem to be a rock for my life. The hardest part for me is that she doesn't seem to care how I feel and that her changes upset me. I am not the most emotionally open person, but the fact that she was changing her name was upsetting me so that I actually confronted her about it. This is so unlike me, so I felt very vulnerable in my action. After I told her I was having a problem, she seemed sincerely concerned, and promised that we would talk about it further before she did anything. However, two days later, before we talked more, she went and changed her name anyway. I never asked her to change her life or actions for my sake. All I wanted was for her to know how I felt and that she was upsetting me. Honestly, I think this is a reasonable request. Her apparent disregard for my feelings hurt me tremendously, and we are on very bad terms at the present time. I feel very alone right now, and I'm not sleeping well. My appetite has gone down very much, and I can't seem to find pleasure in anything I do. The friends I had in high school have all moved away, and the new friends I've made at LOCNAME always seem to have more important things to do. I am nowhere near the top of anybody's priority list, and I often feel like if I were to just pack up and clear out, very few people would notice. Now, if anybody is reading this, don't think this is a plea of help from a person considering suicide. That thought doesn't come into my mind, I am just having a rough time. I know that one of Dr. PROPNAME's favorite stress relievers is to sit down and write about 'your deepest thoughts and feelings. ' At this point, I would have to agree with him that this exercise is very helpful and calms my nerves a bit. I don't know what I'll write about for other stream of consciousness exercises, because I've pretty much said everything of dire importance to me here on this page. I hope that if anybody in my life reads this and is upset by it, that they will understand that I have a special circumstance in Dr. PROPNAME's class, and I just want to be treated like all the other freshmen who have the opportunity to write and write without consequence. I know that this is just an assignment, but I truly appreciate this opportunity to vent my frustrations and do a little thinking. Thank you. 
__label__label1 Okay, 00 minutes. Hope I can turn this in on time! Blasted software! Need to get my car washed badly. Did so much driving this weekend. It's a good thing it rained though. It's so hot in LOCNAME. Man, I'm a horrible typist. Wonder why I never learned to type? My hamster's munching down! He eats so loud. Wish my snake would eat:( She's only eaten once in 0 0/0 weeks. Need to call PROPNAME. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Need to meditate on breath more frequently. Been slacking off on yoga practice. Should finish reading other book. Have to find out when that retreat is and how much it costs. Maybe PROPNAME would go too. Wonder where PROPNAME is? How was the concert? Should have gone. PROPNAME got a PROPNAME!? That's sweet. Can't wait to ride it. 0 more minutes. Oh yeah, getting close. Chicaboom Powpow. Ohhhh Yeeaah! Can't believe PROPNAME PROPNAME spun that track at the party. That shit was phat. He was offthehook! Man that night broke me though. Need to get a job. Bills suck. "Going to take a walk outside today. Going to see what we can find today. " PROPNAME rules. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. Good. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. Relax. In. Out. Feel much better now. More energized. Shoulders are tense though. Need to get a massage. Watched Yellow Submarine twice yesterday. Such a great movie. I Love the Beatles. Cartoons rock too. PROPNAME's boyfriend is an awesome painter. Oop. 00 minutes. Time up  
__label__label1 I'm supposed to write for twenty minutes. So I think that I will write about what I know the most about. I know the most about myself. Maybe this means I'm stuck up  because I'm writing about myself and not about something important, like homelessness or starvation and poverty and other things of that nature. But if that is the case, I will just have to be stuck up. I don't know that I really understand myself, so I'm not really sure what I should say. Sometimes, I'm fairly predictable. Other times, I just don't know why I do what I do. I guess everyone could say that about themselves, so I'm not being too original here. I'll try to think of something more original. I am weird. I wonder if everyone thinks that they are weird. I am not comfortable with love, yet I crave it. I close the door in love's face when it comes knocking. I like movie love. The kind where everything just ends happily ever after. PROPNAME is a perfect example. She finds the man of every woman's dreams, and gets him. I think I once found the man of my dreams. But I just wasn't ready to find him then. At least that will be my excuse for letting him get away. I wonder why people think that love is so important to find. I feel like it is the purpose of our being here. Do animals really search for the ONE? Or do they just find a new partner every season? Maybe that is what is supposed to set humans aside from animals. Everyone thinks that humans are so much smarter than animals. I think that maybe animals are much smarter. They don't mess with love. They just have mates. I bet their lives are less stressful. I guess love really isn't that stressful, as long as both people are in love. It seems to me that when you are in love, everything seems perfect. Life suddenly loses its stressfulness. I think the phrase is that it looks like you're looking at the world through rosetinted glass. Roses are nice. I love flowers in general. They smell good. They look pretty. They are such pointless gifts because they die so quickly once they are cut. But I guess that is what makes them so nice to receive  the simple fact that someone spent money on something that will only last a few days just to brighten your face for a moment. 
__label__label1 i think that the only reason college is as hard as everyone says it is is because they do not want to look dumb in front of other people. I came here thinking that I was in for it but all my classes seem not too difficult with a little bit of reading and work, but then again when people ask me how it is I can pretty much, no clearly see myself saying it is really hard you are in for it. I hate how, no I like the fact that my brother knows a million people no really by a million I mean a million but a cannot stand the fact that when I meet them for some reason after I am introduced by my name and then a relation of his people do this kind of weird double take and say oh YOU are his sister as if they have or had heard many of incidents and or events involving me it makes me a little uncomfortable more so with the males than the females though sometimes I think that the whole world does in fact revolve around the way people look (although when asked the whole world denies it) as if they do not judge or insinuate on the appearance of others I wonder what people think of me I have been told many of times that I fit the idealistic look of that of a rich snob, almost brat like appearance which is then reversed though my personality I would have never thought people would think of stuff like that about me I am highly, no I would say extremely satisfied with myself appearance, social class, and moralistic views though in the least conceited manner possible I do not understand sometimes the way males think though  especially after a few or more drinks I cannot wait until I can buy my elephant a real live circus if you will in my own back yard I am starting to think though that I might have to settle for an elephant shaped pool instead I have never really believed in love at first sight or that someone was "made" or "meant to be" for you you just find someone you can make it work with otherwise why do so many people get divorced and remarried multiple times before or ever finding the right person it irritates me that people think that you are interested in them in a relationship type of manner when you simply look at them, I look at everybody if the door opens I turn around and see who walked in I highly dislike immature people and seem not to understand why certain people are the way that they are I mean I know experiences and relationships have shaped their past but I have many faults in my past and have dealt with or lived with the one person I actually can say I hate I am the least bit negative though and am equally open to everyone that is introduced to my knowledge I like being open minded it enables people as well as myself to look at views and people in an entirely almost inhuman perspective I recently also noticed that nothing really stresses me out or makes me scared or nervous I never stress out why bother stressing about it which also wastes valuable time when the time can be using in a calm cool manner completing the task I just as similarly cannot think of anything that makes me nervous or scared I do not have a problem talking to extremely large audiences nor am I afraid of death I do not understand why people pass out bibles on campus either although I am not christian I went to a catholic school which helped me learn to respect other religions as well as traditions and practices so I cannot throw the bible away and I do not want to leave it anywhere because it is the word of someone else's supreme being 
__label__label0 Well, I have just come back from a ORGNAME meeting, an organization I never thought have joining since it is for future health professionals. But after I finished talking to one of their alumni advisors, it seems certain there is stuff for a business major like me. Plus, a friend of mine is an officer. The only problem I've encountered is the interaction among new people or strangers. While at the meeting, I kind of shied away from interaction with these people but I could go up to a few people. such as the officers, and start a conversation. This has been my tragic flaw my entire life. I have this shyness and this fear of new interaction. I am quiet guy and just do not have that calm easy going matter to break the ice well. Part of the fear is embarrassing myself I suppose. Yes, sometimes I have had the guts to start conversations with new people or call up a girl and be spontaneous. Then, do I become relaxed, however, this courage seems to only come with an individual or a rather small group of maybe 000 people. The problem comes when I have to be exposed to a huge amount of people. I just get nervous and it happens all the time, the confidence just seems to die. I can get a few bursts of courage, but after a while I just give up. I keep telling myself that I have to just stay calm and be confident, but this trait of mine still keeps to be holding me down. Sometimes I even become too quiet and shy with my friends which is sad. That is why I feel reluctant at times to go to parties because of that loss of confidence to mingle and the quietness that weighs me down. But that is why I am hoping to be more active in student organizations this year and see if I can work to build this confidence to thwart off this nervousness of interacting with people. I feel I can do it, and although I may still be naturally shy, I will at least feel more confident in these situations. 
__label__label0 What I feel is that I have disappointed myself so far this semester. I planned on being so much more organized than I actually am. I look around my room and my desk and get really annoyed at myself. I think I am missing something in terms of college academic life. I feel that I should be stressed and overwhelmed because those have been my feelings for the past couple of years. In high school, I was always trying to outdo myself and get more involved. By the time my senior year came around, I was so involved in clubs and classes that I was burnt out before 0st semester was even over. Every class I took was based on the recommended courses for LOCNAME. Every club I joined was so I could put several different activities on my application. Now that I am in college, I wonder if I am serious about my major, Theatre and Dance. Don't get me wrong, I love performing, and in an ideal world, I would become a regular on LOCNAME. But I always secondguess my goals and the reality of them actually coming true. I have performed literally since I could walk and talk. I haven't appeared on any major stages or on television, but performing has always been a really significant part of my life. It has shaped me into the person I am now. I just keep thinking. "is this really feasible or not. " It is one of the few things that I am good at and have been successful in. I suppose I went into the College of Fine Arts because fine arts are so familiar and comfortable for me. I actually thought of becoming a clinical psychologist or a social worker for the latter part of my high school life; I even took a semester of psychology last year. But I came to this conclusion: I have too many problems of my own that I can barely deal with, so how on earth could I solve anyone else's problems? The answer: I could not. I don't know. I guess I will get more into the routine as the weeks roll by. Hopefully, I will be successful at UT. Time can only tell. 
__label__label0 The first sensation I feel while beginning writing is the hard carpet of the dorms at dobie on my elbows because I'm lying on the ground with my laptop, but then again, at least the floors aren't wooden like the floors at the other dorms, so I really shouldn't be complaining. Also, my eyes are burning because I'm tired and want to go to sleep, I sleep a lot less in college because during the day there's constant noise and people and it's so much more fun to walk out in the hallway or go to the lobby and talk to people and see what's going on than to sit in my room and study, and since I don't study and do homework during the day I do it late at night when there are no distractions. If I stayed at Jester, I'd go to the library to get work done but I'm too lazy to walk from dobie to jester. This assignment is pretty easy and a whole lot better than sitting and doing my calculus homework which I have yet to do but I just looked at the clock on my laptop and it's only been 0 minutes since I've started and 00 seconds was when I got up to get a pillow to put under my elbows. My eyes are tearing now I don't know if tearing is a word, but they're getting watery from staring at this computer screen too long. I'm supposed to continue writing for 00 minutes straight and say what's on my mind and what I feel?? What if all I can think about is how I wish I was in bed, I think it's the music I'm listening to that's putting me to sleep. It's trance music, because that's what I have downloaded on my computer from ORGNAME, I hope they don't shut down napster. The courts are right about how the people who actually made the music (my roommate just called, I got all excited that my phone rang this late at night, I'm not a nerd, it's just that, I think it's this guy I know in okok back to napster) the people who make the music don't get their share and I understand and ORGNAME really should be shut down but I don't want it to because it's so nice to just type in the name of a song and there you have it, especially when they're old songs you haven't heard for a while. I love music, all kinds of music, it's the coolest feeling when a song brings back memories, or reminds you of people and events. It's 00:00 and I have to stop at 00:00, I hope I'm doing this assignment right because it's too fun,, it's kind of like a diary, maybe this could be our final??? Does the professor even read these essays that people write because I can't imagine reading 000 something essays about absolutely nothing even though those are the best kind, kind of like seinfeld a show about nothing that everybody loves. The music I'm listening to makes me think of illegal drugs, this is the kind of stuff people listen to when they're on ecstasy, it enhances the experience, I wonder why people need other things to have fun I understand it, but the world would be a better place if all the drugs were wiped off the face of the earth, but if that was going to happen, you might as well get rid of alcohol too, and nicotine and sugar and caffeine or anything that alters the mind, which is just ridiculous. Everything's here for a reason, I don't understand how people first invented and figured out stuff about drugs, I understand it when they grow out of the ground but stuff like pills, how were they invented did someone just put a lot of stuff together and try it and they found a combination that worked??? I'm scared for my younger sister, she's in the 0th grade, and there's so much going on now, with drugs and all, it's everywhere you go, and when she's my age, it will probably be so much worse, and so readily available, and curiosity is such a crazy thing, and no matter your willpower no matter what people always told you, you still want to try, and all the things we learn in elementary school about what to do and what not to do I think they bring in the whole forbidden fruit issue. I remember in 0th grade thinking "How can something be so powerful that it can make you do things you never would, and make you steal from friends, and make you feel so good that you would do anything to get it. I would try it, just once. " I can just imagine my little sister thinking like that. And you can't even shelter anyone anymore, because it's everywhere. You can't take her out of one school and put her in another, because it'll still be there, rich school or poor, minority or strictly white. It scares me to think about our generation in 00 years, because I can just see the damaged brains and the lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. Yuck I'm not even tired anymore because thinking about stuff like this gets me excited and ready to argue with someone. My twenty minutes are almost up and I could talk forever about what's on my mind, I always think about a lot of things which isn't really good because I can never fall asleep Ok that's 00, time for calculus  
__label__label1 I've been thinking and this "freshman fifteen" thing has to be an urban legend. I mean, really, I've never walked so much in my entire life. Everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so I figure, if I walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. Then I run errands and visit my friends and before I know it I've had an entire week's workout. And then when I have extra time I go to the gym and I know I'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. For instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. So I know I'm not the only one who walks, like 00 miles a day and still goes to the gym. But let's suppose I rode the Campus Loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would I gain weight? No because the Jester cafeteria is not somewhere I go for seconds. Of course the food isn't the worst I've ever eaten, but I'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. And on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. There is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. It's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. Cheese Pizza: 00 grams of fat; Hamburger Topping: 0 grams of fat. How can you ignore that? But I guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something I want to avoid. I am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 00 miles a day, and still go to them gym because Gosh Darn It! I will not gain the freshman fifteen. I will not. I won't let it happen. I will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. I can't do it. I won't do it. I will not gain the freshman fifteen. Besides, it's just an urban legend anyway. 
__label__label0 Well, unfortunately, I don't really like the way my mind works because it seems to churn in circles but never get anywhere. Some people can just lay back and absorb what's going on around them, but I seem to overanalyze everything that goes on Ð everything that's said to me, any gestures that people make towards me that could be insulting. They are all taken badly. I was dating this guy who got mad because I overanalyzed everything and he said, "Just do what I do and not think about it. " But people don't seem to understand what that means. It doesn't work to tell yourself "Stop thinking about it", because then you're thinking about it. I've talked to people about it numerous times and all they tell me is that I'm wasting away my life because I'm stressing about nothing and getting nowhere and that I need to do something about it because I'm not getting anywhere and I'm getting old fast. When people hear that I'm just starting college and stuff, they say they wish they were in my position, but I wish I was in their position. I wish I had no stupid problems like boys that don't pay attention and friends that get jealous. But even though I say I don't want it, I create drama for my life, and if there's nothing going on, I create problems. I don't really do it intentionally, but I've realized that if a relationship is going great, then I always do something that causes problems or I can't trust that nothing is wrong and so I start blaming people for things and saying they're lying to me. I recently got into (recently meaning more like about the last 0 years) this thing where I thought I needed psychological help and I talked to my parents about seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist, except that it wasn't really a constructive conversation. It was more like I said I was tired of running and getting nowhere and other things that make me mad, but they just sort laughed and said "Don't be silly. " The problem is that I didn't talk to them about anything that was going on, so they didn't know that there was any sort of problem. They thought that everything was perfectly normal and that I didn't really have any sort of problems. But I was looking in a book store for something about the psychology of love, just because it interests me, but instead I found something on the bargain shelf for 00 cents that was about dealing with minor psychological problems in yourself and others. But there's this problem that when I started reading the book, I thought I had all the problems in it. I started with something like OCD, and I related it to my life, and decided that's what my problem was, and then also with bipolar and definitely ADD. So I stopped reading it, because I would be doing something and get angry about it and then quote something from the book and my mom got so tired of it and said it was making problems for me and I should stop reading it. But it was so interesting to me. But I would be reading along and tears would come to my eyes because I would relate so much. Then I would run into some of the disorders I didn't know much about, and relate them too, like autism. So I came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me, and because of it, it was causing other problems, so that I had a combination of lots of things going on in my head. I don't know about all the other things, but I'm pretty much for sure that I have ADD. I did a research project on Ritalin for my senior paper, and that's when I really started getting interested in it. The problem is that my brain is either on or off. I can be completely focused and completely engrossed or I can be completely uninterested and not even know what someone's saying to me. The worst part is that it gets worse when I have PMS, for example, I worked at a restaurant and I went in one morning and was completely scatter brained and couldn't find anything and was just walking around in circles, and the manager said to me, "Wake up," and I got so upset, I thought it was such an insult and after work I went home and cried because I knew I would have to deal with that for the rest of my life. My mind sometimes just leaves my head, and I can't think or concentrate, even on what I'm saying. I'll be in the middle of a sentence and then just get tired of what I'm saying and just stop and say, "You know, whatever. " I meet someone and ask them their name, but then don't listen for the answer, so I never remember anyone's name and I forget things that have just happened, and I know that it's going to last forever, because my mom has it, my grandmother has it, and my cousin is the worst. My cousin was diagnosed with bipolar disease and she was on something, I think it was Prozac, and she had lots and lots of problems taking it. She's a lot better about taking it now, but when she doesn't, her "cluelessness" kicks in worse than ever. So I think the cluelessness is tied into something greater that's a problem with me. My parents are completely against medicine and think it's against Christianity, but I wish my whole family was on medicine. My brother and I both have anxiety attacks sometimes and my mom and dad are just crazy. My mom plays this nice, wonderful housewife that loves everyone and everything, but then she'll go crazy and do things like try and run away for a while and tell me that she almost threw everything from my floor out the window. It is completely like a scene out of the movie American Beauty. I've been brought up thinking that you can have your emotions and that you're entitled to your emotions, but they aren't a public thing. So I used to go into my room and just flip out and cry and fall to the ground and silently scream and they never knew anything was wrong. So when I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME last summer, I was completely messed up. I was living in a dorm with someone, because I was at a summer school kind of thing for art, and so I couldn't get away and cry; there were always people there. I would get my lunch and try to eat with everyone, but I would start to take the first bite and then just start crying because I wanted to go home. I called home all the time and said I thought if I stayed that I was going to die, and I really thought I was going to. well, unfortunately my 00 minutes is up, so I can't talk anymore, but I have about 0 more hours of things to say, if not three weeks. 
__label__label0     hehe. . wow you do have a timer on this page, I heard that you didn't, or that you could write for like 00min and then just hit submit and it would work, and I thought to myself   wow. . how hard would it be to make a script to auto submit it after 00minutes are up    Its really lame tho that you didn't give us some sorta topic to start out on, I mean, I find it easier to conciously recognize my thoughts when they are focused on a general topic. That prolly doenst make alot of sence, but basically I'm a big person into mind over matter stuff, metaphysics, multideminsional self, acension, and usually and am in close contact with my thoughts, but usually when in a trance state or meditation, not while acually creating kenetic energy(moving physcially). I'm listening to my speakers right now. . I love tool's music, its so euphoric and conductive to a meditative state. sorta like how trance music sorta makes you tired after listening to it for 00 min or so. Yeah, now you prolly think something about trance == drugs or something. But no. I don't drink, do drugs, I'm a vegetarian, and like to keep my body in a good state. Wow my computer case is dirty. I need to get a towel or something and clean it off. I wish I had a new motherboard/processor and more ram for it too. Which reminds me I need to build a linux server soon. . I've got the parts just not the time becaues I'm too busy writing programs for my cs classes. Taking 00 hours is ok. wish I had more. . like 0-0 more. it keeps me busy, which I like. I want to do research in metaphysics. Isn't weird a cs/math double major wanting to do research in the area of metaphysics which has no real basis physically?  I got a good base in logic tho which really helps. My gf is coming up here this weekend, from dallas. Shes' at NT right now cause shes in tams and I miss her, it'll be fun. oww my hand hurts from typing or something. I like being able to close my eyes and just type it makes it easier to concentrate on my thoughts. I still taste the cheese on my tounge. I had cheese and crackers earlier and it was good. thirsty. . yay tea  I like my cell phone, I saw my cell and it made me think that. unlimited night/weekend is awesome. Music:   duh duh duh duh   end song move to bad religon. . ehh. . I guess it can sit there for now. hmm. . been 00min so far. about half done. I like this tho. well not so much the writing for stream of concouisness but the premiss behind it. analizing thoughts see what people are like and stuff. . its nice. thinking I would do a triple major in pphilosophy if I can get a job to pay for my classes that go over 000 hours. wow there is a big purple mark on my arm where I rest in on the edge of my   desk:    its not a real desk, more a shelf in my aparment designed to act as a desk. I like my apartment so much better than dorms,  room by myself, and cheaper. Got housemates tho. but its still better. I wonder what tristan is doing at college station (old roomate). I've lacked seeing him online. music  resist and multiply   . . thats incubus. there ok but latest album is the worst they've done. grr I need to do more streching, I've lost my flexiblity, and I need to work out more,  just got to make myself move awayt from my phone and just surfing online when nothing better to do. they have a gytm over here in my apartments. wonder where it is. I need to find out. mainly want to work on abs pecs and left trapiezius all but pecs aI can do here in my room with my dumbbell so not that big a rush  &lt;moving to music&gt;  &lt;singing in head to redhot chili pepper&gt; I like my speaker system. sound card and speakers where bout 00 total which is nice for how they work. . not top of the line but better than anything else I prolly could of got for the same. hmm. . my joints in my fingers like to pop, and my knees sometime. I'm siting weird, or what most people would consider weird. basically enjoying my flexibitliy and light weight so that I can stay in strange positions and be comfortable. I usta sleep in class in weird positions. . I had to fight to stay up in logic this morning. but I made it. . so yay. I watn a 0. 0 this sem so staying up is all good. I shoudl be able to cause I'm working harder than any time before. . hmm. . its ddone now. . bye bye 
__label__label0      I'm really not sure what exactly I am suppossed to write about so I thought I would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's September 00th. That morning I woke up and things didn't seem any different. I put on my I love LOCNAME LOCNAME shirt and went to class. Truthfully, I was very dissapointed with the people here at ORGNAME and how they acted that day. People in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. The tower played LOCNAMEn Songs for about 00 minutes and they were really mad about it. It was   getting in the way of our discussion.   WHATEVER!!  We should have been discussing September 00!!  One girl in the class said,   Who cares!!  People die every day!!  We kill people in LOCNAME every day and we don't hold memorials for them!!    I personally was outraged by that comment. How disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. That night I went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. We stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. It was awesome. To be standing there next to my friends, people that I loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. To hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. And then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. The whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. It was very powerful. You couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in LOCNAME LOCNAME who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but WANTING to go in anyways. I had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. Walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. And in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. At the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. I forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. In almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. You couldn't help it. Then the whole crowd sang God Bless LOCNAME. Hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing GOD BLESS AMERICA was absolutely amazing. I knelt down where I was and said a prayer to thank God for my family and my friends and for the fact that was SO blessed. I picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that I love her. My family is the most important thing in the world to me and if I lost any of them I don't know how I could even go on. When it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. It made me think about the pictures I had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. A very powerful sight. The man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in LOCNAME LOCNAME on December 0th. That was an amazing thought to me also. It was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great LOCNAMEn tragedy. However, this was a tragedy but not just that. In fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. I saw a commericial that gave me the chills. It was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking American city. The voice in the background said   On September 00, 0000, terrorists tried to change America forever.   The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 0 or 0 american flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. The voice said   They succeeded.   I think that is a perfect way to say what September 00 has done for America. Yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in LOCNAME are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. At this point in my life, I am VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. 
__label__label0      The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   
__label__label1    Today is September 00, the day before our new monumental rememberence day ORGNAME September 00th. I sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the LOCNAME LOCNAME. It is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we can't do anything about it. I still remember like it was yesterday watching the September 00th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow.        Now that I am a freshman at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME things are beginging to change. For instance, my boyfriend and I are on a   break  , whatever that means. He doesn't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out. He's a junior at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and has done the whole new college experience already. It is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer. I think it is that I really want to go out and meet new people. Getting to know the girls at my dorm in Kinsolving is really fun, and I like hanging out with them on the weekends. Of course this means going to parties with other boys there, and this doesn't make my boyfriend very happy. I can totally understand because I wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party, but I have to do the whole college experience right?  Well anyway now that we are broken up, I realize how much I miss him and how much I don't want to end things. It's weird how when it's time to go to sleep or study that is all I can think about. He's so cute and perfect, I don't know what I am screwing up. It's hard trying to balance your time here now that I am in college. There is always something to do, and I love that, but I need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track. I guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult, and deadlines were not so final, as long as you could persuade the teacher. College is a blast and I love my roomate. She went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME. She still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could. So then she made the right choice and came to LOCNAME and we ended up rooming together. It's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 0 in the morning to 0 in the morning. I really need to go to the gym today also because I don't want to gain the freshman 00, I reallly don't want to go back home to LOCNAME LOCNAME looking like a heffer!  So anyway I think I might go run after I finish writing. Another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here. She got in to the summer LOCNAME program but decided to go to ORGNAME instead. I miss her so much, we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close. OUr boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time. Me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up, so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly. Except now we're having problems and we're in the same town. My friend and her boyfriend are 0 hours away and doing great, funny how that works. One good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty. I love the hills and trees. OUtside my dorm room window is hills and churches. Yes, it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home. Another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 00 goes to ORGNAME so is only like 00 minutes away from me. We have always been so close and I miss her lots. I went down on Laybor day with 0 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters. It was really fun and I got to spend time with her. My mom is sad that I left for college, she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college. I really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind. All of my friends were leaving for school and I really didnt wnat to be the only one at home. I am one out of four kids at home. MY older sister is already off at ORGNAME, but then I have a 00 year old brother and a 00 year old sister. I don't think it is the same at home without me. My mom and I  are really close, and I talk to her almost everyday. She said it's very quiet without me at home, I guess I was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around. Even though not being at home is very weird, I love college. The freedom you have is great. I know that I have to concentrate on my classes lots because I want to get into the communications school here at UT&gt; 
__label__label1 Hi my name is jennifer doolan. . i am writing because i was told to for an assignment. i am not sure what i am thinking exactly.

I need to work out but it is too late and i am lazy. . oh well Homecoming is in like 00 days and i have to go home. . it is a tradition for the old officers to go back and sit with the drillt eam and watch and stuff but i need to lose weight so that they are not like oh my god what happened to her. . and i need to go shoping for an outfit to wear. . i am not sure what i want though. . maybe i want a skirt or something austinish or maybe clasical would be better. . who knows who cares really . . they are all still in highschool and if they did not like me then they are not goig to like me now and i do nto really care either way. I am ready to go see my mom and my don. . i miss htem very much i feel like i am missing my nieces grow up by being so far away from them. I knwo that they willbe fine but i miss seeing htem everyday likei use to . floppy disks are weird they are colorful but silly if you think about it. who knows i might want to be a computer science major but i donto know what job opportunities that holds. . i am going for being a laywer at the present moment because there are job opportunities everywhere and you do not have to live in once certian place. I could also be a teacher my sister teaches 0st grade she is so cute. I called her tonight and she seemed really suprised to talkto me. . it is not like i am in africa or something just in austin a phone call away. cell phones i hate cell phones well i love them but hty are a pain i wish that all minutes were free and you could tlak to whoever whenever you wanted. all of mymin are for use after 0 well i have 000 daytime min and 0000 night and weekend so i have to talka fter 0 but what if i want to tlak before then, i guess i am out of luck. the first of the summer i talked way to much on mine and my mom got mad at me so i had to cut back. i really hate it when people are mad at me it makes me sad and i have to fix it right away or i am unhappy. . well my time is almost up and i am going to go to bed now 
__label__label1      ok. i don't know waht to type right now. im listening to alanis morissette right now and the song is about whether she is good enough for anything. sometimes i feel kind of like this; like im not good enough to do anything. now im stumped again as to waht to write. i talked to my best friend PROPNAME yesterday and she is back home now. she went to taiwan for the summer to do an internship. then she went to LOCNAME to ride a bus back to round rock. but she kept missing the bus back so she ended up staying in california. im really excited that she came back. i havent seen her in like four months and i didnt get to see her off when she left. i was really sad. sometimes i miss having a best friend here. kelly is my best friend in all but she has her schedule and family problems and a lot of times i just miss having a best friend to do everythign with. haley, one of my other friends used to do a lot with me. . almost everything. but this summer she got a job and her dad got a raise so now that she has more money, it seems like she is too good for me. i don't like people like that. there is someone at our room door. haley and i were suppost to go to breakfast one morning and had planned it all out. but then the morning of the event, she had one of her other friends, jennifer, call me and tell me haley couldnt make it because of a doctors appoinment. i was like, why can't haley call me herself. then she tries to play it all off. i don't really have anything to say to her now. i havent seen her on campus since classes started and weve only talked online about two or three times. thats not much compared to how much we used to talk. twenty minutes is a long time to continuously type. i guess its not too bad for people who type slow but for those who type kind of fast, this just makes for a lot of nonsense talking/ typing. ok. this semester im taking karate/ tae kwon doe. its really fun but a lot of work. i signed up for the class because i thought it wouldnt require too much work - aside from the work out - but actually this class has books and i have a three to five page paper due in it. its the only class i have a paper due in this semester. how odd is that?. oh well, it should be fun either way. this alanis morissette music is some really angry music. 
__label__label1    Well for some reason I am stressing out about everything that is going on in the first few weeks of school! Not only are classes overwhelming and so much different than high school because of number of students in each class, but I am in a whole new city! For the first time I am away from my family trying to make my own choices, doing my own laundry, making my own food, and trying to make new friends. I am scared about being able to study too! And I am scared about failing. I also just went through PROPNAME and I am in a sorority which is also very overwhelming. We just had a meeting and we have to keep a certain ORGNAME, finish many hours of volunteer work and stay at the house for at least 00 hours a week to study there. We also have mixers twice a week at night. I don't know how I ma going to manage all of these things at once. I am also stressing about finding where to live next year. I had a deposit down for an apartment with a girl I met during the summer, but the more I got to know her, the more I knew I couldnt live with her. So now I am trying to find a group of nice girls and find a place to live before they are all taken. Not to mention my ex boyfriend is here and things between us are very complicated. I wish he could communicate with me and tell me how he really feels because I am tired of playing all these stupid games! We keep trying to make each other jealous, but I really care about him alot. OHHH and I am getting sooooooo fat! I swear our older sorority sisters want to keep giving us cookies, cake, and candy to make us fatter! I don't have time to excercise. But I really love it here and I know I am going to have so much fun! I have already met several awesome girls that are so fun to hang out with. And since I came from a small baptist schoool its interesting to meet so many different kinds of people. I love how ORGNAME is so diverse. I love my roommate too. I went pot luck and was kind of nervous about that but we are perfectly matched. We are both neat freaks and have the same personality. I hope we become great friends, so far we have talked about everything. She is really smart too. I miss my best friends from high school. Two of them went to ORGNAME, I was baout to go there with them but I loved UT. It was a hard choice to make though. The only person I really knew here were a few older girls that went to my high school and my ex boyfriend. . who is frustrating me! I couldnt sleep at all last night because I was upset with him! I miss my mom and my family too. Even my dog. I don't know when I will go home. . it seems like there is so much to do here. OHH I really want to see the movie Swim fan and Sweet Home LOCNAME. I bet I won't have time to see movies here and I don't have the money either! My money is all gone! I have no clue where it went, I never get to go shopping here. I also need to find a church to go to, just to keep me grounded. Its kind of hard to focus here. But I am really happy about the sorority I am in. It was such an emotionally draining process, so many girls where heartbroken. But I just hope that there isnt a stereotype against sororities because each girl I have met has been truly kind and helpful and its such a great way to meet people and do stuff for the community too. I am going to the childrens hospital tommorrow morning to visit the children there. I am really excited about that. I love kids. I think I want to be a teacher, I just hope I have the patience for it and that I make it through college! Its so weird to think I am in college right now trying to get a degree! I still feel like a little kid sometimes. Hopefully I will be able to focus and get settled down and figue out my priorities!

__label__label1 Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 0:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 00 minutes. i wonder why 00 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 000 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, PROPNAME's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult. 
__label__label1      Okay. . now what? I thought I new what to write about, but not too sure anymore. I am doing this right now instead of studying because I forgot my books at home to study from. I am really trying hard not to waste time time semester, so it upset me a little when I forgot my book. My feet are cold right now. I should of worn tennis shoes. I want to work out later, but I think I should study to get on top of things. I need to get caught up at least, if not ahead. I am going to LOCNAME with my sister in three weeks and have two exams the next two days I get back. It would be really really nice not to have to worry about school when I am on vacation. I didn't really have much of a vacation this summer. I had a good internship with ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I have a returning offer next summer, but don't know if I really want to take it. I guess I should because it is a good opportunity and can have big rewards when I graduate. I need to talk to my counslor about my degree plan. I just changed my major from Engineering Route to ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I still don't know if this new major is right for me, but it seems like the one that fits the best right now. Speaking of Finance, I have Finance homework to do tonight. My stomache is growling right now. I don't know if I should get a little bite to eat right now before my 0:00 class, or if I should wait until I get home and not spend any money. It's hard to see that distinction with me because I do not work for my money (my parents have always helped me out) and therefore I think that deep down I don't know the real value. Sure I have had jobs, but it was never for survival, just for extra cash or for the experience. Thinking back, I have had several jobs, ranging from Pizza girl, to lifeguard, to clerk, etc. I really don't know why I started working so early. I started my first job when I was 00. It almost seems not right because my parents always supported me, they didn't even want me to work!  None of my jobs, however, lasted very long. I think that was due to my schedule when I was younger. I was so involved in sports. Sports, sports, sports. Sometimes I wonder what would have happended if I would have pursued soccer. I could have played in college. One thing is for sure, I would definitely be physically fit like I used to be. Now I struggle to keep my weight down, not that I am overweight, but it is just not easy like it used to be. I used to eat everything and anything, junkfood that is. I never ate healthy food when I was younger and that is one of my problems now. If I like salad and vegetables, I would eat them all the time because they are healthy. But I love bad food too much. Like pizza, hotdogs, and fries!!  Okay, maybe I will get a little bit to eat after this. Nine minutes left and now my fingers are freezing. This used to happen to me when I am was at work, typing alot. I guess the blood doesn't circulate too much to the tips of your hands when you are typing. Maybe I am just making that up. I wonder if I should have tried to add drop before it was too late. I think I like my Tues/Thursday schedule because I get out at 00, even if I have to start at 0am. Early classes aren't so bad as long as you get a good nights rest. Which I didn't do last night. I stayed up late because I knew I didn't have to wake up until 00. My first class today is at 00:00, then my next one is at 0:00, that's Psychology. I guess it's a tradeoff. I have late classes on Monday and Wednesday, but that leaves my Fridays free. Hopefully on Fridays I can get alot of stuff done that I didn't get to during the week. I can't imagine how this semester is going to play out. Being an officer in a huge organization on campus has its work cut out for you. I figured that yesterday I spent at least four hours working on HBSA stuff (ORGNAME Business ORGNAME ORGNAME). I guess that sounds about right. Nine officers trying to run an organization that almost 000 memebers take part in. When I was running for my position last spring, I was thinking that maybe I could run and be President my Senior year. Now I am not too sure I would want to pursue that. I think I would like to take it easy. Just concentrate on school and not worry about the   hustle and bustle   of everyday life. (The words in the quotes is the name of a painting that I learned about in a class that I had with my boyfriend this last semester. )  Those were fun times. Going to class with him and going home after that. I wish he was here again, but he had to go start his life in the real world, which did not include LOCNAME. Austin. . . . . . . . that is where my life is now. I can't imagine going and living in LOCNAME LOCNAME again. Mayb ethat is why  
__label__label0 Twenty minutes is a very long to\ime to just be typing about nothing. I don't know that I can come up with anything to write about. I really should be studying for spanish becausse that class is a lot harder but I guess I don't have to do it right now. Tomorrow is Tuesday so I don't even have to do this now but I guess it will be one less thing to do later. Somebody is moving furntiture next door and it sounds like guy's voices. This is an all girl dorm so they are breaking a rule. No boys in the dorm!!  That's a funny rule- like it really keeps people from doing stuff they shouldn't. Wow two minutes already! I guess it is going a little faster that I thought it would. I'm really tired - I need to sleep more. At least my room is really clean. My fish is staring at me. His name is Moby like from the book. I don't even know what the book is about-isn't that retarded that I am in college and never read moby dick?   Our educations system today. . I need to get deej a b-day gift soon- I think her b-day is on thursday. Shes getting up there in age really fast. I wonder what my mom is doing right now. She is off today because it's labor day. I feel like I have a lot to do but I guess I really don't. This week should go super fast I'm hoping. I need to do Math homework too that is really important. PROPNAME should be back ssoon. I wonder how I'm going to talk to her and keep typing at the same time. I wonder what all this means. I bett this stupid computer is going to tell me some deep psychological thing about myself after this is done although I have discussed nothing profound. I'm tired of typing. I could go a head and stop and just let the timer keep going but that would be cheating and you probabably know that.  I need good grades. This is so boring my eyes are drooping!!  I want sleep on my nicne new soft bed. I bet my mom spent SO much money on that bed. I have to do my defensive driving thing soon before I get halled off to jail. I don't know when I'm going to find time for that. I need a job. Their were so many cute clothes at the mall today. I need to shop but I don't want to spend money. I'm cheap. Oh, well. I'm really worried about my cell phone bill. Maybe the verizon webpage will tell me some stuff. Man I'm not even halfway through with this assignment. I wonder what the purpose is. I'm really tired and I'm falling  asleep right now. Ahhh!   Hurry up!  I don't want to do this anymore. I wonder what people do who can't really type. Our refrigerator is really noisy. I think it would be funny ot read someone elses thing. this is going to be REALLY long Sorry, I need a drink on pepsi. I had to take a breather. I wonder if those reabate things really get you money back. I'm glad that I'm going to know my course load down to only 00 hours. 00 is really to many. Modern will be relatively easy and I  m thinking I can do well in this class if I really try hard. I wonder if I could get a job at one of the hospitals or something. I really need to call Aunt PROPNAME tonight. I sjhould make that a priority. I need to also find out information about the dance stuff  I want to do. I will have to diet this week. Yuck!  I am bored bored bored. My room is really cute now. I like my fish and picutes and the colors. I musht admit that it is way cute. I have so many picutes. I like the ledge along my wall- that hlp a lot. I want to decorate my bublletin board too. Maybe I can get some stuff this weekend. We need a full length mirror for out room. We need it really baddly too. they do really crappy paint jobs in here. It looks terrible!!  the can't evin keep it on the wall. My desk looks brand new though. It is really cold in there- I don't like it. My fish is staring at me. I think he thinks I'm and idiot. I fed him today but maybe a little too much. I know you can over feeed them. I'd love to get more but I think they kill eachother. Myabe I could get a female and they could breed fish. That would be really cute. I could sell the babies for 0 bucks a piece. Yeah!! I'm almost done. My lege hurts- maybe I have shin splints. I have been running so much latly. I need to go tonight. I should have read the part of the book that corresponds with this lesson so that I would know what all this means and WHY we actually have to type for so long. ONly one more minute left. PROPNAME isn't back yet. Oh hurry up I want to be DONE. My fingsrs are numb it is so cold in this room. I want my bed now!! only a couple more seconds and I will be done with this assighnment. I hope I like this class! 
__label__label0      Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask PROPNAME to go with me. I also need to call PROPNAME. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 0 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 00. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask PROPNAME today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with PROPNAME PROPNAME right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and PROPNAME never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew PROPNAME PROPNAME would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and PROPNAME comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home. 
__label__label1  yes, here i am, finally. I never thought i would be doing this, ever. This is so weird. it's so weird, whenever i'm under any type ofpressure, i can never type well. it's so weird. but it's probably pretty common. everyone gets underpressure. i hate it thoguh. because i never feel like i'm  a good typist. i never was though. even when first started learning in 0th grade. i was always the last one to finish my lines, or whatever. 0th grade. that was so long ago. i was just thinking about that the other day. i remember that was a grade of so many changes. i just realized that i'm very nostalgic. i constantly look back on my past. maybe that's becasue i was sexually abused as a child. it's weird. i just read a quote a couple of weeks ago that said   life can can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.  That's so true. because i believe that everything in anyone's life, the way they are, their personality, their mannerisms, their characteristics, everything- stems from childhood. if someone is abused as a child, they will either become an abuser themself, or even worse, a serial killer, or they will spend the rest of their life dealing with it as best they can, praying to god that it will never happen again to them, or anyone else they love. that's me, i think. i'm obviously not going to abuse myslef, nor bacome a serial killer. i don't think. haha. no, i'm just kidding. don't worry, it's weird how one's thoughts wander, isnt it? i could never picture myself being a serial killer. i just hate dead bodies. they make me have nightmares. well, not really. but after i saw that movie, seven. . oh my gosh. i think my brain even squirmed. it was a good plot, though. i will admit that. that's another thing. you know how people criticize people like eminem and marilyn manson, and other outreagous people in the media? sometimes they can't help their success. sometimes they are just stopped on the street, and some exec says, hey i wnat to make money off of your emotions. and that's just what they do. they make huge names out of these people just so they can money, and then the stars themslves are happy because they can express themselves and they make money. so tehir success is just plain luck ,a lot of the time. so you can't always blame those peolpe for their success. blame the people that signed them. . okay, my 00 min are up, so i'm going to go now. wow, this was very theraputic , in a way. i'm goi g to make chicken parmesan tonight!! yum!!     
__label__label0      Right now I am listening to a great song. It is a song by PROPNAME PROPNAME called HUrrincane. I really like and it is a true story. PROPNAME PROPNAME is probably my favorite artist of all time. He is an amazing songwriter. And i love how he can play harmonica and guitar at the same time. I realize other people can probably do this but I just love to listen to PROPNAME PROPNAME. In this song Hurricane he tells the story of a boxer named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is framed for a crime he did not commit. His lyrics are really great because he plays with his rhyming and his rythm changes a lot too. I have seen PROPNAME PROPNAME perform in three different cities. The best one was in LOCNAME. I think LOCNAME is just a great city in general. That is one of the main reasons I wanted to go to ORGNAME. I really liked the idea of living in LOCNAME. And now that I am here it is working out really well. The school is huge but it is a very friendly, very beautiful campus. I am always surprised by how many people I run into in the course of a day. Sometimes I hadnt even known that the person went to Ut or even that they were in LOCNAME. Yesterday when I was eating I saw a guy that I had no seen since eighth grade. He recognized me right away and said his name so that I would remember him. It was amazing that he recognized me froms so long ago. I thought that was really cool. And I love UT because there are so many interesting classes to take. I never thought I would be able to take a whole class devoted to classical mythology. I have learned a little about mythology in other classes but now I have a whole class for it. It is really fun to read about all the deities and gods and demigods in different types of myths. My roommate right now has a sociology class about juvenile delinquency. I think that is also very interesting. She is reading her textbook right now. My roommate is cool. I got very lucky with the pot luck assignment. Shes from LOCNAME LOCNAME and her mom is a judge. Yesterday I met her mom and she is very nice too. She took us out to a really great Chinese restaraunt. It was one of my first non Jester meals since I've been here. I don't mind the food at Jester. Some people complain that Jester is gross but I really like it. The people on my floor are very friendly. Two girls across the hall always come over and hang out with us and its a lot of fun. I have lots of distractions from studying though so I have to be sure to try and concentrate and actually get my work done. There is just so much to do here. Tonight I am probably going to go to hear a singer play named PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is playing at LOCNAME. I have never been there but my brother tells me that it is cool. It is fun having an older brother go to the same school as you. He looks out for me. I sat with him at the footbasll gamme and it was really fun. I even got to go out on the field during halftime to help form the tunnel for the players. My very first UT game was a big success. The second half was very uneventful but overall I had a really good time. I don't usually watch a lot of football but I am excited about going to support the UT team. I even watched a girls soccer game the day after that. We beat ORGNAME 0-0. It was pretty fun to watch. I love to play soccer but I have not been on an organized team since my freshman year. In high school I mainly played softball. But now that I am at UT I don't play that anymore. I am going to sign up for intra mural volleyball and possibly flag football. My roommate and I are going to try to be on the same team. It should be a lot of fun. It is coed so we got some guys to join our team from down the hall. When I was in eighth grade I played volleyball and I was a setter. I think that will be my job on this team as well. My favorite sport to watch is baseball. I like to follow the ORGNAME ORGNAME. My dad is a big fan so he has had season tickets to the ORGNAME games for years. Now that there is a new stadium, our seats are really good. We sit right behind home plate and it is a great view of the game. Last time I watched one the ORGNAME won. They have changed a lot of stuff about ORGNAME baseball. They used to have cool rainbow uniforms and an alien guy for a mascot. But now the colors are navy blue and red or something like that. ANd the mascot is just some bunny thing. I like the old, vintage uniforms better. I wish I still had my old ORGNAME tshirts because it is very hard to find that stuff now. I had a big poster of Orbit the old mascot. 
__label__label1    I thinkIdon't know what towritebutby thinking that i actually have womethingtowrite. in is hot and i am hungry. The lights on the computer keyboard are bright. I wish i could type faster so that I could keep up with my thoughts. oh how am i ever going to type for twenty minutes straight.

WHy is the TV on ORGNAME all theat is on it is the stocks going across the bottom. why does the gateway box have a cow pattern on it. I wonder where that business card is from. I might watch a beautiful mind tonight i see the dvd case beside me. oh i am getting tired of doing this. My backspace key is the most used key on my computer. I can't typew very well so i am using this time to practice on my typing as well as doing my homework. the mouse pad is from centuryinter. net and century telephone. i wonder how many staples can fit in that stapler. my neck is starting to hurt it feels better now since i popped it. i wonder why people like leather so much. my knee is hurting. thereis some sort of law exam book beside me of the desk. i wonder what that wooden block over there is used for it lokks like some sort of picture frame or maby a name plaque. oh i am tired good i only have 0. 0 minutes left to type. i wonder if chris is going to call me and let me know if his business is going yet.

__label__label0 I have been feeling so different when I arrived here at LOCNAME. I just can't believe that I graduated from high school and now here at college. The atmosphere is different here. I feel like I belong here. When I first arrived here at LOCNAME,I was scared. I was afraid about how am I going to get from class to class. ItLOCNAME just different here. I'm worried about the exams. There's only 0 exams per class. I'm not used to that. I guess I'm used to spoon feeding from high school. LOCNAME is just soooooo huge. I didn't know that ORGNAME was this big after orientation. I'm just afraid of my classes. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail. I feel like I'm slacking off. I do my homework and read, but I still feel like I'm failing. I guess I have high standards for myself. I want to score the best that I can get. I'm just afraid that I'm going to drop out of LOCNAME. As long as I push myself to stay on top of things then I'll be ok. After the   Gone to LOCNAME  , I feel like I choose the right college. I definitely felt like fit in. My major is Nursing. I kind of lost in finding a major. When I was a kid, you would dream about what you wanted to be. I always said that I wanted to be a doctor. Now, when I think about my future I don't know what I want to be. I volunteered in a hospital and I notice that the nurses are so nice to they're patients. I want to be one of those. I want to be the one who helps out and put a smile on the patients. I want to work with children. After nursing school, I want to become a nurse practitioner. It's just like a register nurse but higher. A nurse practitioner gets to prescribe medication. That's almost like a doctor. Everybody is like   why don't you want to be a doctor?   I'm afraid of malpractice suits. I'm just  My dream is to work at the LOCNAME LOCNAME's LOCNAME in LOCNAME. It's close to home and I like working with kids. They are so much fun. I just hope that I can make it through school. College life is just so different. I miss my parents and my brother. I went back home during the Labor Day weekend. I miss my mom's home cooking. What's weird is that when I left college, my parents got a little puppy.      
__label__label1      my mom is so silly or mabey it is th eway I say them she just gets things wrong. But I love her and dad and sister they just anoy me. She tells me too much info and I get kind of too rude.

The board is gettin g hard to touch I can not believe the time went by soooo fast call mom 
__label__label0      As soon as I am done with this I plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. I don't really feel much like working. My biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. My telephone just rang. My air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that I have heard. Right now I am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. We ate at ORGNAME's and the food was salty. I wish I was in a cold swimming pool right now. This weekend was fun. We went swimming in the lake. College is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. I dont' miss them terribly, but I just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. Classes have not been that hard these first several days, and I am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. Now I seem to have nothing on my mind. I am just staring at the computer screen. All I really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. My neck is still a little sore. I will take some aspirin later. I will check my mailbox later today. My bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. Now I am not really thinking of much. I feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before I head out of my room. In fact, right when I am finished writing this I am going to lay on my bed. I am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. Only about 00 days until Christmas break. 
__label__label0 what am i thinking? that is quesiton i sometimes ask myself when i'm things that are out of this world. thinking, to put the mind to work and have conversations in your head about whatever is on your mind at that moment or to ponder over a serious of questions or question such as this one. right, now i'm thinking of what to write, and as always not being able to think of anything worth writing. its not my thing to write out of the blue without having prethought what i was going to write. I'm sitting in front of my computer, cold and tired from a very long day. my dorm room is always to cold so i have to sit here shivering while i type. the cold may be affecting my train of thought since i'm preoccupied in thinking how i'm going to keep warm after this is over. i should have put on a sweater but for some reason i let myself remain cold and keep complaining about it. it's my fault really,i should just get up and put on a sweater or wrap a blaket around me. what stops me from doing it, i don't know. it could be because i have to stay here for twenty minutes typing or because i'm to lazy to actually get up and search for something warmer, or it could be because it won't be long after i put in on that i will have to take it off to go to sleep. i never found it comfortable to sleep with a sweater on, except of course in the extreme cases like when i used to go camping out in the mountains in the middle of january. i like camping, its the one thing that i love to hate and vice versa. during the day it nice to going hiking and stuff but during the night it can be horrible having to take a bath in the freezing cold and make dinner by fire and lamplight, not to mention the cold hard ground and the paper thin tents that are suppose to protect us from the 00 degree weather. i'm don't really like the cold but then again when its a hundred degrees outside i wish winter would come. people in general are never content with the weather. its either to hot or to cold,like food almost. we blow on soup to cool it down and hold ice cream in our mouths till it melts before swallowing it. my radio is on and so is the tv which has nothing to do with anything but we are suppose to write continuously for twenty minutes, so i thought i'd write that. its relaxing to be listenting to the radio, cause even when i'm down there's alway a song to cheer me up. right now i'm relaxed happy to be ahead in my reading but aware of a test i will have to take this friday. people always have the ablity to walk in at the wrong times. someone just knocked on the door and i shouted to them to come in and in seeing me at work they left but they did disrupt me which of course is always inviting except when i have to do something where i can't be interrupted like this timed writing. in 00 seconds, never mind i'm done. 
__label__label1      Boredom, music, bump my air conditioner makes a really funny sound the whole time. so glad my parents got me in the castillian. dip, dip cup, i hope someone drinks out of the dip cup someday.

Laundry, man i miss my mom. dip, spit. dip cup. loud noise in the hall now, this place is never quiet, my schedule is so great! library science is such an easy class, 0 mins! thats it? i feel like i have been typing forever.

PROPNAME, best flood ever. so much fun, i miss my old friends back home, its like a whole new thing here, its so different. i miss jimmys garage, security, so much better than here. Castillian is great, the cops in fwood. jeez i hated the cops in friendswood, i can't believe they would just walk in so many times. im glad i left because of that, i wonder if they will still remember all of us when we come back. money, man my parents are great, tropical storm. I hope it isnt so bad, my house doesnt normally flood, i doubt it will, coby is home, bitching about class, thats funny. he didnt know where his class was, hes talkin to nick, why are they still watching the weather channel. their room is so messy, i wonder if grammar and spelling and punctuation counts on this assignment, i hope not. i wonder if this all makes sense. dip, spit. repetition, i wonder what that means, sixteen minutes, wonder why i spelled sixteen that time, i am not very good at typing on this keyboard, i miss my old keyboard back at home. I miss home a lot, i miss having the upstairs all to myself, i wonder what my sisters are doin right now. coby is looking for me. they are still watching weather channel. just read allison at the top of this, best flood ever. I can't believe chad wussed out and wouldnt swim down the street with us, I wonder how mike is doin, i hope he does well in football, I wonder what virginia is like, i wonder what it would be like to go to school all by yourself, im glad i don't have to. should i proofread this? i don't think  i will have time, 00 minutes. found the numbers that time. two more minutes, jeez i typed so much in such a short time, this felt like no time at all. dip, spit. whit, sarah. oh jeez, what trouble is that going to get me in. all that trouble is back home. last night, laundry, talkin on the phone, worst conversation ever. i can't believe i said some of that stuff, i wonder what susan is doin tonight, i hope we can go party with her and her sorority, i hope we show those girls a good time tonight. someone is lookin at away messages, we are all so addicted to instant messenger. everyone is, its horrible. nick mustve had a funny away message, people sent him  a bunch of messages, i should change mine. what is that music, some theme song?  
__label__label0      I'm tired. I wish I did'nt have an 0 a. m. class everyPROPNAMEy. I have so much stuff to do and i forgot again to call regarding to job to apply for. My boyfriends coming on Friday and thats all i can really think about. It feels like I'm not really thinking about anything. Maybe I should not have tried to do this so early in the morning. Oh well. It is too dark in my room now and I really want to turn on the lights but my roomate is asleep. Wow twenty minutes is a really long time. Who knew? PROPNAME da PROPNAME. I'm bored. I really want to go do something active like outside but the weather is too bad. I hate when it rains. It puts me in a bad mood. It's actually cold in my room today maybe they fixed the air conditioning. I'm thinking about how i feel like i really don't have anything to say in this. I think my mind is like dead right now but maybe that's the point. I need to go take a shower, and do my homework for Economics and Ancient LOCNAME. I wish I could be sleeping like PROPNAME but no I'm awake writing this. I need to repaint my toenails. They're all chipped. No one wants to see that. Maybe I will do that after I finish this assignment. I miss PROPNAME. It's crazy how we have only been apart two weeks and I am so incapable of being by myself. I need to make some more friends here in LOCNAME. I do not want to only rely on my boyfriend for support. What if something happens? Agghh. Why do I say stuff like that. I miss my family and I miss how things were. I don't know if I'm ready for this whole college thing but I guess, maybe more I hope, that a lot of other people feel the same way. Everyone just seems so adjusted to the whole change. Why am I saying all this stuff for this assignment? I wonder why I keep looking at that tissue box? Seriously, I have like stared at it the whole time I have done this. I wonder if you all read these. I think we just get credit for completion but I hope this does not appear up on that big screen as like an example. That would suck. Still gloomy outside. I wish I lived in like LOCNAME or somewhere with really good non-humid weather. My hair looks pretty bad today but it never really looks that fantastic so I guess it's not that big of a change. I feel really whiny or something. I need to call PROPNAME. Maybe I could meet some people through her. I hope so. No class until 0:00. At least I have a lot of time to finish my other stuff. Goodness I still have over five minutes. I sure do a lot of random thinking in twenty minutes. Why would they put such uncomfortable chairs in a dorm when they know that kids are going to be sitting there most of the time. I am so stressed out. Maybe that's why my face is breaking out so bad. Again I think why did I just say that. I'm sure no one wants to hear about stuff like that. I hope no one reads it and they just see my social security number and check me off on like some list. That would be good. Oh well too late now. That fan is so loud. I wish our air conditioning just worked so we wouldn't have to have all these fans. They are really annoying. My hands hurt from typing this much. I feel like I'm trying to make myself think of things to say. Why does my left hand or I guess wrist hurt more than my right. I love stretching. I wonder why that feels so good. I want to eat some sour candy. I like that. I still think about my boyfriend. 
__label__label0 This seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. I wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if I should capitalize my letters. Normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. I can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. Then there's the side of me that is analytical, am I typing too much? Why am I talking to myself? Damn a minute is a long time? There are always questions. I've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. I believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). I have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. The breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. It is also amusing that I, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. My room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; I already sleep too much. You would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. I feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. What happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? I think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 00 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. It's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. That's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. There is alot of dissapointment in the senses. Our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. I also wonder what this expiriment is for. What is it that you are trying to get out of me? My age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium?  That's a funny thing to say. My mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing.  Is it ok if i pause a few times. It's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. I watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something I now can relate to. It's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). I only wish I never do that to anyone, for I know how it feels and it is from that that I do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 00 minutes or can you finish your sentence. I guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.    
__label__label0      Ok, here I go. I wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this. Probably all kinds of things. Well, I have a girlfriend, her name is PROPNAME, and today is our 00 month aniversary. I'm excited but I'm sad that I don't get to see her that much because she is still in high school. She goes to PROPNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME just like I did. That's where we met. We were both on the cross country team. I'm kind of tired. I wish I didn't have to spend all my time reading the Iliad. It's getting really boring and I don't even think it's a very good book. They just like it because it's old. Like last night I spent several hours reading it and I still had to do more before I went to class today. Man, it's only been 0 minutes, I don't think I can actually think for a whole 00. I wonder what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this right now. Probably doing calculus homework or reading, heaven-for-bid, the Iliad. I can't wait until the weekend when I can relax some more. At least I only have one class tomorrow and it's really easy. It's calculus and this is my third year in a row of taking it for I shouldn't have any trouble with it. Unfortunately though it's all stuff I've already learned so it's boring also. Let's see, that makes two boring classes now. How about ancient LOCNAME and BA000, those are also boring classes, but at least I like LOCNAME so at times that class can be interesting. So that leaves psychology, that's definitely the best class I'm taking, because it's really interesting. Especially because many of the things don't have answers so it's just what you think. I'm probably biased towards it though, because I've always been a math and science fan. Math was ruined by one teacher I had, but I still love science. Hopefully, I can use the business skills I learn to start or work for something like a bioengineering company, that would be cool. Psychology is also fun because I know a few people in there. One of the guys in there I went to pre-school and kindergarten with and haven't really seen him since. Monday I met this girl named PROPNAME. She's pretty nice so I have someone to talk to before class. PROPNAME just got home, I wonder where he's been. He probably was at class, I wonder which one. He really likes Cake and he just turned them on. I can tell when he's in his room usually because there is music on. He also likes the Beatles. I don't really like the Beatles but Cake is cool. I wonder who just got on AIM. I guess it was PROPNAME because he just IMed me. I wonder what he wants. Maybe I'll have to tell him to go away, but I probably won't, because I'm not that kind of person. I don't like putting people down or causing conflict. I guess that's just who I am. I am, I think that's the best quote I've ever heard. It can be interpreted in so many ways and it's the only think that we know is absolutely true. 
__label__label0   I am so glad it is Friday. I am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town, so he is going to have some parties. I know it will be fun. I am also going to get to watch my brothers football game. He is a senior this year, and from what he has told me he is doing good in football. I only live an hour away from LOCNAME so I don't have a long drive. It could be long though if ILOCNAME00 is bad. I just go North on 00 until I get to Temple so I am happy about that because I don't have far to go. I also miss my boyfriend who I will get to see tonight also. We have been going out for 0 months now, which is definately a record for me. I sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me?  All my friends and my parents also ask me that same question. I just tell them I have no idea. He is a real nice guy though, and will do anything for me. He pays for everything and takes me anywhere I want to go or do. I do not like LOCNAME much, but i love ORGNAME. I know that is weird but I'm not much of a city girl. I hate all the traffic and the weird people. That is why I love going home because it is out in the country. We have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings. It is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you don't have the sounds of cars or big rigs. I like the apartment I am living in this year. I have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun. They are also from a small town so we get a long really well. Last year I lived in the dorms and I hated them. I lived in LOCNAME LOCNAME and they were real nice for a dorm but I didn't like them because I didn't have a kitchen or my own privacy. It really just didn't feel like home. My apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger. Well I wonder what I am going to do this weekend. Probably go to Cole's and do some homework and read. I want to float the river, I know I can talk Cole into doing that with me. Cole is my friend coming into town because his parents are out of town.  He plays baseball for PROPNAME PROPNAME in LOCNAME. His sister also goes there and she plays volleyball, and throws the shot and disk in track. There is also a guy from my school that plays basketball there. I actually live in LOCNAME LOCNAME- LOCNAME. Which is about 00 minutes outside of Temple. We are a 0A school and we won the basketball state championship last year. It was an awesome experience. It was the first time we had won state in any sport. We got second place in 0000, we lost to PROPNAME by like 00 points. Well I think I am going to take a shower and eat and then leave LOCNAME so I can get home in time to go to my brothers pep-rally. I talked to him last night and he said he was going to get to participate in the pep-rally so that starts at 0:00, so I'm probably going to leave in about an hour. That way I won't have to rush. This also seems like the longest 00 minutes of my life. I think I am going to have chicken strips for lunch and fruit punch to drink. I am very excited about next weekend. I am going to College Station to see my best friend and we are going to go to Ag-Kickoff. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and other bands are playing there. That will be a lot of fun and I am real excited. I went on the big ski trip last year with all of them and that was also a blast. 
__label__label1  atlast i m here writing this assinments which i was suppose 0 do long back. . i m wondering why am i such a late person doing everything at the last moment. i m just wondering why??i have become such a lazy bum don't feel like doing anything. i have become so boring. and why am i even thikin so much about it. right now i m more concerned about tmorrow. how is it going to be. who am i going to meet. am i going to meet new friends now thta i m in LOCNAME. sometimes i feel so intimated becuase its so big that sometimes ur just not noticed anywhere. what can i possibly do so that i make a differnce n people notice me and i make new friends. now that i m so alone. i really want to meet new poeple and make friends to hangout with. these days have been so bad for me. broke up with someone and i just got into ORGNAME and i harldy know anyone. i feel so alone sometimes. wondering am i really going to meet good people. sometimes i feel is everything going wrong with me only or what??i have not been studying lately just passing my time doing nothing. while i m writing all this how i wished i could talk to someone right now about what i feel. Its been a year now in this country and i still feel homesick. I still miss my friends back there. I really don't know what i should write. I m wondering what is this writing thing all about??what should i say i desperately want to meet people. Sometimes i feel so lonely in that big world. May be its just temporary feeling because i m just new to this place. Everything should be fine. I m just thinking about what i should be doing tommorow. ORGNAME more worried about what i should be wearing to college. One another hectic day get up early in the morning. Oh god why this torture of geting up early in the morning. I really like that guy i met a few days back. Wish we become friends. I really find him interesting. I hope the bookstore has got the books i wanted. I have been going there for long time but they still don't ahve the book. Where can i possibly find some work its is really boring sitting at home doing nothing. And why is that again i keep thinking about the guy i broke up with. Well we didnt break up technically but its not workin either. Wish i could just make a decision about us. Why is it getting so hard without talkin to him since the last few days. We are just not communicating well. What has really happened to our relationship. I wonder what he must be thinking about me. Why do i feel even the most handsome guy on earth wouldnt be of any interest to me now that i miss him so much. why the hell anythign went wrong. Anyways forget about it. Just snap out of it. Lets see what happens. I don't want to take it seriously. It would work if it has to. Well thats the spirit. wish i could just relax and think     
__label__label1 Why am I doing this? I don't feel like typing for 00 minutes. this is bound to be very boring. i'm already bored. i still have way too much time to kill. I'm really hungry. haven't had breakfest yet. i need to finish my homework though. I want to go out this weekend. my brother is also coming into town. I'm still bored. As usual, a song pops into my head when iu am really bored. I'm wearing no pants right now. its somewhat drafty. i'm going to look out my window now. no one is outside. i want some fresh air but i still have 00 minutes to go. I really should have taken a shower before i started this. Still hungry. my roomate is studying. i feel like bothering him. i just got offered a single room but i'm not taking it. I really want to listen to some music while i do this but  i can't.  we're not going to make it    pops into my head. I''m now going to stare at the poster on my wall. I really should throw out the  trash and make my bed. I still have to read my psychology textbook before i leave for my next class. I also need to workout. I need to learn out to type 00 words a minute. damn my fhand hurts. sucks to have tendonitis in both hands. 00 minutes to go and still extremely bored. I'm reaching my angry stage right now. I want to eat and i have to kill 00 more minutes, Might as well try some meditation. still have yet to decide if i want to finish my work before i go out tonight or if i do. I need to go meet someone tonight so i guess i better work. hey at least i'm halfway through. it would suck to be in prison. Now i jsut got a random word in my head. disestablishmentariasm. well then moving on. considering my week, its been pretty awful. I almost got mugged, someone got arrested for dealing drugs nearby me on that same night, and i accomplished nothing. i need to become more motivated. not going to school for a year does that to you. I really need to go learn judo. my sheets are looking pretty messy. i must go fold them in 0 minutes. i need to organize my books to and buy some new laundry detergent. Well if i am going to waste my time writing for 00 minutes i might as well make a shopping list. yesterday i watched orange county it was pretty amusing. then i went and did   dance dance.  yeah i really suck at that game. I really have almost nio hand to eye coordination. no wonder i took up pool recently. almost 0 minutes left. i think i should have made myself some green tea before starting this. eh i might go skip the crappy lunchs they serve at the cafeteria and go use my  0 bucks at pizza hut. i like pizza hut. its better than a lot of pizza chains. no pizza beats this one pizza place in greenwich connticut. i used  to walk a a mile to get to eat it when i was `00. those were the days. man my trash is full. i wish we could open our window. this room has a weird smell. must be all the ants i killed. stupid dorm  is infested. i want to go play some pool today. i've been practicing for 0 months straight to beat my brother at it. He took me for some money last time and this time i will dominate. well enough with my  evil plans (insert dr evil laugh). i have 0 minutes remaining and i am still very bored. i need to go take my vitamins. i think i need to buy some good cologne all the after shave i use isn't quite that great. It burns like hell especially since i hate to shave. if there was electrolysis for the face i would do it. well only 00 seconds left. i better save this in case it somehow gets deleted. it turned out to be somewhat fun. well not really. and i'm done. 
__label__label1      I was thinking about college and all the stuff that comes with it. college will be so hard yet so easy, i wonder how i will control myself. i don't want the fun factor to totally overrule the work factor. but then again, the classes seem pretty fun and not so hard. yet again, it has also only been a week of classes, so i could be sorely mistaken. we will just have to see what happens as time unfolds. i'm also a little worried because i have a boyfriend that goes to stephen f. austin state university, and driving distance that is 0 and 0/0 hours away!! how will i manage this?? we have been together for over a year and a half, so i can't just throw the relationship away, he means a lot to me. what do i do?? i guess i will give it time and see what happens. college is a lot to handle, and managing it all with a long-distance boyfriend is not easy. i don't know what i'm getting myself into. i'm also really pissed that i decided to stay at dobie, because after visiting friends in towers today i realized how much better it is, and what i rip off dobie is. the food sucks!! it drives me insane how bad it is and what a rip off everything is. towers is way better. i'm just glad that i'm rooming with my great friend PROPNAME in a badass apartment next year. yay!! we'll have our own rooms and all we'll have to do is take a short bus trip to campus every day. not that bad. plus we'll be more familiar with campus and won't get so lost, as i do here constantly. but it is my first year after all, so it can't be that bad. i'm also kind of nervous about my freshman seminar class, it sounds so ridiculously hard! a lot of writing and sharing your   feelings,   and all that stuff. i had to read like 00 pages just on how to   listen   correctly to other people. i'm 00 years old! i know how to listen! this is not kindergarten. it just makes me so mad. i'm really glad i met my friend shara, i knew her slightly my senior year in high school so we come from the same background and have a lot to relate to. i've gotten to know her so well these past 0 weeks that i feel like i've known her all my life! she's such a great girl. i like how she does not hesitate to compliment her friends for ANYTHING. great character trait to have. and i'm glad about all the parties that are here in austin, and the unique culture. walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though, but i'll never walk by myself anyway so it's all good. and i love the music scene. i'm afraid i'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown. i'm obsessed with spongebob! i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room, and i have spongebob band-aids. he's so cute! and the show is hilarious, totally my type of humor. i have the dvd as well, is that scary or what?? and you know what makes me mad? i got a heat rash here a few days after i moved in! that sucks! why here of all places? i think houston is MUCH hotter just because of the huge humidity factor. but NO i get a heat rash here. sucks. at least it's not visible, it's only little bumps you can barely feel. AND i got a popped blood vessel in MY EYE. what more could possibly go wrong? i guess a lot but it's so much to handle right when i get there! makes me so self conscious! i guess that's a psychology topic--why people get self-conscious. interesting topic. i would like to talk about it sometime in class. i think when i'm done with this i will do some physics problems and then just watch zoolander on dvd or something. yay. i'm so glad i have a tv, vcr, and dvd player! my room is totally pimped out, how great is that. i feel so exhausted. walking isn't easy in this heat, no matter what time of the day it is. i'm actually getting really hungry. i might fix myself a peanut butter sandwich. crunchy, but of course, what else? crunchy is the way to go. should i feel guilty about making plans to go to a party on a thursday night? is that bad? i don't really think so, seeing as on fridays i have only one 0 hour class from 00-0. wow that was a lot of 0s. god i'm so hungry, is this thing over yet? my hands are shaking. need food. aagh. peanut. butter. crunchy. does it matter if i'm coherent or not? it's just that when i get hungry, WHAM it hits me like a train and i get all hungry and can't help it. oh well. i hope this thing was entertaining for you, or whoever is reading this thing. i'm glad i got this over with early. yay im done. 
__label__label1  It is a rainy  grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around   my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer   has broken. I tell you what there is always something. more money   more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so   strange and makes me feel like  I'm walking on a tight rope. I hate   the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes   the money chase. I will be getting back to work very soon. Its been a   strange summer hit over and over.   It feels so good to see PROPNAME out of his brace!Man he took that whole   thing well. I think we both took it very well. Its hard to see someone   you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around   someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a   nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! I would have been a   emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 0 months   pretty well. Free again,yes!   my house always seems to become a mess, I just cleaned a day   ago.  It's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. I never seem to   keep up with a journal  I only write in them when I'm sad or   depressed. What a shame i could learn so much about myself . my   grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 0 pages   a day. Speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such   an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 0 letters from   her and still have not  written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! Less   talking more doing. That is so like me, I'm working on it but I love to   talk about the things I need / want to do instead of just going for it. like   working-out its silly . Ok I am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out. 
__label__label1      For labor day weekend I went home and visited my family. I had to go buy a printer today because my the one I have isn't working so my family came with me to help choose which one would be the best for me to have. They made me go to about five different stores so that I could buy the cheapest one, but the cheapest one was in the first store that we went into. I hate shopping and the fact that I had to go to five different stores to realize that the best one was in the first store made me so mad. I'm excited about coming to ORGNAME, but it's a culture shock with five hundered people in my class when I'm used to having about twenty-five. It's really exciting being here though. I miss my friends though. I get to e-mail them a lot, but it's not the same as getting to talk to them face to face. I really like the girls in my dorm though. They all seem to be really friendly and nice. I like my roomate too. I was worried that I wouldn't and would be one of those people trying to get information on how to deal with your roomate. I hear the television on in the living room at my grandparent's house. I wonder what they are watching?  I need to figure out how to football tickets for the next UT home game. That would be a lot of fun to go to. I'm kind of stressed out with all this reading I have to for each class. I'm so used to getting worksheets from high school. It's so weird how high school and college are so different. Everybody says that, but you never believe them until you get there. I'm having hard time of thinking of things to write down. I'm getting tired from this. I think I'm going to watch a movie at the theater tonight. I love watching movies that you've never seen before; you never know what's going to happen. I missed my dogs since I've been away from them and that's only been a week. I'm so used to having animals around that it's weird to go to my dorm room and not hear a bark at some point. I have a minature doxen, a whippet, and a mut. I also have three cats, but I'm closer to my dogs. I need to go to PROPNAME gym and see what exercise classes I can take there. I also need to see if any one will go with me. I think my grandpa is starting to cook supper. It smells like hot dogs or burgers. I hope he doesn't put a lot of spices on whatever he's cooking. I hate it when he does that. I wonder where my grandma is?  She should be back from town by now. Who knows. I need to e-mail my friends again before I forget. 
__label__label1      Well, apparently i'm supposed to just type for 00 minutes.  Being that it is September 00, i suppose it would a good topic. Everywhere i look i see something about 0/00. Even the clock at LOCNAME is stopped at 0:00. All of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 0/00.         The first thing i did this morning was turn on the television, almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 0/00. Why?  So i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else. It's almost a sense of deja vous or something. (i don't speak french). I really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers hadn't collapsed. Would everyone be okay less 000 people?            I'm really ready to see us attack LOCNAME. LOCNAME is just a big problem. I've always carried myself with little opinion because why should I, ME, say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be. I don't know much, all I know is what the news tells me. How can anyone say we shouldn't attack LOCNAME?  If we do, I am confident that it was the right thing to do. People just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do, we'd probably say the same thing.           These new   What if LOCNAME wasn't LOCNAME?   commercials are really fascinating. I find them very effective. I mean, a man goes to the library, and wants to find some books, it doesn't even matter the topic, and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested. I never really thought about that. I mean, I can go to the library, pick up a book on atomic bombs, check it out, and no one asks a word. It's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned. That's pretty cool.             Actually, my favorite commercial related to 0/00 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are, and they say:   Terrorists goal is to change the way of life of LOCNAME   or something like that, and then it shows the next day LOCNAME flags hung all over the building and says   they succeeded.   That is just a cool commercial. I remember when there used to be flags EVERYWHERE. Now you're lucky if you ever see them. I guess that's not natural to be so patriotic. I think we saw so many flags because we needed to be reminded that we all have something in common and we need to stick together.            The news is starting to get on my nerves finally. What is really weird is me, probably like many other people, were wondering what today would be like. Would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison?  I even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more. What happens?  Everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 0/00 in their thoughts, but refuses to let it take them down. It seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that. For a while after 0/00 i was pretty scared. I wondered what was going to happen. I almost didn't even want to be in the country. But then, when thinking about what i'd be giving up, I realized that even if the LOCNAME is under attack, it's still the best country in the world.            Now they are doing the   I am an American   commercial. They are analyzing how the different people say it. Makes me wonder how i would say it if I were to be on TV. Would i say it proudly, or with anger in voice (toward the terrorists), sadly, or just normal. The different tones were amazing. I never looked that much in the to the commercial until now. Wow. I bet now most people would say it proudly, but what about a week after the attacks?  Would you not say it with pride, yet more sorrow. There is just a huge amount of commercials on TV that deal with this situation.            Although commercials are effective, I feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music. Music is so powerful. You know, when you're hearing that God Bless the LOCNAME or America the Beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits. Similar to church I suppose. Whenever I'm at church I get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved. That's exactly how I feel when I hear those patriotic songs.              Well, I suppose in many ways, God was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing. The Sunday after 0/00 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches. I know I was at church. Everyone just needed to hear something good. I don't really worry about that stuff anymore. I figure it's like worrying i'm going to get the Red Nile Virus or whatever. I mean, they act like it's the terrible virus but it hasn't even killed 00 people. Heat kills more people than that. Let's go worry about heat now. No need to worry so much anymore, it is time to enjoy life. 
__label__label0     Twenty minutes seems like a really long time to do this assignment. I don't really feel like sitting here that long. I'm sleepy. I guess I shouldn't have waited until the last minute to do this assignment. If I would have finished it yesterPROPNAMEy, (like I planned) instead of going to sleep, I wouldn't be sitting here now. Hopefully I won't fall asleep in class. Especially my history class- it's kind of boring. I didn't finish this week's reading either. The professor said we're not having a discussion, so I'm really not worried about it. I'm tired of typing. I know I'm just supposed to be typing my thoughts, but all that's on my mind is other things that I could be doing with my time right about now- like SLEEPING. I really want to go to back to sleep. I really don't have time to go back to sleep either because I have a class in less than an hour. I wonder if we're getting our accounting quizzes back today??  I don't think I did very well. It's completely my fault though because I only did half of the reading and half of the homework. I wonder how PROPNAME and PROPNAME did?  ORGNAME's birthday is tomorrow. The other ORGNAME invited me. I'm not sure what's going on exactly, but we're supposed to be doing something. PROPNAME is a trip!! She's funny though. She lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME, but PROPNAME and PROPNAME don't really know her. I'm glad she came to choir rehearsal. She can sing. I don't think she needs to be in the alto section, but I don't think she's going to move either. Hopefully, she'll try out for a solo. I haven't heard her REALLY sing, but I don't think that   Bless Me   is too high for her. I'm so sleepy. I'm really excited about Innervisions though. I was glad to see so many new faces. I don't feel very well. I think I'm just tired. I should have gone to bed last night, instead of sitting up and talking all night. I didn't want to say anything because that's my friend, but his room smelled like old popcorn and feet. After I stopped and thought about it for a minute, I think that was pretty accurate. I'm only half/focused on this. I'm bored already. I'm looking up random people in the UT directory. Twenty minutes is a long time to just sit and type thoughts. My sister's birthday is tomorrow. I want to go home, but I really don't feel like driving. I talked to my mom yesterday, and she said that I didn't have to come. I want to go, I just don't want to drive. I may go home the weekend of my birthday. Initially, my parents planned to come to LOCNAME, but I haven't heard anything about parents's weekend, so I don't know if that's still going to happen or not. Since it's 0 weeks away, I need UT to let me know something so that I can plan accordingly. I want to go home so that I can eat. I want some boudain, Court Buillion, and a fried turkey. Those things don't really go together (at all) but that's what I want. I want to go to PROPNAME's Landing too!! That restaurant is the bomb. I would like to go on a Friday, but I don't think that's possible. I'll be teaching PROPNAME da PROPNAME, so I won't be able to make it back to LOCNAME before 00 or 00. Oh well, I guess I'll figure it out later. Yes!!! only 0 more minutes to go!!!!  I'm not sure what to talk about for the remainder of the time. I'll just ramble for a while. PROPNAME rambles sometimes. I love him, but he can talk and talk for long periods of time. I had lunch and dinner with him yesterday. It was cool. PROPNAME is one of the good guys. He talks about his girlfriend all the time (I'm jealous). I wish I had somebody, but God is still in control. He'll give me my wife in His own perfect time. 
__label__label0    I'm sitting here, listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window, on my balcony at ORGNAME towers and I'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud. A better question would be why couldn't they attach it to another outside wall that isn't in the middle of my balcony. I've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life. On the one hand, I adore it because I'm from LOCNAME and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here. If there was no air conditioning and I had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets, which I've noticed an insane amount of, I'd flip out. Why are there so many bums here?  I don't really know what to do when I pass them because I feel really really bad and want to help, but it's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they do with the money and why aren't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place. I just don't understand why they are so attached to LOCNAME LOCNAME. True, it's an amazing city, much of the reason I am here attending this school. It has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by. It just has the worst heat I've ever experienced and I don't see why the bums won't save their change for a bus ticket and go 000 miles north so they don't sweat to death in the heat because they can't buy water and I'm sure that's not what they'd buy if they could buy anything and I really don't understand how their bodies are still living. Which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming. It completely ruins the balcony. There is no other place I'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl I'm trying to hit on than the balcony with an incredible view, but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and I sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me. I think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly. I can't really say why, but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here. The Tv's on, we just got digital cable and it's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he can't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 00 dollars a month for the playboy channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it's soft core. True the girls are prettier, but is it really worth it? I think not. He's a bastard. All he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour. The kid doesn't move, he's a;ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is,   no man, but it's cool, it's cool.   The only time he's not sitting there bothering me when I bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 0 on a week night and decides he's going to study the one night that I decide to try and get some real sleep. There are 0 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which I am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. When I inquired why he was doing this and let him know that I actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was,   No, it's cool man,   it's cool, I won't keep you up.   As if it's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on. The time is up and though I wish   I could go on, which I easily could, I'd like to say one last time that my roomate's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening, Gentle Creek OUT! 
__label__label0      i don't know what to write. I think that the music next door is a little loud, and it always is at least when I'm trying to study. when you are trying to concentrate it always seems as noises are amplified, such as my roommate, studing, every turn of a page is very loud. She is studying biology, which is unusual because usually she complains about having to study, and now she is actually studying. I'm suprised she hasn't yet complained that my typing is bothering her. I hope it's not, but does it really matter. Anyways, I hope this is what I'm supposed to be writing about, and I really hope that grammer and punctuation are not observed too closely. I think it's time for dinner, well really I don't have a choice if I want to eat on campus, since everything closes at 0. It reminds me of my job at a retirement community, where everything closes very early. I wonder how my grades will be at the end of this semester. hopefully good, it's kind of difficult though because ORGNAME is so much different than my high school. I mean this class has 000 people tha's more than my entire high school, probably close to twice as big. But, it was my choice to come here and now I must adjust to my new life style. Being in a big city is so much different from a small town, the smell, the people, everything. Rather than the pleasent smell of trees, or the occasional smell of a BarBQ, there is a strong smell of trash and the numerous buses. But, again it is all okay, and with time everything will seem normal. Is that necessarily a good thing, I wonder. What am I going to do after college, no one can tell me what to do with my life, so I have to decide. But should we be forced to decide so soon, i mean we just graduated from high school. there are so many choices and paths to choose, and what if we choose the wrong one, will we be able to turn around and go back. I picked up a package today, my mom sent me some ORGNAME gifts. It's a good thing I actually checked the mail. At home I used to check it everyday, but here I never remember. I miss home, my dogs and my family, but mainly being familiar with everything and everybody. It's difficult to meet people, well at least for me it is. I can't just start talking to someone I don't know, but how will i ever meet anyone that way. the streets are noisy, i think its all the college, probably male, students driving by, engines roaring and music blasting, it's okay if they do that, but i'm trying to think about what I should type. This assignment should be equiped with spell check, that way you would never have to use the backspace button, or key whatever it is called. I really don't know anything about computers, which is kind of sad because my mom works for a computer company. Maybe that's the reason, why do i need to know when i could ask her and she could tell me. I reallt don't know what else to say I'm thinking that I'm glad that time is almost up because there are not any other things to talk about. These desk chairs are quiet uncomfortable, another reason I'm glad time is almost up. I sure have watched the time closely haven't I. 
__label__label1      Hey, well, I am really very nervous, writing down all of my thoughts and feelings on this computer and not in my own personal journal. Because, atleast there I know I will be the only one reading it. But I guess I 'll start writing about what I really have on my mind. My boyfriend and best friend just took off on a long truck ride back home, which is about six and half hours away. They (PROPNAME and PROPNAME) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes I miss them like crazy! PROPNAME means everything to me and I can't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away. But then again I decided to come to LOCNAME and not to Tech. Right? Well, that is one thing that is bothering me, the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother, who is only four years older than me, is causing some major problems back at home. And on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as I left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything. I feel really helpless because I am over here in LOCNAME and I can't help my sister or my dad go through their problems. I usually stuck up for them when I was home and now I just get to hear about them over the telephone. Which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story. I know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister I'm worried about. PROPNAME, my step mom is such a pain. She is very very, immature for her age and I saw this coming the whole time. I just wish my dad did so he doesn't have to be going thru this right now. I really miss home. I even miss my dog, Homie. I bet he feels like I abandoned him. I was the only one who paid attention to him, but I hope PROPNAME is taking good care of him now. I've only been in school for two weeks and it feels like it should already be november. Sounds pathetic, right? I'm wondering if this was the right decision. I sure hope so. I am a firm believer that God will never give me something that I could not handle by myself. So I just have to take this with a grain of salt and leave it at that. I just wish it was as easy as that. Gosh now it has been one hour and twenty minutes since PROPNAME has left. I keep looking at the clock like he is fixing to get here instead of him being on his way back home. We have become closer ever since I moved. It seems weird saying that but I really mean it. We actually have conversations on the phone, we talk on the internet, and when we see each other it feels like it did when we first started going out, four years ago! It feels great. I love him and I can honestly say that I will marry him one day. Heck, I'd marry him tomorrow if he asked me. He is my best friend and I can tell him anything. He is smart and funny and really good looking. Better yet, he is perfect. He has never cheated on me and always makes me feel like a queen. Sometimes I'm not sure if I deserve him. But I do love him and I always will. It still feels like I'm writing in my diary, although if I was I wouldn't be as consious about typos and mispelled words! I really like this assignment though, it sure beats the chemistry homework I really should be doing right now. I hate chemistry. I hate homework! But it has to be done, right? I often wonder what would happen if I just said to heck with it all and quit. My family would freak. They are so by the book. If anyone was to go out of the norm their whole world collapse. I hope I'm not like that to my kids. I want to be different. I want to make a difference not wait for someone to do it and then say hey I helped them get there. I want to be the one to do something, something special. I just figure out what. I just know that whatever it is PROPNAME is there with me when I do it. You know what? Its hard to type when your nose is running! But I'm almost out of time so I'll keep on typing. I can do it, I can do it! Ha, ha thats kind of funny. Speaking of funny isnt if funny how when your onthe internet you mispell words on purpose and here I am trying really hard not to misspell anything, even when it doesn't matter if the words are mispelled or not. That is bizarre. Remember that song   How Bizarre   I hated it but PROPNAME always sang it and it drove me crazy. Thats funny 
__label__label1 Oh no!  I wasn't ready!  Oh well!  This seems weird to me to write what I think. I think very random things. I really like school here but miss my family. My roommate is going out tonight and she looks cute. It is some kind of formal for a frat. I don't like the frats here. The boys make me feel uncomfortable. A lot of guys do that though. They don't seem to notice me in any way. It is kind of weird. All this time I thought it would be better once I got to college and the guys would notice me, but nothing has really changed. They all still see me as a cute friend girl. But I am beginning to accept and like that. I am beginning to kind of like being   one of the guys  !  Oh poot! I forgot to put an away message on my Instant Messenger. I hope no one IMs me. Maybe I should do that. It will only take a sec. Okay!  Done!  It feels like time is passing so slowly as I type. Maybe it is because I want this to be over with. I feel like I type a lot slower than I thought. At least I use all my fingers and not just my pointers. I feel sorry for the people that do that. If I were to keep thinking in this way, will whoever reads this think I am a huge loser?  Am I a loser anyway for doing this assignment almost 0 weeks before it is due?  Wait, I think it is two weeks and one day away from being due. Or 0 weeks and 0 days!  I think. Maybe I don't even know the due date and am just getting ahead. I think that is right. I just scratched the scab on my arm and it hurt. I don't know how it got there. I feel like such a little kid!  I fall all the time and have bruises all over my arms and legs and scabs on my elbows and knees. I am such a clutz!  I need to adjust my screen because it is getting hard for me to see what I am writing. I hope I am not misspelling any words. I am not the best speller, and when I am typing it gets worse. I always spell because-   BECASUE  . It is terrible. I think people rely on computers too much to fix their mistakes for them. We now even can talk on the phone through the internet and stuff. That can help us fix relationship problems. My roommate is putting lotion on. She makes me laugh a lot!  Actually it isn't hard to do. But the funniest person is my brother in law PROPNAME. He is so hilarious. All he has to do is say one word and I will bust out laughing. I wish that I could be that funny. Laughing makes people feel good!  My cousin used to say that it makes you live longer to laugh. I wonder if she is right. She laughs even more than me!  My roommate just sneezed and I laughed because she did!  See!  I just had to go back and fix because, because I spelled it wrong!  Anyway!  Back to my cousin. She has become my best friend. (or at least one of them)  I miss her a lot. LOCNAME and LOCNAME are far from each other and since she is only 00 it is hard for her to be allowed to come down here without her parents throwing a fit. They probably are worried about me. I sent them an email today because my aunt is a teacher at ORGNAME's SUmmit, and she used to teach at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I met a guy that had her as a teacher. He goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. That is only 00 minutes away!  I am developing feelings for him. I went out with 00 boys on Friday, and I was the only girl. PROPNAME, the boy, was there too, and we hung out a lot of the time. He is really a great guy. I want to get to know him better. I saw him last night at our friend's house that introduced us, and he barely talked to me. I tryed to talk to him, and he was, I think, trying to talk to me, but this girl named PROPNAME kept interfering. She goes to ORGNAME and came down for the weekend to see all her   best friends  . Whatever. She kept keeping him from talking to me. He told me to follow him around at one part. He made me laugh a lot. I really like it when guys make me laugh. Another thing is that he makes me feel comfortable around him, like I have known him for a long time. That is another thing I look for in guys. Being comfortable and laughing is a good combination of things to be. It makes me happy. My roommate is talking to her sister right now, and it makes me miss my sisters. They are both older than me and I miss them. I actually hung out with them all day today, so I don't know why I miss them. I love them a whole lot. It is amazing how when we grow up, we all become closer even though we are 0 and 0 years apart. I guess growing up makes everything between my family better!  PROPNAME PROPNAME is not cute and PROPNAME is crushing on him and she made fun of me. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such a liar and a big jerk. I don't know what made me think I would have fun with him. HELLO!!  Differing personalities TOTALLY!!  I like musicals, for instance, and he doesn't know a thing about them. I want to be an actress one day, speaking of musicals, and I would love to do a show on LOCNAME!  I want to go to LOCNAME, though, first. That would be awesome to make a movie. PROPNAME and her sister are even getting closer like my sisters are. WOAH!  That was totally off subject. I think it is because I am now writing this and listening to PROPNAME talk. That is hard to do. Kind of like listening to music and studying. It is hard. TIME UP! 
__label__label1 Here I go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the LOCNAME hill conutry. Useraly the frist thing I notce are the ceder trees, and while I like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. Sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. Oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. Thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. This is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. Another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. Just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. Yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.      
__label__label1 The one thing that amazes me the most is the  complexity of the female mind. At one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. Also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. If you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. The more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. The only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. True, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. No matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. I've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand. The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. The more you drink it in, the better it feels. You know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. Then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. Reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. The only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. The old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. It may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. Somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. That or it seems less pathetic.     It's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. When I was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. My parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that I listened to, so I always told myself that if I ever became a musician, I would never include those kind of things in my songs. However, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. However, I wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of PROPNAME. I also think that people overreact to his music. He is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician. 
__label__label1      well i am not exactly sure what i should be writing about but i guess it have no choice. i am noticing that my room is overly cluttered, that the tv is on and that my neighbors dog is barking i feel kind of warm althought that isnt totally weird i usaully am warm in this place. i have to be at work by 000 and i hope i can make it. i don't really like working there anymore because it is usually very stressfull, all the snobby rich people and the terrible managment, no my foot hurts probably because i have been placing my weight under it, tomorrow i don't have to work so i guess i can work out, i do like to work out its more the act of dealing with all the people in my way that i don't like. i don't like waiting. i hate when someone is just sitting on a machine or talking and isnt doing anything wastes my time. i also don't like it much when people talk to me in the gym, takes me away from what i am there to do. the semester has just started and i already feel a little pressure from all the upcoming events, the reading , the studying, the homework. sometimes i wonder why i am here, i start to think that maybe i am wasting my time when i have no idea what i am doing with my career, should i have known before i got to college?  i don't think so, thats what its all about, learning about yourself, finding out who you really are. wow only 0 minutes have gone by. this is going to be a long assignment, i wonder how long eveyone elses assignments were. i am sure they were longer, seems like i never write enough or my writing is too vague. however last semester in government i did very well in my writing assingments. i tend to do better in the analytical process then i do in the creative process or at least thats how it seems to me, however some times i do have a very clever idea or unique way of looking at a porblem that enables me to break through. it usually invloves some one telling me i can't do something. that usually kicks my brain into over drive, i usually never tell myself i can't do it, just that i havent figured out how to yet. that makes it easier for me to look at that problem. this may sound retarted but when i was in highschool and my parents started locking the liqour cabinet, i remember looking at it and thinking wow  how am i going to get around that. i don't see a problem as a barrier, but a wall to climb, so i took out the drawer on the top of the cabinet and reached my hand inside and pulled out whatever i needed, it sounds terrible but it was a very good solution to the problem of how to get the tequila out of the locked cabinet. sometimes i wonder what i would be able to do with harder real problems. i like thinking that i can defy others imagination, makes me feel like i am a little more clever than they have imagained. i always enjoyed upsetting peoples ideas of myself. or breaking stereotypes but putting my self into a place to be judged in that given stereotype, like when i shaved my head, i am in no way a skin head and i adopt none of their ideals or beliefs but i enjoy seeing the look of surprise on someones face when i can have a complex conversation on engineering concepts or hamurabi, or some eastern philosophy. its the initial look of dawning comprehension that i live for. like when i hide things from some one i want them to figure out where it is, just so i can see that burst of intelligence into their thought process that enlightens them to the location of their shoe, or where there keys are. even better then that is to have them have that dawning but then when they reach for their shoe it isnt their shoe, the sudden seize of thought is also as rewarding. or seeing if you can predict some ones actions but predict two steps forward so that when they realize you have predicted their action and begin to change you have predicted their realization of you predicting. the one thing i love of about the human body is its ability to change, to become something different then what it start out as, but in the end we are all the same, nothing more than complex organic molecules and one could argue that we really arent that complex just resilient. i want to make the human machine better, smarter, faster, stronger, but is it possible to perfect millions of years of constant evolution?  who knows, maybe the next step will be to fuse mental ability with a better creature, something that man creates in his own image, we could build on the millions of years it took humans to become what we are. and in turn we could make the next level of human evolution, but this might threaten the entire order of things, we would no longer be the top of the food chain. and these altered beings would they be good  or would they use their abilites for selfish purposes. i think that if i was some how better than everyone else then i would use my abilities for good, but isnt that asking alot of some one?  what if they want to be self serving, just because they have these incredible gifts should they be forced to serve. Tis better to rule in hell then to serve in heaven. what would the world be like if everyone only looked out for themselves, we wouldnt have any firemean any policemen, no one would help others, or at least not without some sort of compensation. i enjoy doing something for someone when i don't expect to recieve anything in return, makes you feel better about yourself, and if they do give you something then it makes you feel 000% better then before, its not what you do  but who you do it for i would rather do something great for someone else then to do something great for myself 
__label__label1 Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 0 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 0000 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA000, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 0 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in LOCNAME, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 00 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 00 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $00 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 0 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to ORGNAME's next football game. The one against LOCNAME LOCNAME was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when PROPNAME from LOCNAME LOCNAME is seen in LOCNAME LOCNAME, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 00 seconds left. . 0 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. 
__label__label0      Wow, I remember when my english teacher made me do this. It is kind of weird having to do it now. I don't think my teacher really liked english at all. What was the deal with the random acts of kindness journal anyway?  PROPNAME PROPNAME is a great musician. I should put his CD on now to break the silence. 00 minutes?  I think I might have to piss sometime in the next 00 minutes. I guess I should have thought of that sooner. I need some   my-size   chicks in my classes. I see them around campus occasionally, but never in my classes. Actually, there may have been some in Psy. , but there were 000+ people. Damn it! I don't need to install any more MS stuff. Quit popping up that update!  I said okay yesterday hoping it would cut me a break, but it is just like the ORGNAME ORGNAME . once you donate stuff, they never give you a break. Hoo Hah!  PROPNAMEe for some PROPNAME. Man, I love the woofer on my computer!  I have the best,   phattest   bass on my computer stereo. I think my parents miss me. When I call them, it is hard to get off of the phone ever. I hope that I don't get much homework in college. I like SNL, where Tim PROPNAME did that sketch with the SportsCenter impersonation.   Right about now, the funk soul brother PROPNAME PROPNAME!  Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Sweet sassy molassy!    I can't wait until PROPNAME PROPNAME comes back to LOCNAME. His concert was cool. I need to keep on writing. ORGNAME ORGNAME was a sweet film. I really like the girlfriend in that movieGoddamn update reminder just froze up my computer!!!! ORGNAME is an evil empire!  They don't even give you a way to close the reminder so you just have to leave it there. Crapola!  Don't even ask me when I want to be reminded of the update. Suck it, PROPNAME!  I bet I seem kind of screwed up if anyone browses this. I love the PROPNAME song   comfortable,   even though it is a chick song. I wonder if these shoes make me look gay when I wear them with shorts?  Oh well, they are comfortable, so whoa, I just spaced out there for a few minutes. I really should go change the punctuation of the previous sentence. I have always felt like I am missing out on something by never having a girlfriend. LOCNAME kind of sucked. Maybe it is like getting a car- it is cool for a week or two, and then it loses its glamor. I wonder why no one is sunbathing on Jester beach Damn it! I don't want to update my computer! I did it yesterday!  I miss the good 'ole DOS days. Go to hell, PROPNAME!  Man, for a multi-billionaire, you would think he could get a friggin' descent haircut. It looks nice outside, with the warm sun rays blanketing the gently swaying oak limbs outside my grimy window. I wonder why people say it is a nice day outside, when it is actually better to have cloudy skies to block UV rays and keep me from having to squint. I think the people across the hall are kind of strange. Not PROPNAME and PROPNAME, but their suitemates. They have all those slutty posters on their wall and whenever I walk by they are playing computer games. Dr. Pepper is the shiznat!  Shiznat . he he he he he!  I am such a friggin' loser! Criminy!  I just lost it again for about 00-00 seconds. I only have two minutes to go now, so I think it is time for a new paragraph.  My fingers are tingling a little bit, which is pretty strange since they should be getting blood from my typing. Oh, well. Maybe I should have kept playing guitar instead of biking. Racing is fun, but you can play guitar anywhere and you don't have to worry about crashing or winning or anything like that. You just can't screw up much while playing in front of an audience. I just copied most of my writing so I can see how much I did. 
__label__label1      Alright, so this is my second time to do this, which is kind of weird. It's kind of draining to type out what you are thinking. I'm still worried about what I am going to do for my object exercise in Acting I. So many people have taken my ideas. But since we are all the same age, we pretty much have the same issues and experiences so I'm just going to go with what comes natural to me. Ugh, I still can't get ahold of PROPNAME. Unfortunately, openning night for his play falls on OU weekend which really sucks. Ugh, it seems like everything going on in my life conflicts with everything else. Speaking of OT game, the things they make us do just to tickets to some game. I mean, first you have to wait in line to get a wristband and PRAY that you get a somewhat decent number. And then you have to go back and wait in line for the tickets, that is assuming you even get tickets. It's crazy and aboult a million people came up to me today asking me to get them tickets. Geez, I never thought going to a football game would be so stressful. On top of that, this week is the anniversary of September 00th and so now everywhere I go I am reminded of this horrible tragedy. I'm proud of our country coming together, but I don't think we should dwell on the bad things. We should move on, remember, and renew. For example, this morning I flipped on my TV and the first thing I have to see the images of 0,000 American people losing their lives. It just hasn't been a good day. Hopefully, Friday (yes, Friday the 00th) will be a bit better. Could this week spell   hell   more than one way?  Actually, tomorrow should be a pretty good day. Although it's going to be hectic, tomorrow night will at least be the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. OH YEAH!  Go Alpha Phi!  I'm excited since PROPNAME gets to come too. It's going to be tons of fun. And this week is Big Sis week so I get a lil gift everyday too!  It's funny how little good things can measure out the big bad things. Oh and plus I am going home this weekend. Going home this weekend is just the thing I need. I miss my family and my dog sooo much. Aww, my cute little Pepper. I can't wait to see her. And my mom can wash some of my clothes for me!  WOOHOO!  Oh, and Friday night is callbacks for the play PROPNAME. I am soo excited because I actually made a callback on my first audition here at LOCNAME. So that's one more good thing. Wow, maybe I should go over all the good things in my life more often. Then maybe I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed and stressed out as much. hmm, after this I better start reading biology. For being such a somber day, today (weather wise at least) was actually a really beautiful day. I have a great view of the sunset out my window. And since there is a church right across the street, the sunset lights up the huge cross so beautifully. Maybe one day I should take a picture of it. Oh yeah, I need to buy some more sticky tape to hang my posters with. You'd think something called   Poster Putty   would do the job but aparently the posters made out of paper are toooo heavy. And what's the deal with not being able to hang dorm lights. First of all, christmas lights are a dorm tradition, and secondly the package says   Dorm   lights so technically they aren't christmas lights. right?             
__label__label0      I'm just sitting here by the computer thinking of something to   write about. I just finished my Inorganic class, met a really nice guy   who is now my partner for this, however he is married. Two of my   friends are sitting in this same room, talking about math problems.  Man, am I glad my math requirement is over and done with. I'm also   so worried about my med schhool application. Is this what I really   want to do with my life? On the other hand, do I not want to go ahead   and try? Will I regret it if I give up? Will I regret it if I don't? Sometimes   I think all I'm afraid of is hard work. When I think about applying to   grad school, I start to worry about how hard it'll be to my phD   dissertation! Talk about borrowing trouble. I don't want to disappoint   mama, she does so much for me, but no matter how hard I try, I feel   that she's never satisfied with who I am, even though she always   says she is. I'm glad she came to visit me this time, but I'm also so   scared of disappointing her. If she ver knew I got that C for math. ! I   keep thinking about LOCNAME a lot too. Mama said continuously that   he wasn't the right man for me, deep down I know that too,  so why   am I still with him? He always puts me down, and I know half his   compliments and   lovering   is not sincere. Maybe it's the sheer   convenience of livjng together. Although sometimes I wonder what   the hell's so convenient about it! He makes me spend my money   like there's no tomorrow, I've cried more times with him than at any   other time of my life. However, I've also spent the last six and a hlaf   years with him, so there must be something I need that I'm getting   from him. It's hard to let go of something you've had for so long even   if you know it's not very good for you. I like meeting other guys   though, and it comforts me to know that even if I did leave him, I   needn't be alone. Sometimes I think I'd rather be a little prettier than   a little smarter - like I have a choice! But if I did, I think pretty girls   have an easier life than the smart girls, for the simple reason maybe   that pretty girls don't have much to think about. I used to alwasy envy   the pretty girls at school, even if they were younger and dummer than   I was! It was a shock to realise a few years ago, that they had all   been jealous of me. I sure do miss high-school. Sometimes I think   that was the happiest time of my life -even with all the ons of   problems I had. Living at home with mama and PROPNAME was so hard   sometimes, but I had my friends, and it seems as if even PROPNAME   loved me more at that time. To be fair, he also didn't see me 00   hours a day when we were in high-school either! I loved hanging out   with my friends, I've never laughed so hard as when I was in   highschool. It was nice being known by everyone. I miss my click, I   can't wait to see Ash and PROPNAME and hopefully PROPNAME in the winter.  I'm sure PROPNAME must be going through the same things now. I feel   so bad for him, but being a tyypical boy, I can't ask hi to talk to me,   his sister, about any feelings. Then again. even if I did, I'd have no   idea about what to do if he broke down. That boy's badder than I   thought he was! He always looks so innocent and sweet, but deep   down, he's a real bad-ass! And mama and PROPNAME think I was the   flighty kid. Sometimes I wonder if I really am happy with what I've   become. I don't dare talk about it to anyone because everyone thinks   I'm perfect. My bosses, my parents, my friends and co-workers. If I try   to talk to LOCNAME about these feelings, he just belittles me, so I   really have no one to talk to. I could talk to  mama, sometimes I wish   I did, but then, she expects so much from me, and I'm so sure she'll   scoff at my worries. She treats me as though I was still an   impetuous child, in need of being humoured. I wish I could make   her see me seriously someitmes. So many people are expecting   me to do well, they depend on me to do them proud. I feel like my   grasp on things os slowly slipping away. What am I going to do   when I graduate? Will I ever amount to anything? Will I ever make   mama happy with me and feel as though I have fulfilled her dream? I   miss PROPNAME. For all his bluster and old fasioned ways, he's a lot   simpler to please than mama. And daddy, dear daddy, he just wants   me to be happy, but them, I feel as though he doesn't know much   about me, and daddy isn't the sort of person I cold expose any deep   feelings to. He's just not that kind of man. So I have to go along, and   try to do the best I can with what I have. It's not an especially hard lot   even though I fret so much. I have a great family who would do   anything for me, I have a home and a brother who now lives with   me. I have aboyfriend who even if he doesn't give me verything I want,   apparently gives me something I need. The future I suppose, will   just have to work itself out. These crazy thoughts and fears in my   head will just have to sort themselves out, maybe in time they will. I   have to try not to go bonkers, but I just feel so overwhelmed   sometimes, like I'll never get a grasp on my future, or I'll never be   truly happy. I think I know on thing for certain now, I can never be truly   happy if I marry LOCNAME and I need to try and get away from him if I   can, no matter how hard it may be, and it will be very, very hard. 
__label__label0      I am really tired. I got up this morning at 0:00 to go get tickets for the seniors in my fraternity, and I don't even know if I'll get to go. They're for the LOCNAME vs. OU game in October. I was up last night until 0:00 and I had to wake up at 0:00 this morning to go wait in line at the stadium. I have the song   ORGNAME ORGNAME   by PROPNAME PROPNAME in my head because last night, after walking PROPNAME back to her room, I came in to find three half-naked, drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate. They were making him play   LOCNAME LOCNAME   while they sung and taped the entire episode. They claimed to be filming   Towers Gone Wild,   which was a take-off of   Girls Gone Wild,   only filmed at Towers. I have recently been seeing a cute girl, but I am sort-of afraid of commitment. Twenty minutes seems to me like a long time to type. I've barely made it through six minutes, and I am pretty much ready to go to bed and stop doing this. This girl is really cute and sweet, but I just got over a really hard break-up, and I am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen. I think that it is funny that, although I'm supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness, my spelling and grammar are almost impeccable. I wonder if the person who reads this will agree. I probab;y made a typo on some really easy word, and therefore the grader will assume that I am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults. Or maybe that's me talking. Maybe I'm   grading   myself when I say something like that. Nine minutes and forty three seconds. It's funny that by the time I had written   nine minutes and forty three seconds,   that time had passed. I am now very ready to stop this assignment. Twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for, but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping. I wonder what Tank is doing. I wonder if PROPNAME is going to come over to   see   him. I don't like PROPNAME very much. I think she's very annoying. She whines far too much. Now I'm whining about her. I hope I'm not keeping my roommate up with my typing. This keyboard is pretty loud. I still have to write for another seven minutes. My neck itches. There, that's better. My composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since I mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar. Tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought. He doesn't really respect people's space too much. But he's an overall pretty good guy. If I go to sleep in fifteen minutes, I can take a three and a half hour nap before I have to be at the house to build. I am not going to Philosophy. I am too tired. I don't really think I'll be missing too much, because if I did go, I would fall asleep in there as well. My bed is much more comfortable than those tables in the Law Building. That is a really long walk. I takes thirty minutes. My back hurts. I need a shower. I need a cup of iced tea. I actually don't NEED either of those. I just WANT a shower and a cup of iced tea. And a nap. I'm a pretty funny guy, if I put my mind to it. Right now, I'm not putting my mind to anything but sleep. English was boring today. just like every other day. I think I probably failed that reading quiz. I probably got a fifty. I read about fifty percent of the selection. My professor must be pretty good at making quizzes if they're that accurate. I never had that happen in high school. I'm just going to stop now. Good night. 
__label__label0 I am so tired. This headache is really getting to  me. I wonder if I can make it through the classes today. Why is my foot numb. Sleeping on the floor last night really hurt. I wish the little boy did not cry so much. I hope I will have enough money to go to LOCNAME for Christmas. I really miss him. It is so hard that his parents don't like me. I know they don't, even if he says they do. Wow my headache is going away. I think I am  hungry. I won't eat until 00:00, that way I can make it through my classes. I am dreading the first one. Social work is so boring. Why did I get myself in it. Man my stomach cannot wait to eat. ouch. I need to clean my sheets. I need to read first though. I wish I had a more comfortable chair in here. I need to save my money. I hope I have enough to last the year. This sucks struggling to have enough money. I should not cross my legs it is bad for the blood flow. I need to stand up straight too. Slouching is not going to help what I already did from sleeping on a floor with no pillow. Man I have so much to read. All I want to do is sleep. I cannot sleep though I have to read, run, work, go home this weekend. I am dreading that. All I want to do is sleep and I have to get up so early just to go to church. I wish Granny would just let me sleep in once. At least they do not sing in the LOCNAME I keep messing up in my writing. ahhh! This is driving me crazy. I need to correct all my mistakes too. I hate mistakes. I hate messes. I hate the fact that this computer is a piece if junk and I cannot afford to buy a better one. I am lucky in life though. I admit that. I should be happy with what I have. There is not use telling myself this,  it only makes it worse. It just makes me think of everything that is wrong. I wish I could disappear for a little bit. I wish I could go back to LOCNAME right now to be with LOCNAME. He makes me so happy. He makes me realize how great I am. He shows me how much he cares. I am so happy he is my boyfriend. I just wish he did not have to go back. What do his parents expect. I cannot  speak Portuguese. How was I supposed to talk to them. They cannot know what kind of person I am. I tried to stay out of the way. I did not know what to do. I think they are not telling him the whole truth. Of course they  would not tell him that they do not like me. Plus he is moving here later for me and he is their baby. They would have to deal with PROPNAME again. There I go crossing my  legs. This room is freezing. I only like it like that at night. I wish I did not worry so much. It makes my head hurt. I wish I did not have to worry for  just one day. Everything is going wrong this year. I do not want to call Dad. He will just talk about bills and the divorce. He will  sigh 000 times. He will make excuses then talk about work and ask why I never see him. I hope he does not talk about when he went to church for the first time in 00 years. I do not even like that church. They only make fun of my religion. I need to learn to be more nice about it. I just don't what that weird place converting my PROPNAME. I worry about her. I worry about PROPNAME. What is going to happen to them. Quit crossing your legs. I wish my nails were long. They are so thin. I need to go to the store for food. I need to save my money. I can deal with the food the dorm gives me. I will just drink water in my room. My car stinks inside. I hate when I get out and I smell like smoke. I should check the oil. I will do that today after I run. I cannot believe I went from 00:00 to 00:00. I was doing so well running before. I did not change anything. I hurts now to run. I cannot breathe. I do not want to go to the doctor. I just need to get used to the air. Although I have been back home for a month now and the air was not much different in LOCNAME. I hope the shot of pain that goes through my  heart goes away. I just imagine an artery clog. I am so young and I eat healthy. I bet it is stress, or I am not breathing correctly. This itch on my nose needs to go away. Quit crossing your legs. Type faster so I can keep up with my mind. This is kind of hard because I think of what I type. There goes  my nose again. At least I stopped crossing my legs. Yay, I am almost done. I am hungry too, but I have to  wait 00 more minutes. I should have had something little this morning. I  hope I don't get fat. I am already fat as it is. I need to get rid of this stuff. It is so hard. IT will not go away. It is just that one area. I will get surgery when I am rich. h ahah that is a good way of looking at it. Like it will ever happen. I do not even know what I want to do with my life. Why do I worry about all this stuff constantly? 
__label__label0 I'm not really sure what to write. What are they going to be looking for when they read this Oh well it's easier that having to write normal paper I have so much to do this weekend. There are way to many classes that I have to study for This semester is going to be so stressful. What am I going to wear tonight?  I need go through my closet after this. I also need to call PROPNAME. I hope I get my application soon so I can start working on it. I really hope I get in. I not sure what to think about. I wonder who's going to be reading this. I guess I'll start my biology homework after this. I hate that class and nutrition. I hope I get better classes next semester. I wonder if PROPNAME is home. I need to talk to her about the game on Saturday. I hope our seats are good. This twenty minutes is going by really slow. The guy next door is blasting his music again, but at least it's not night time. I wonder it there is anything good on television. Probably not. Having cable sucks without movie channels. It's hard to think and write about at the same time. I wish I could drive home on Saturday, but I'll wait until the weekend after next. Maybe I can go to the mall this weekend. I want a new outfit for next Thursday. It will be such a relief when recruitment is over, unless I don't get in. Oh well I'll something else to do on campus if not. I have so much studying to. It's only been ten minutes?  I wish I had something to drink. I need to call so many people back. I wonder what PROPNAME will come down to see me?  Hopefully I can get us both game tickets. I need to go eat before I leave soon. I so tired of eating Cafeteria crap. I will be in an apartment again next chair. Maybe I'll eat at mall tonight. I wonder if my mom mailed me my stuff yet. I probably won't get it till Saturday or Monday. I am tired of doing this. what else can I think about? I need to finish my laundry this weekend and get change for the machines? I wonder how PROPNAME's doing? I miss dog. I need go through my calendar. My exams next week are going to kill me. This is such a waste of time. No more psychology courses for me. Maybe I can get a nap in before I leave, no have to much to do. I am so far behind. What's in my closet that I could wear tonight? I should have gone shopping last weekend but I need to stop spending so much extra money. Is somebody really going to analyze all this? Good I'm almost done. They need to turn the music down next door        
__label__label1 I am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. I can't really smell anything because I'm getting over a cold. I'm thinking about last night. My sorority had a party at PROPNAME's and my date just didn't show up. I've been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. Either way he owes me big time. Now I'm listening to the Doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. I trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. I have a class today that I have to read for before 0 o'clock. I really don't feel like reading for that class, but I guess I have to. It's biology and I like the class, but I just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which I am not to excited about. My foot is starting to hurt because I was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. I hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up I guess you would call it. This CD that I'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. It's not my CD or I would know what is on it. I wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. I mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. It's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. I have a download capability on my computer but I don't use it all that often, so I doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. I understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. Many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the CD. I have no idea who this song playing is by. I still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, I really need to try and wash them off before I forget about it and go to class with them still on. I don't like the way they write exes on your hands. Is not one hand enough? They really don't need to mark both of them. I don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. There would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. Last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as I was expecting it to be. Well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. I'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so I'm more excited about that. He is not coming in until much later though, I wish he could come earlier. I also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for ORGNAME ORGNAME, another thing that the sorority throws. Life is so hectic at college, I don't ahve time to really do anything. I don't know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I'm behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. But then next week, the cycle starts all over again. I guess that's why I feel like I'm never caught up completely. We're listening to School's Out for Summer", I wish it was! But that won't happen for a very very long time. But I had fun this summer. I didn't have a job, so I got to do whatever I wanted. It was fun. I really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. They're all clean but thrown around from when I was trying to figure out what to wear last night. I need to go to the grocery store too, I'm out of bottled water and drinks. I need to get more hangers too. Ok enough of this random writing, my 00 minutes are up. 
__label__label1 As I sit here in my dorm room, I am really tired, probably because I stayed up late doing homework last night. My body feels sore but I like to workout so that doesn't really bother me much. I can not really concentrate right now, but that is probably because I just woke up and I still feel half asleep. I feel very stressed out right now because I have a chemistry exam on friday and I need to read to the chapters. I guess I should not have procrastinated, but I do that a lot. My roommate is actually going to class for once, and I am very happy for her. Hurray! I thought this assignment was going to be a lot easier than it is, but I guess not. I am really thirsty right now. My hair has gotten really long, and I am very happy about that because I cut it all off recently but it is growing back. My knee really hurts because I am out in the hot sun, but then go in the freezing classroom, so whenever there is a temperature change my knee aches. My junior year in high school I tore my ACL and had reconstructive surgery, so I have screws in it. My roommate just left and it is so hard to do anything around here because she just keeps talking to me even when it is obvious I am busy. How annoying! And she uses my computer all of the time to talk to her boyfriend and it is my computer. Like when I got on to do this paper, she wrote that she had to go and she was sorry but hopefully I would be quick about it. I wanted to tell her something so bad but we have to live together for a year and I don't want to make it a living hell. I don't know how to approach the situation with out us hating each other, but if this keeps on, I will end up hating her. Living with girls sucks because we are all so petty. I skipped my calculus discussion this morning, but it is my only class on tuesdays and thursdays and it had to be at 0 a. m. in RLM, which is so far and I hate that building! well my time is just about up and I am really excited because I am tired of typing. 
__label__label0 Right now I just feel tired and when I usually don't look at the key board I notice that I am right now because the timer is messing me up. I see things going across my eyes and hear a girl walking. I just saw her. I can hear computers on and I'm still tired. she laughed and it makes me sad I've been sad for quit sometime now and I don't know why. head tilted to the side and staring and the screen. when I was looking at the key board the girl took my mind off of it and back to the screen. I hear my typing and the girl next to me typing. left foot over right foot and back is relaxing. it's weird to know I took the 00 out of my calculus time to do this instead. I can't type for twenty minutes because when I do I get more tired than I already am. I'm relaxed now and more slouched in the chair than before. my back is hurting me and my fingers are still going constantly pressing the backspace as though I will be graded for typing skills . it's habit the more I stop to not do that it keeps going. right leg is over left now and I'm still typing who would have thought 0 minutes was long? I'm really thinking of nothing right now but then I start to think of the thing I will be heading out to in a few. my eyes are heavy and I can hear the printer shuffling is going around and my hands are getting kinda tired now. I hear someone in the back typing at the same speed and it makes me think they are doing the sam e thing I am doing. I had a long day and I'm tired but most of all I feel stupid. it's only the beginning of the semester and I just turned in my first calculus assignment and I didn't do it right I probably only did about 0/0 of it right. my eyes are getting really tired and head is now tilted to the right. my arms are sticking to the table and it really bothers me that I'm still pressing the back space and yet I keep doing it. I say my friend earlier and head is tilted to the left side now. right leg over left now. I want to go home and I can't head is itching now on the right side. timer isn't really bothering me now that I think about it. I guess it was the first thing I saw left leg over right eyes getting sleepily as though I'm putting myself to sleep and someone walked in but too lazy to look up cause I'm like in a trans right now. I've been typing forever and I'm still going . and going and going my back still hurts and now head is tilted to right I feel like breathing the way my aunt showed me and while back that can  put my to sleep and I have to sneeze it's break time oh wait. it went back and leg is itching and the breaths are getting bigger and eyes are tired. it feels kinda nice right now and it feels as though it's cold outside and why and I so slouched back right now and I keep on messing up what I'm doing and that's bothering me and I'm still in the same spot and it's now been00 minutes and I'm ready to turn this thing off but I can' because I'm afraid of what will happen. will my grade be determined by the time and my legs have moved once again and arms are still in one spot. I wish it was christmas and I keep thinking in my head what the hell was that guy thinking and there's and itch on the shoulder and I should get it but I don't want to. ok it's bothering me. hand are rough and I'm still typing and I'm wondering what's going to go on after this and that girl that just walked in is loud and I believe blonde and I'm wondering if the girl . itch next ot me is wondering why I won't stop typing. ok time to sit up. I took a 0 sec break and now I'm back sitting up right and I've had about 0 itches already. so what was that guy thinking when he typed the directions of at universal remote? was that even it and damn it I'm still here typing away and I'm getting tired and head is now tilted the other way . I wonder why I do that a lot and my legs just moved and I'm just about done here and now my right eye itches and my right ear does too. ok that's done and now my stomach is itching and I'm thinking how bad my hands are hurting me and damn I've been typing forever and I'm still typing I can't believe I lasted this long and I'm still typing this just goes to show that I'm a dork that loves the computers. ok right arm is about to die and so my time is almost up and it's just done now bye! 
__label__label0 Well today I can't believe I got on the wrong bus. I felt like such a nerd, but oh well I guess everyone has to learn somehow and every one makes mistakes. I can't believe how nice it felt outside today as compared to how hot outside it was yesterday. I am so hungry, I really wish they would have broccoli cheese soup for dinner but I know they won't. I guess I will just have a salad again. Even though I eat salad almost everyday I still cannot lose the 0 pounds I gained over the summer. Its not like anyone can tell but in the back of my mind I just know that I look so much bigger than I used to. When doing the pretesting earlier this week I couldn't believe all the questions they asked about eating. I can't believe that people actually can do that to their bodies. I am thankful that I do not have to worry about my body in that sense. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing right now. He lives in LOCNAME and it is so hard being away from him. I can't believe I have loved him for 0 months. I am so scared that he will stop loving me and all of a sudden realize that he can do so much better and leave me. If I had to see him at tournaments and he had a new girlfriend I don't know what I would do. He means so much to me but no matter how many times he tells me that he loves me and that he misses me I never believe him. He gets mad that I don't trust him but he should blame that on my ex-boyfriend not me. Oh well I guess if it is meant to be than it will be. I am listening to the saddest song called Butterfly Kisses, about a father and daughter. I have missed my dad and dogs the most since I have been gone. My dad is one of my best friends and he always knows exactly what to do. He is the only reason I want to do well in school, just to make him proud is the best feeling in the world. I wish I could tell my dad that I loved him but for some reason we never express those feelings. I know he loves me a lot because he pays for me to go to school and to fly all over the country to do taekwondo, but I wish it would be ok if I could hug him. Instead we always bow and shake hands, that's how you do in in taekwondo. He would do anything to make me happy and he even spent 000 dollars to change my flight so at fall nationals I could spend an extra day with my boyfriend. On the other hand, my mom and I do not get along so well all the time. I love her and when I was sick last weekend she came up and brought me soup and took me shopping, but I don't respect her because she can be very rude to people and when she gets mad she can be mentally abusive. It was horrible living with her when I was 00-00, by the time I was 00 I started fighting back and leaving whenever she would yell at me. My biggest fear besides dying is turning into her and yelling at my kids like she yelled at me. I don't know why my dad still loves her and how he can put up with it, it is not normal how she talks to him or me sometimes. She doesn't understand why I don't want her around my friends or my boyfriend but its because I don't want her to turn into that other person and yell at me in front of them because it really is frightening. My friend PROPNAME just came over to distract me and prevent me from getting an A on this assignment which seems to have no real purpose, but maybe it will after I finish and turn this in. 
__label__label1 Well I decided that I was going to go ahead and get this writing assignment out of my way. Actually, I was just looking for an excuse to put off my reading for my MIS course. I really dread reading that whenever I am finished with this because it is like 00 something pages long and I already have a bad headache. It's pounding as we speak. (or should I say as I type!) Wow, my nose itches a whole bunch. But I guess I would rather it itch than run. Earlier today I was on my way back to the dorms and allergies kicked in really bad. I hope I am not getting sick. That would really suck. I am really excited and nervous all at once about this weekend. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. I haven't seen him in like two weeks and it is probably going to be like a month before I get to see him again. He had his first baseball game today, I wonder how he did. Did he start? Did he hit well? I can't wait to talk to him tonight and get all the details. I'm excited about watching him play on Saturday. Baseball is his true love and I am really happy that he gets to fulfill his dreams by playing in college. However, I hate the idea of having to come home early on Sunday. My reasons for coming home are good, but I just wish I could spend more time in LOCNAME with him and not have to rush back. I mean, why does the dance team tryouts have to be this weekend of all weekends. Every other weekend that I have been here I have tried hard to find excuses and things to do and have had no luck at all except for staying out late and partying. I honestly wanted something productive to do. But now that I have decided to go out of town, they decide to hold dance team tryouts. And that would be what makes me nervous. I have always seemed to accomplish my goals and dreams, especially in the field of dance. But now I am going to be up against so many good girls and I just don't know what to do about that. I really hate the idea of rejection, but if I don't try then I'd never even know what would have came of it. PROPNAME is trying out too and it's going to be horrible living with someone who makes it if she does and I don't. Gosh, I really am nervous. What if they don't like my style or technique. I will be really depressed if I don't make it. I get embarrassed about stupid stuff like this. I wonder why that is. It shouldn't matter what happens, no one should care but me, but somehow I feel ashamed when I don't make things that I go out for. So I just finished balancing my checkbook and I really could use some more money. Sure mom and dad are paying for everything, but it would be nice to go out and do what I want to do when I want to do it and not have to rely on them. Speaking of money, my tuition bill says that I owe $000 and that is so not true. everything was paid and up to date and then I just decided yesterday to add a ballet course. However, the ballet course is only $00,,that is so not equal to $000. I wonder how long I have been writing for. Oh wow, it has already been 00 minutes! How come exercising doesn't seem to go this fast. I feel like when I am running on the treadmill that I have been going for like 00 minutes and it is actually only like 0 minutes or so. That's crazy. I shouldn't have ran the other night. My legs are so sore now and walking up and down these hills many times a day hasn't felt good on these sore muscles. Not to mention, I have had 0 dance classes since then and it is really hard to be limber and flexible when you are this sore. Now my lip itches. This music on television is horrible. I would get up and change the channel but I obviously cannot do that due to this assignment. I am starting to wonder about this course. The lectures are really interesting and class is fun. I have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part. But when it comes down to it, will I really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures. That sort of makes me nervous. The professor is really good and easy to listen to and understand, but I still seem to think that his tests will not so much be the same way. I have a feeling they will be very insightful and difficult and that stresses me out. I've come from a background of like all A's and I do realize things are going to be much harder now that I am in college, but I am not used to making much lower than an A. I am getting really sick of staring at this screen and my fingers are starting to cramp. My position is not very comfortable and I haven't moved in like 00 minutes. It is nice to have peace and quiet in here for once. My roommate seems to not care or respect me much. She likes to do what she wants to do and how and when she wants to do it. And that is fine and all, but when I am trying to sleep I think it's just a little rude when she comes in at like 0 in the morning and is all slamming doors and turning on lights, talking on the computer and on the phone! It's like, I haven't been sleeping very well as it is being in a new environment and all for the first time for this long of a time, then I finally get to sleep and she comes in and wakes me up. Then it takes me like another 00 minutes to fall back to sleep. Gosh I really hate that, but we have been friends for a long time and what do you say to someone like that? I wonder what my mom and dad are doing. I wish I could find PROPNAME's keys or at least find out what happened to them. I mean I just find it so awkward that they just disappeared. My dorm room is not that big and I can't seem to find them anywhere. I feel horrible about her having to take $000 out of her own check book to get an extra key made. Everytime I think about it, I start to get the idea that maybe I accidentally threw them away whenever I took at the trash. I'm thinking about sending her a check with part of the money because I feel so bad for her! Gosh this music on TV is horrible! I like one of her songs, but she just sounds horrible in concert. I don't know how much longer of this I can stand. My shoulders are starting to bother me. It doesn't help out that they were sore to begin with. Oh, something's popping up. I'm through!  
__label__label1 I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about PROPNAME lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to PROPNAME yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 00,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish PROPNAME was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When PROPNAME's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and PROPNAME had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. 
__label__label1 I finally have the time to sit down here and work on this assignment. Today was my first day of work, and it went well. I met a lot of friendly people. I am trying to type while my roommate tries to distract me, punk. What am I going to have for breakfast tomorrow?  What am I going to wear tomorrow?  Is it going to rain tomorrow?  I really want to barbeque and have a cold one. The only class I have tomorrow is Integral Calculus, so that's cool. My arms are somewhat sore from working out right now, and my mind will not stop thinking about the steak that I want to cook. I have the A0 marinade ready to marinade my steak. The season all and lemon pepper. I'm hungry. What all am I going to have for supper?  I know that I will have the steak, but should I have a salad or pasta with it or both?  Often times I stop and think about how my mind wonders around from thought to thought. My friends tell me that I always just from one idea to another. My roommate is going to cook his supper. I don't think that that is some sort of 'disease' or illness, I believe it's just that my mind thinks a lot. Will I be rich and have the house that I have always wanted; Will I have the money to retire early in life and buy that house on the lake for my father. That is my goal in life. To retire early. I want to be retired at the age of about 00 so that I can repay my parents for everything that they have done for me. Man, this time thing is going soooooo slow. I'm on 0 min and 00 sec. I know after this assignment I plan to have dinner and do some dishes, but then what am I going to do?  I have the option of working on work or ironing, sleeping, calculus. so many options. what to choose. The weather is awesome right now. A nice cool breeze is blowing through with the rain. I wish I did not have to work on a damn apple computer at work. I am capable of functioning on the MacOS, but would much rather use a pc. 0 mind 00 sec. I wish I would have had time to have seen some of the documentaries on TV  today about sept. 00. O well, my parents are planning on visiting me this weekend. My mom wanted to see me and my aunt wants to come up to do some shopping. That means that I am going to have to wait until next weekend to go out to LOCNAME LOCNAME if I get the chance to. I know. I'll eat, shower, do my work, calculus, then sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I can do some reading for mythology and MIS 000 maybe. Na, I'll finish the cal since it will be do tomorrow night. I need to get that done, but I knew that I had this assignment to do first, so I decided to take care of this. Who decided to name a bottle Captain PROPNAME's Parrot Bay"?  I feel like watching The General's Daughter. Good movie. I wonder. hopefully a girl I met at orientation and I can get together sometime when we are away from school. We've been tied up with a lot lately. She is beautiful, nice, funny. and so on, but no relationships for me for a while. I feel that I need to enjoy myself right now. Now the time seems to be going faster. crazy 00 min. 00 sec. That food that my roommate is cooking has an awesome aroma, and that damn lightening. better not mess up my computer because that would piss me off. I don't know what I am going to do for spring break this year. I think I should go out and enjoy it and party again at LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. actually I would only like to go there if I can DJ there. My friend and I were super close to DJing during this past spring break, but I would rather go to LOCNAME or something. Crazy how so many college students travel countless hours to go to a beach during this time. I understand it's a lot of fun and all, but for me. I lived an hour away, so I took my computer and bumped some jamz while I was out at the beach. I remember being on the balcony, pretty smashed, and looking at the waves roll in. The hotels lining the shoreline and nothing but a beach view, it was great. Then at some place called ORGNAME ORGNAME, some crazy chick from LOCNAME LOCNAME jumped into the hot tub fully clothed and took some off. Girls Gone Wild was going to be there. U know, I think it's stupid that the beaches are getting tougher on underage drinking during this time. I understand that they want for people to be sage, but if they don't take their economic situation into consideration. they are going to loose a lot of people. I was reading the paper one time and it reported that LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME lost a great deal of spring breakers. I'm sure partly because of the tough laws. They could make so much more money if they created a SEMI safe environment. but let people have some fun. It's like 0th street. punks are extremely strict on underage drinking, but I know the law . whatever 00 minutes. almost out of time. sorry. My steak is waiting for me. and I am tired. Still trying to think of what to have for breakfast tomorrow. I'll think of something. well. think everything is planned out. Can't wait to party this weekend and all. it'll be cool. 
__label__label1 okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 00 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem000. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 0. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        
__label__label1 Well I'm sitting here typing on the computer in carother's lounge and a girl just came in as I was writing. She looks foreign of course everyone here is foreign or Asian dissent. It smell like old rubber in here I hate that smell. I don't won't to write that paper for Religious Studies. I hate writing so much but my mom says I'm so good at it. She always thinks she knows what I'm good at or what I like best. that is one reason why I came to this school because she thought it was the perfect place for me. I don't know if it is or isn't but I haven't made any new friends yet mainly because of sheri she never wants to do anything she is so anti social. I am going to move into Jester next year  I feel she is holding me back  she never wants to associate with anyone and she never watches tv. I mean hardly ever good thing I turned the tv on this morning or I would have never found out about PROPNAME PROPNAME or johnny cash dying. last night right when the new was about to come on she flips off the tv. I need to know what's going on the world. PROPNAME's birthday is today I forgot she is so sweet I should have called early this morning like I was going to  I wasn't even tired  but sheri once again  "do u want to wait until she is up" and of course I had second thoughts and decided not to I should just call her after this writing thing by myself but that would make sheri upset I had it all planned out  we would be the first to wake her up and wish her on a happy birthday. I remember when I was a freshmen and was going to wish every body in our class from catholic school and call them up in the morning but I chickened out once again I don't know why I guess no I don't know why. I wonder what's ORGNAME doing  I hate him so much but I love him so much to  he lies entirely to much just to get girls to sleep with him but his touch is so good pennebaker class is going to be so hard  why is she so loud on her phone she looks like a complete dork. pennebaker's class is going to be so hard all of my classes are. out of all the types of test we had to do. it had to be analogies  my worst kind of concept I remember doing them in ms almanza's class they would be on the green chalkboard everyday and I hated them everyone got them but me. My sat score was low because of those stinking analogies. I remember getting my first F in her class but I can't believe she died I can't believe john ritter died she was so mean yet so nice and encouragelble I remember making those X-mas ornaments that we still used today we made homemade play doh and had to mold them into something I didn't know what to do I was so uncreative everybody had something neat so I resorted to making breakfast items  (perfect breakfast for a perfect teacher  I said)  I wonder because of that man's death I thinking of ms almazna death and the times in 0nd grade. PROPNAME cash didn't even win the VMA award instead thay gave it to justin timberlake  hell probably get about a dozen more awards while johny cash is dead sometimes I don't know society does the stupidest things sometimes  the jocks in that class are completely uncute I wonder how they will do in that class. they look dumb the jocks in our class were smart and dumb. I wonder what sports they play I want to ask so bad. I wish I lived in jester maybe I could find a new best friend someone like melodi she is already moved on and is having a great time she probably wouldn't if I hadn't told her to go out to dinner with those people. I won't to find someone like the other black girls in my dorm have I want a new friend to go somewhere with not like that black girl I thought she is kinda off what she had on today o my god. and binta is nice but kinda of rude  I knew this would be fun I don't want to stop 
__label__label1 ow. I just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. I bump intot stuff a lot. I think that it's because I don't pay much attention or maybe because I'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about  the wall in front of me. I ramble a lot too and I don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. I've told the people at the management place and I don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and I'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if I don't like having the lights on?  what if I'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way I can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing I'm not like that. I don't type as well as I wish I did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. I forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, I hope it's not overdue. I already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when I told him I scratched the car?  it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when I messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and I don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if I ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when I know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because I have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. I don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and I don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. I like sharing my opinion. I even like it when people get mad or offended. I don't know why, I just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. I can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid I thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what I think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that I think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but I would never tell her that, and I certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. I think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because I only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if I can't talk to you I don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, I'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be EVIL, god forbid. God forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. I hate stupid people. I'm sorry, I'm a mean person. I don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. I hate when people ask me how I like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, I hate asking people stuff like that so I don't and I expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that I hate that. they don't know me there's no way they COULD know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. I am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. I wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do I mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. I don't think I have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then I feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. I think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up 
__label__label1 I was just typing for like 0 minutes and all the stuff I just typed erased. So now I'm really pissed off. I was writing about my boyfriend and how I miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. I am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. I am so excited. I really don't like it up here I just have to deal with it and get used to it. I get so happy when I get to go home on the weekends. So you could say I am living for the weekends. That is bad I guess but I don't know, I just have to get used to it. I am talking to my friend right now. She is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. I wish she would just be herself all the time. I wish that some of my friends would come up here. I am ready to go home. I miss my family and especially my mother. She would comfort me right now. I need to read my bible. I am so bored right now. And I'm tired because I stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. I wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. I am so bored. My friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. I hate when she lies. She does that all the time. I wish she wouldn't do that. I wish my friend PROPNAME would come up here and go to college with me. I have already made up my mind that if I don't like it by the end of the semester I am going to transfer. I will try to stick it out though. I have calculus homework due Thursday and I am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems I don't know how to do. My calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. That is horrible. I can't wait till I get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and I will be able to understand stuff better. Dang!  I didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. I have like nine more minutes. I am so bored. As soon as I finish this I am going to sleep. No!  After I talk to my boyfriend. He is coming up here on the 00th and I can't wait. I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder what he is doing right now. My daddy gets on my nerves. He always has something smart to say. He can't never just let stuff be. I wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. I am really glad I have church members that care about me. I have received so many phone calls. It really encourages me to know that I have people praying for me. I have to keep reminding myself that I want to be a pharmacist and that I have to do what I have to do to get it. I am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and I will do good and that I won't fail any classes. I want to talk to my boyfriend now, but I am not going to call him until I finish this. Twenty minutes is long, and I didn't know it could be so long. I guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because If I didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. I really miss my mother. I'm about to read my bible, so I can gain some encouragement. I think I may call my mother before I go to bed or not. I need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that I am and accept my responsibility. I am about  to call my boyfriend. I love him and hope we get married right after I finish school, if we last that long. If not, I wish the best for him in life. But I think we would be good together. We are good together now. Except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. I can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. And my family. I'm ready to see everyone. I love being at home. I wish when I was in high school I didn't always want to leave home 
__label__label0 Today has been an absolutely great day, except for the weather. Austin has extremely crazy weather. One minute, it was bright and sunny outside, and the next it was raining cats and dogs!  Of coarse, it continued to do this for the rest of the day. Now that I am in my dorm room, I am beginning to think about what my mom and other friends are doing. It makes me a little sad to think that I am here and cannot be with them. Normally, I do not get homesick, but for the last couple of days I have been missing everyone extremely. I am sure that they are all having fun where they are, but I feel sure that they must miss me too. I just got done talking to my mom, and she said that it is very sunny down in Corpus Christi right now. I miss the excruciating sun that comes along with the cool breeze there. Now, my roommate just walked in, and I really want to go outside because she let some hot air in. It is so cold in this room. Our thermos stat is in the room across the hall from ours, and the girls in that room will not change it. They keep telling us that it is so hot in there room, but I cannot stand it. It is so cold in our room; I always walk around with a blanket. In Corpus, it is never cold, not even in the winter time. It truthfully only get down to about sixty degrees in the winter. It's crazy!  I bet my friend PROPNAME is having so much fun at LOCNAME LOCNAME She calls me every couple of days. In Corpus, we were very close, so for her not to call me that much means she is very busy and having a great time. I wonder a lot about how all my other friends are doing. Another one of my best friends just started at LOCNAME. I hope she likes it. I know her classes will be hard. I do like it here though. I am just beginning to make friends, and I think as time goes on it will get easier and easier. At least, that is what everyone tells me. I went to draw for a football wrist band today. My number was terrible. There is absolutely no way that I am going to get tickets. I wish I could have though. It would have been so much fun! I am not a big football fan, but because ORGNAME is such a big rival, it would have been exciting!  Gosh, it is so cold in here. I feel like my fingers are going to fall off. I hope the rest of the year it is not going to be like this. My roommate is now studying so I will have to be quiet for the rest of the night, but that's ok. I just go outside to talk on the phone or downstairs to watch tv. I believe that is what I will do after I finish this assignment because I really do not have much more homework to do. Actually, just kidding; I have a big economics quiz that I need to study for after I am done. Oh well another fun filled night of homework. This school is much more difficult than my high school. I miss the simplicity of high school. it wsa so much fun. Ok, my time is up so good bye. 
__label__label0 ok. so I am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing I don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although I don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, I have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when I sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. I'm hungry. but I don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, I can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that I am hungry now. I want to eat now. maybe something small when I get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. I can wait. I guess. I wonder if they think its cheap that I'm inviting them over on monday. this way I order the cheap monday madness pizza. but I guess its not really a big deal. I was going to invite them over soon. I want my computer up and running asap. I can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. I hope bilal and them come tomorrow. I mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. I smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, I guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. I mean, lots of people do smoke, but I just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. I don't think I was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was I? oh well. that's what I'm doing. haha I can't believe I was so stupid today. I have been going to urdu class at 00 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if I had gotten there right on time, I would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing I went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! I really didn't think that she would let me sign in. I came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, I have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. I have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. I guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. I don't think I have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as I had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. I like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and I'm upset with raza. I didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. I don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. I'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like I have been typing for twenty minutes straight. I guess this wasn't so bad after all. I wonder what happens after my time is up. will I not be able to type anything else? well, I will find out in 00 seconds. now after this, I got to pick up my I'D from the business school, then. then I dunno. I could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or I could go home and study". but that will never work. hmm, I think I just answered my own question. 
__label__label1 I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. PROPNAME this song by PROPNAME PROPNAME reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. "  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  PROPNAME, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back PROPNAME. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 00?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over PROPNAME PROPNAME! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you PROPNAME. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. PROPNAME, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special PROPNAME was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor PROPNAME said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can PROPNAME be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive PROPNAME. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not PROPNAME that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having PROPNAME too. Hehe. 
__label__label1 I'm not quite sure what to write about, and I highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper! It makes me nervous to turn in a paper that I won't have time to proofread or check over. One of my English teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper! Luckily my teachers aren't like that and this is the first paper I've had to write so far. Which is a good thing, I'm definitely not complaining. It is also the first actual homework assignment I have had, the rest is just reading and reading and more reading! Luckily most of it is interesting. I know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework, but I don't think so. It isn't harder because there is more time to accomplish things in. the. Besides, teachers aren't so anal here. Maybe it's just UT, but I love it! I love the liberal attitude! Anyway, my roommate is due back at any second. Everytime I hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way, I think it is her. It's a bit distracting, although I guess in a way I already am distracted. I just don't know what to write about! I really hope this paper isn't graded on content! But PROPNAME, my roommate, is really nice. She thinks she is a witch, which I thought was incredibly weird, but whatever. I haven't seen anything weird since I've been here. Unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is. She did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met! Isn't that weird? I can't imagine that relationship going anywhere. But it makes me feel glad that I have PROPNAME. He is been my boyfriend for two years, and now that we are in different cities, it's hard! I think he is taking it harder than I am, but I don't know how to help him! I guess that if the situation was reversed, I would be freaking out too. It's just that I have so many things to do here, that I can't talk to him every single time he wants to. Maybe things will improve with time. I finally found the lyrics to PROPNAME's song called ?Only Time. ? It really has a great message, although almost all of her songs do. As the title implies, she talks about how only time knows everything. Time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away. Knowing that is great, it's just hard. Kind of like the saying ?easier said than done. ? It's hard waiting for things! Not material things necessarily, but for success and happiness and similar things. I guess that's what everyone wants; happiness. I'm scared that I won't find it in my future work. Even though I love helping people and I know Social Work is a great thing, social workers make less than $00,000 a year! It makes me wonder if I have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 00 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe PROPNAME's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! 
__label__label0 I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at LOCNAME because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to ORGNAME and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at LOCNAME so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 00 more sec. blah blah    00 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. 
__label__label1 I'm writing a stream of consciousness paper, yeah! well, my friend PROPNAME is sitting next to me submitting his calculus homework. I'm wondering if I will have more success when I submit mine. PROPNAME's a good guy but never helps out with calculus. some friend. I wish that this thing was over. 00 minutes is looking like a long time. I didn't think twenty minutes could be so long. I guess it's all relativity. If I was on a beach in cancun 00 minutes would go by in the blink of an eye. but here, no. I'm hear for eternity, or twenty minutes whichever comes first. the internet is down in my room so I have to use this damn facility at the base of my dorm, man this sucks. the damn airwave guy was supposed to come down and take care of the internet problem but it turns out he doesn't give a rat's ass about the internet or my calculus or my stream of consciousness, man he sucks big time. keep thinking about PROPNAME wonder what she is doing. wonder how many guys she is been with since rejecting me. damn, stay positive, it's the only way to get through boring times. shouldn't smoke anymore either. smoking's bad and yet it's so damn good. man good thing I don't smoke or I might be enjoying a good nicotine buzz right now. what's the deal with PROPNAME anyway? I mean I'm not attracted to her anymore because she reaks of desperation I mean that bugs me. why does she always have to guilt trip me, fooling around with her is like a full time job. wish I could have gone to jack in the box even though that food will make me fat. hannah said that food would make her fat. maybe we're both right. I hate the cafeteria food here. today I couldn't stomach any of it. got to make a check out to tom for 00 dollars for the ceiling fans that weren't even put in the right way. that dude with the messed up teeth installed the improperly  the first time anyway, they almost crushed john and marissa. what a shit weekend, john had someone to do and I didn't haha. clever pun. clever reminds me of that one girl I met at the ORGNAME house and we talked macbeth and I got her number but that didn't stop her from not returning my calls, I need to find some way to get a flask into the football games that way the buzz doesn't wear off and I can keep on buzzing baby. yeah I remember the time on this very computer I walked by and some Australian dude was looking at the most obscene porn I've ever seen in my life. I wonder what everyone else's stream of consciousness papers look like. I wonder if mine is ore or less neurotic than everyone else. I really should get a girlfriend like my sweet mate tom the golden boy. he is the golden boy because he wins at fucking everything. smart, good looking, athletic, in a word I hate his guts. but I don't really he is my friend I just wish the playing field was a little more even so that I could get some females for whatever reason. the guy is so lucky, he is rich and he doesn't really have to make grades in college and he has enough money to join a fucking frat and it pisses me off because the frat guys wanted me too but I have neither the money nor the time with school because some of us have to make the grade just to get a decent job and make a little money. I thought college would be so cool, but it absolutely sucks. I mean, why did I have this delusion that college would be so damn great, it's just like high school. which was just like middle school with cars. man, life is truly what you make of it. On the one hand you got fewer people hassling you, on the other hand you have a lack of support. man I wish we hadn't got cable in our room, now I especially don't want to study, I need mary jus t called me. better not answer. she is kinda weird, maybe she got an OU UT wristband, yeah well, sorry I didn't get you your I'D mary, you shouldn't have left it over here. I wish I had a car and also some more socks because when you've got socks you don't have to do as much laundry. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such a bitch, all through middle school me and my friends would have killed to get some" from her. but now that she has that new show on mtv that's all reality and stuff I realize what an absolute hose beast she is, man she sucks big time well its getting near the end of this I wonder where the research page is so I can get some credit hours and not fail the damn class. I suppose that 's it 0 v sorry dude I only signed up for twenty. 
__label__label1 what should I write about? I wish that I was not so slow at typing. I wonder how long I have typed for . man I haven't typed that long only 0 minute and 00 seconds. I wonder how much longer this is going to be. my phone is ringing. oh its amy I don't feel like talking to her where is ter there it is yeah she really gets annoying sometimes I really care about her but sometimes I can't stand it man I still have only been oops accidentally typed an m what should I write about what do I like I like baseball I still haven't watch espn to find out what happened with the astos I hope they are still in first place what to write about what to oops man I wish that I was better at typing they are talking about people famous on tv that are reflecting on what they were doing at age 00 man I'm almost 00 00 seems like it wasc so long ago jessica simpson is fine she is talking on tv right now I wish that she was my girlfriend she is really fine man 00 minutes seems a lot longer than I thought or hoped it would be this seems like it is taking forever man I hope it rains tomorrow so I don't have to work work is getting worse and worse every day that I work I just want to get it over with so that I can get paid I remember when I had to do one of these things in elementary school I wonder what grade it was maybe it was in middle school with mrs webber she was a really goods teacher I wonder what ever happened to her I wonder if she still works at trinity she was a hard teacher but a very good one I wonder how much longer man I am almost finished oh I am   
__label__label0 this is my first writing assignment. I'm watching cosby on tv. I have a headache. I've had a headache most of today. I woke up and was still dead tired even after 0 hours of sleep. I had a stomach ache and felt like I was going to be sick. I had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so I got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good I think for breakfast. I think from now on on mwf I'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. I was supposed to have a study group tonight but I called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but I don't really need it. I think I'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. I had calculus in high school but got a 0 on the AP test so I'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since I'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. I was thinking about switching majors to psych cause I really enjoyed everything I learned in high school when I took it. I don't know if I'll switch over though yet. I'm liking me ee000 and 000 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day I've felt like crap and I miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since I've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 0 0/0 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. I'd come home every weekend if I had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. I'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. I don't care about the experience. I'm here to learn and I do that during the week. I do all my homework when I need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't I come home and spend my time with the one person I want to spend time with. well I know people here that have offered me rides so I can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause I spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on I'll get rides home from other people so I can spend my time with who I want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. I feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how I feel. I love my mom and everything, but I'm not really close to her at all, and I've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and I am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. I'm so close to mariko and I love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. I've been thinking about going next summer. I'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 0000 dollars for the ticket and I'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then I've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. I really want to go. my mom's really against the religion I've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and I hate how she feels. but through religion I've learned how to deal with all these feelings and I'm comforted now and I forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. I'm kind of tired and I still have a headache. I want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time I checked, and right now I don't want to walk back down there 0 floors to find out. I don't' feel like a sprite either, I could go down to san jac again. I think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. I need to move around more or something I guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and I can't stand it. I put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and I put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so I guess I won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but I don't think it matters. oh well. I have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. I like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. I miss her so much. I hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. I don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. I wish I could help her more but there's not much I can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason I want to be home still. so I can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and I call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 000 or church or school during the day and then I have classes at certain times so I can't just leave and call her. but I'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so I don't think I'll get a couple calls in this week. I'll call on the weekend though since I won't be going home this weekend. hopefully I meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. I seem to be the youngest person there. and I'm already not a talkative person, so I think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 00 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well. 
__label__label0 this is one of the most interesting assignments I've had. Frisbee tomorrow I'll be late. I'm homesick and a bad typer is that the right word oh well All my friends and family enjoying themselves without me (sigh) this getting used to college is a little more difficult than I imagined but I guess that I always have trouble starting something new my legs are tired I ran 0 miles and played Frisbee When I started elementary school I cried and clung to my dad's leg ORGNAMEn't remember middle school Funny how I can remember something farther away than something more recent maybe elementary was more traumatic. Then high school I got really tiny because I think I had a nervous stomach I can hear the girl next to me' s headphones It must be a foreign language We have to do that in French I'm finally getting hungry I thought I never would I need to work out more It is kind of depressing to have once worked out on a team five days a week twice a day with a whole bunch of people now I have to make myself do stuff that is not as fun I go by myself to the gym and to swim at least I found frisbee except they're a little more advanced than me but the practices aren't a s strenuous and as frequent as my old swim practices My room mates sick puking all night I keep washing my hands and the door knob every thing she touches It makes me nervous when people are sick I don't want to catch it and get my life off schedule I mean heck it just got into some kind of routine then I'd go and get sick miss class miss practice and have to get the notes from someone and not fall to far behind that makes me nervous  I used to get sick all the time when I swam every winter I would get some kind of 0- 0 day flu and it would usually mess everything up My training for the meets especially I was so frustrated sometime s I would try and convince myself I wasn't sick and I would just keep going as if nothing was wrong and then bam I couldn't do it any longer I would be so weak and tired I had just made it worse Nothing like making a problem even worse Only three minutes to go and I'm hungry I think I will have an apple they taste mmmm I like to eat fruit I had a boyfriend that pretty much didn't eat fruit or vegetable he liked mashed potatoes and gravy chicken fried steak and all that stuff is fine but you have to balance or your going to die to soon probably unless you have good genes people should take care of themselves         
__label__label0 I am downloading stuff on kazaa. I've saved so much money this way. I need to make sure my grammar, punctuation, and spelling are correct. I have a basketball (plush) on my table, although I never play with it. Yeah, my web cam sucks. It's old. But free. My roommate is cool. He is sitting there doing the survey. I had a good day today. I want to go to the church next to PROPNAME. Probably this sunday. Yeah. Sunday sounds good. 0000 is my room number. I have a song stuck in my head right now. I can't remember the name of it. actually, I didn't know the name to begin with. Its a rap song. I need to charge my Palm m000. And take a shower. That would feel good. My mouth is dry. I need something to drink. Now I need to piss. It's really dark in here. This apple juice is not good for my teeth. I think there's sugar in it. Not good. Wow, it's only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. That sucks. I'm getting bored. I want to play some computer games. Too bad I'm stuck with this assignment. Oh, now I have a different rap song stuck in my head. I think I'm obsessed with them. I remember listening to this song a few hours ago before dinner. I was at my friends house if I can remember correctly. Humans are funny. I need to spend my taco bell coupon. Coupon or Coupon? I've heard it pronounced both ways. I wonder when my parents are going to call? Probably soon after 0? Or maybe 0:00? Haha, I just remembered something from dinner. My friend was taking pictures of girls with his phone camera. The asterisk looks like a snowflake. I noticed that I like to stand my chair up on it's front two legs. Well, that is if it had legs. It's more like a bar on both sides and connected in the middle. At least its comfortable, unlike the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Yeah. LOCNAME LOCNAME. I went on a field trip there. No, wait. It was LOCNAME on the LOCNAME. Maybe that is close. I don't know. I like the way you do it right thar. A line from the song I have stuck in my head. Geez, its been 0:00 only. Like I said earlier, this sucks. Damn, I'm typing too fast and my grammar is messing up. My speaker system and subwoofer rock. My hands hurt from typing so much. I should study more. I haven't even opened any of my books yet. Oh well, the weekend is coming up. I can do most of my stuff then. I hope I'm not going to be like this later on in the year. It's a bad sign. I hope I don't get lost in my homework assignments. I can't seem to find the Philosophy 000 website. Not good. Yeah. I got a nice view from here. I need to email my parents and send them more pictures. Awww, how sweet of me. I never realized how long 00 minutes can be. Wow. It's like. long. Yeah, anyways, I feel kind of weird talking to myself. Weird? Or is it spelled wIErd? I will have to look that up later. I'm sore from sitting like this. Well, I only have 0 more items on my download list in ORGNAME Lite K++. If you read this, get the K++ edition, not Kazaa, not Diet Kazaa, and not Kazaa Lite. K++ &gt; *. Yuuuhhhhhhhhh. I'm bored. I need to shower. I already mentioned that didn't I? Awesome, only 0 0/0 minutes to go. This sucks. It's boring. I'm not thinking of anything. My neck hurts. I don't smell anything out of the ordinary. I guess I got used to the smell of my room. 0 more minutes! I don't think I can last that long. I don't want to go to prison. Heh, it's not a confession or hinting at anything I've ever done. I'm a good guy. Yeah. Good. Maybe too good. Nah. 0 0/0 minutes to go. Wow, I'm really slowing down. This would probably take up 0 to 0 pages in ORGNAME Word, 00 point font, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's kind of sad how I can know this. I will test it out whenever I finish the 00 minutes. I also need to test out w(ei/ie)rd. SAT format baby. Yeahhhhh! 00 seconds! I think I will just wait it out. I'm so happy now. YAY! 
__label__label1 I am beginning to write this assignment and I'm thinking that is a pretty big waste of time. I'm already bored and I don't like it. I can smell the bread I got at la madelines and it smells pretty good. I don't normally eat there so it was a treat and I was there with a good friend so it was pretty fun. my friend/roommate just flushed the toilet and I think it sucks down pretty hard. alright only eighteen minutes to go. the more I smell the bread the more I want to eat it. it smells really good. the tv is on right now and it is on mtv, the voice of our generation. I was watching a show on christina aguilara and realized how gorgeous she really was when she dresses normally. man I'm hungry!  I got to say I want to pierce my lip. the more I think about it the more I want to do it. I think it would so cool. and I want a tattoo. too bad my dad is anal about stuff like that. oh well, one of these days. we better beat the hell out of arkansas next saturday or I'll be pissed. my friend made me laugh because he heard this commercial for the dumbest movie ever, malibu's most wanted. I could go for some cereal. my mom's in europe on a cruise right now. queer eye for the straight guy is the dumbest excuse for television ever. what a waste of time that was. they don't even dress like straight guys. they are really gay and there style sucks. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a funny guy I met him in new york. it is weird how peoples minds drift. I wish I could be a professional assassin. not even a ninja assassin, just one with a cool silenced gun. I don't know why. it just seems cool. to take care" of evil men. like in the boondock saints, the greatest movie ever. I hope I get to run track in the spring and I make the team. that would be like a dream come true. I would be a college athlete. that would be neat. and all the ladies love that. I think music is a great thing. I hope I find a bassist for my man while I'm here and we can play a show here at emo's. this is taking a lot longer than I thought it would. beyonce knowles is a good looking' woman. I don't know why she likes jay-z. to be famous would be nice, but to be a doctor would be nicer because I earned that. good charlotte sucks. they are terrible live and I don't get why people like them. the guitarist isn't even good. I'm half way done. that is nice to know. my mind is being strained. the texans one today and they beat the dolphins. that is awesome because some thought the dolphins would win the super bowl. we'll see about that. texas football rules. my old high school one its first game of the season yesterday and they did well. my little brother one his first high school of his career and he was pretty proud. He is on the a team and that is a big deal. blah blah, that is what my mind thinks. its neat to see what people can think of. I need to buy some milk for my room. I could go fro some cocoa-cocoa dyno bytes. they are so good, and chocolaty. mmmmmm. delicious. instant messaging is an interesting concept in these connected times of ours. that would suck to be a worm. have no legs and what not, I need to get xp for my computer so I have word, excell and power point. that would be nice. only six minutes to go. I don't know why people love asses so much. its kinda gross when people think about what they really are. chris rock is pretty find. he just has a really big mouth and I'm surprised he hasn't gotten beaten up. it was PROPNAME PROPNAME's birthday not too long ago and he is really funny. I just started showing my friend how to play the guitar and she is doing pretty well. probably because she knows how to play the violin. david blaine is the most amazing street magician ever. the olsen twins are worth over a billion dollars. rock music is the best sort of music because I can get into it more I think. rap isn't real music. just like good charlotte. I like evanescence because that girl is hot and linkin park is good because they are different. the white stripes suck however because that girl can't drum to save her life. it is interesting to see how people interact. I don't know why. maybe that is why I want to be a psychiatrist. I'm trying to spell correctly on this and I don't know why. maybe so you can understand what is being typed on this crazy assignment. linkin park won the best rock video award. it was interesting. I don't know why. that band has a lot of asians in it. PROPNAME is a well received band because they are good. I could never be a typical rock star because I can't think I could be that mean to people. 
__label__label0 I just got out of psychology class like an hour ago so I thought I would do this paper while I am still in the thinking mode. I thought what pennebaker said about how students new to the college experience, like myself are under lots of stress. that is true. and how they are more prone to get sick when they go home because their stress is relieved. but I think I am sick right now because I've been coughing a lot and my nose is all clogged up. I think it's from the air conditioning in my dorm. but I'm not supposed to be sick now, right? anyways I've been here in austin for almost three weeks now and I have had lots of new experiences but I am beginning to get homesick. I miss my mom, dad, and sisters, and the city of houston. I am glad that I have friends from high school here that I can lean on. just ate dinner. it was really good and now I'm really full. my dance class starts tomorrow, can't wait for that. I don't like sleeping on the top bunk, don't sleep very well, been taking lots of naps. probably cause I stay up too late and have to get up early. lots of traffic noises outside. can hear buses. reminds me of when I got on the completely wrong bus the first week of school. I met a guy and have been hanging out with him. he seems really cool. I want to us to be friends but scared he might want to be more than friends. just adds to all the stress. I really need to be at the library studying right now. I think I will go when I finish this. just learned how to play racquet ball the other day. it's really fun, but very exhausting. I am so sore. also my legs hurt from walking around campus so much. I am really out of shape. everybody is concerned about the freshman fifteen but I really don't care if I gain fifteen pounds. it is highly unlikely since I eat like a bird, but I would be okay with the extra weight. I'm not going home until the end of september which means I will be going five weeks without seeing my family. I've never gone for more than a week without seeing them. can't wait to go home and see them and go to a pat green concert in houston. seems like not many people here listen to country music which is mostly what I listen to, although I do like other kinds of music. my twenty minutes is up. got to go! 
__label__label0 Okay. this keyboard is weird. the buttons are all flat and wide and the mouse is part of the laptop. ergh this is going to be hard to get used to. why does ORGNAME make their E crooked? Does it make it look cool to them?  Ugh. I have to stop backspacing that's not the point of this thing. ooh. someone's on their I'M. I haven't talked to PROPNAME in about 0 days. I wonder if she is annoyed that I still call at least twice a week. I need to get out more . I've only made 0 friends since I've been here. well not really, I guess PROPNAME and that weird girl across the hall from PROPNAME count. I haven't started getting friendly with anyone in any of my classes and that's going to bad when, my foot is asleep. studying crap needs to get done. Why does PROPNAME always sleep. I have to walk on eggshells if she is constantly napping. isn't the 00 minutes up yet?  This is taking forever and my hands are colder I wonder if that saying about guys being turned on when their hands are cold is true. This chair's uncomfortable. At least I organized my junk some. I need to buy paper towels next time I go to the store. I'm kind of hungry but I've already had about 000 calories today. these keys are so weird. I keep missing letters because they're not where they're supposed to be. good I wrote the right type of they're and not their. I hate when people mix up their spellings. I probably did in this thing. I hope no one reads it. I have nothing of substance ever going on in my head. I like the clicky noises the laptop makes. I wonder if I'll be able to connect wirelessly now that I bought that card thing. I'll have to find those place things where wireless can be used. I bet the school lied about them being almost everywhere. wankers. ugh I keep hitting the mouse thing. it'll take forever to get used to this thing. 0 and a half minutes to go. come oonnnnn. I don't want to do this anymore. at least I won't have to do a research paper for this class. and the writing seems to be easy so far. My shoulders hurt and my fingers are still cold. Will these people please stop loitering in front of our door. so freaking rude. Now the pain's spreading to my neck. I need a break . wonder if I'm getting carpel tunnel Not again. Damn computer. why did I want a laptop so much. not worth it. stupid ORGNAME . need to stretch. 0 minutes. I have to do French after this. why is that class taking up so much of my time. I need more free time. why can't it be like it was the first week that was nice. Why does. oh crap this is showing up on-line. people are going to read this. What kind of loser would waste their time doing that. I sure as hell don't have time for anything much more than homework and trying to get in a nap somewhere. How can people sleep on the grass? Don't bugs fly in their ears and noses. don't they worry about the sun damage they're. am I the only one around here who uses sun block. why am I only writing in question form?  stop. stop. thinking about my fingers which are still cold and pretty dry looking. Now what was that? What are you doing computer don't disconnect my I'M! Damn you, I didn't tell you to do that. piece of crap. Still hungry maybe I can type and reach over for a granola bar at once. Do circus people ever get bored entertaining ungrateful idiots?  Do PeTA and those SpCA people check up on them to make sure they don't mistreat the tigers and elephants and stuff. Oh almost done thank you. woohooo!  Continue writing my butt! 
__label__label1 Hey what is up. Just writing my homework. I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction ". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those "teen movies" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 0 minutes 00 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 0 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 0 min 0 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 00 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 00 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, LOCNAME, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but PROPNAME is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in LOCNAME. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the ORGNAME would win only 0 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 00 min 00 sec. Today is Wednesday. 0/0/00. September 00 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 0/00 was a drug deal gone bad with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Heroin is a major export out of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. The LOCNAME Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the LOCNAME LOCNAME in 0000. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. PROPNAME is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 000. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 00 min 00 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done 
__label__label1 I'm just sitting on the computer. I miss my sister and family and I want to go home soon but I have so much homework to do and my first exam on Friday. I'm so scared bout the exam because I'm not at all good at science and I really want a good grade but don't really understand what's going on. and biology is so hard man I'm totally lost and the teacher goes so fast that I feel more lost. I don't know if ill ever get to fully catch up to where I'm supposed to be. I can't wait to relax this weekend though and go out with friends and just have fun because this week as been kind of stressful. I really want to meet some more indian people here so I can get to know more freshman and find a guy soon. I really don't need one but it be nice to have one. man I'm so full from eating. I don't think I can eat anything now for the whole day. but I'm getting so tired of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME food. I'm really craving some indian food man I miss it so much. I really miss my little sister too and her hyper and cheerful self. she always brought a smile to my face. I really need to go study but I'm too lazy to get up now. I miss all my friends back in dallas and the only way I can talk to them is online so my room mate always makes fun of me because I'm always sitting on the computer. gosh shane is so mean to me man. I actually think I might like him but he lives in new york n that's too far but he is such a nice guy most of the time but can be such a punk. man its only like 00 minutes now I have to write for another 00 more. haha. I love psych class man n I think its really cool especially because I think its so interesting but it really sucks that I didn't pass the AP exam. chem class is cool because she does so many experiments but I wish I knew more of what was going on in there. man there are so many smart people in my class that I feel so dumb. I graduated #0 and was #0 for 0 yrs but feel so dumb here because so many people are so much smarter. I really want to get up and feel smart again like I did in high school. haha. wow its getting really cold in the room now but my room mate is always hot. she is weird. hehe. man I can't believe its already 000 I got so much to do. the days have gone by so fast since I got here! its flying by faster than I can even handle or take in man! I want to go to the study lounge later to meet up with all the new freshman but I know I won't get anything done if I do. but ill think ill go by anyway. hehe. man I really miss going to my orthodox church. the catholic one here is ok but I really miss my service. I think I'm getting home sick now but I love college life. my parents shelter me way to much and I didn't have much independence and that's what I love about college. I can make my own decisions but only problem is that its harder to discipline myself without them here and to actually do school work. hehe. alright well time is almost up now so I think I should stop writing. man I write a lot. and now its off to study. I don't feel like it but I guess I should. hehe. man I can't type properly anymore because of all the slang and abbreviations I use on the internet. haha. ugh guys really piss me off sometimes. they r so stupid and pick fights to make u feel bad then say they're just kidding. ughhh. anyways I should really go study now. 
__label__label1 This is my first year here at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with. At the ORGNAME ORGNAME I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. I miss my family, especially my sister. I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in LOCNAME. I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes. I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I never thought I would feel pressured to think. I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. I still have ten more minutes to write. I wonder how these will be graded. I have so much to do today. I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for. I hope the test won't be too difficult. I always worry about the first tests in a class. They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. I wish that all teachers would do a review. Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again. I guess its really repetition that makes me learn. Man, I still have five more minutes to write. I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there. In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. I think that I'm going to like this class. It seems like it will be interesting and fun. I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 0. 0 students walking down the street. My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least. 
__label__label1 Here I sit in the Jester computer lab, wishing that I didn't have to     be here. Why don't I have a computer, better yet, why don't I have a     friend that will let me use their computers? College is not like what I     thought it would be. It definitely is as hard as I thought it might be,     school work wise, but I thought that the friends part would come     easily. I have spent 00 years of my life living overseas with     americans. It was a military base in LOCNAME. The people in LOCNAME     schools systems are incomparable to the people in LOCNAME. They     are open-minded and excepting. I was raised to believe that all     man-kind was this way. I figured than when I got to college I would     miss my old friends, but be glad to meet some more great people in     this world. But here I sit, in this lab, alone. It's not like what I     expected, and worse than I ever thought. I walk around alone, and     although there are worse things,  I use to be known for being loud     and fun. I was the person that everybody knew, and everybody liked. I was somebody on my tiny base, and in my little high school of a     hundred people. But here, I am another face in the crowd. Of     course I didn't expect college to be just like LOCNAME (where my base     was), but I didn't expect to have no friends at all. People haven't even     given me a chance here. I'm just hoping that things get better. They     say that everybody has the same fears that I do, but then I see a ton     of people hanging out with friends. Not everybody is in my boat, all     of my friends are either across the LOCNAME LOCNAME, or at least in     another state. I don't want to be a pessimist, and I definitely don't     want to dwell on the bad, but it gets difficult when everything that I do     everyday is a reminder that I am alone. And here I sit in the     computer room typing this thing, not because there isn't a computer     in my room, but because it is my room mate's, and she won't let me     use it. I let her use anything of mine, I don't even understand how     people can actually be so stingy and be okay with themselves. My     friends have always come before my possessions, and people's     feelings have always come first, and I always know when somebody     is feeling down, and I have always tried to help them. I am waiting     for that what goes around, comes around" saying to come into     action for me. Also, I had decided to be a teacher overseas for my     life anyways, have my children grow up like me. This has at least     cemented my life goals for me. My children are definitely growing up     in a military school overseas. The people there are very warm and     accepting, and living among cultures makes everyone open-minded. I don't like the way that the people act here, and most of them don't     even realize what they are missing in this world. They just turn up     their noses and avoid people who are different, and don't like any     kind of changes. I have been through two evacuations from my     base, and I was just fine. I think that I can probably handle a lot     more than other people, and had they been stuck in a situation like     mine, a new place with nobody that they know, they might be feeling     just like me. But I do know that I will get over this, and I will feel even     more blessed to see my friends and live back overseas; and I will be     positive that I am doing the right thing when I give the life to my     children that I had growing up. I think that it shaped my character in     a good way, and if anybody here were open-minded and accepting     enough to talk to me, maybe they would understand that as well. anyways, I'm back, still here in this lab on this same computer. I'm     still here in this school with no body that I know. People keep on     coming in and out. Do they maybe feel like I do? It is so weird to be     standing in a crowd of more than 000 people, and not knowing     anybody's name. But that is 000 people that I could get to know if     they gave me the chance. That thought use to make me happy, now     I hate the idea. I miss my old life. But I wonder, if I feel like this,     there has to be at least one other person that feels like me. One     other person who feels like they don't know anybody. That thought     doesn't make me happy, but optimistic that maybe I will be able to     meet people sometime. In the mean time, I am thankful for all of the     true friendships that I made during my time spent else where, and I     am glad that I at least have a loving family and friends to pick up the     phone and call, no matter how far they may reside from me, I know     that they care. I no that no matter how alone I am on campus, I am     not alone in the world, and every night I go to sleep thinking of my     friends, and smiling. And I know that in my four or five years here, I     will at least make one friend. Maybe even tomorrow, so I'm just going     to stop stressing about today, and pick up the phone and call a loved     one for now. 
__label__label0 Well, first I'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever been given. I'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom I'm very in love with, but I really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. My roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. Which is what I am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that I have to do!  I think that if I can just do that then I will be able to keep with all ORGNAME my work and get grades in my classes that I will approve. I also need to get into the college of communications so therefore I HAVE to keep my grades up. I really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, I'm very excited about that. Also, God willing I really do think it would be awesome to go to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME for their graduate program in speech pathology. They have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if I'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus!  Ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and I'm sure whoever reads this is going think that I am a weirdo, but I really don't have much else to talk about. Hmmm. I am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family!  I think we will have a lot of fun and I'm excited that I get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. I'm having loss of words at the moment. And someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on!  Ok I did. lets get back on track here. I'M curious as to who gets to read these because I bet that would be a lot of fun. I'm sure that there are LOTS of different things said on each persons assignment. Gosh only 0 minutes of typing! Is this ever going to end!  (hey I'm being honesty here!)  I bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than I am, but I really am typing my thoughts and feelings. Actually I'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making NO sense at all. I think that sitting here and typing out what I'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what I would really be thinking about, because I'm trying to find something to think about that I can type about. Wow that was a confusing sentence. I'm surprised at how much fun I'm having here. I honestly thought that I would become homesick and miss everything back home and I also thought I would miss ryan a lot more than I am. I mean I do miss him, yes!  But there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things. Not complaining because I'm glad I'm not sitting around moping about him, I need to enjoy life, especially college life!  I really can't wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls. The girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you, but I'm sure if I was a guy I probably would not mind. Sitting here wondering what I'm going to type next. I'm not supposed to be planning anything out, which I'm not, but sometimes I just don't think about anything. I don't always have to have something on my mind do I?  Much less a feeling". feelings are sometimes so over-rated. Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 00 minutes. Well I just re-read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought, so I had to type it. Ok 0 more minutes to go, I'm almost there!  Gee I didn't realize how often I just don't think about stuff, but I usually do think a lot about different things, I guess just not now. I consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker, and have more mature thoughts than other people that I know. Take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm "yeah theta!". very loud, annoying, and obnoxious. Yes these are the people I am living with, sweet girls but nothing like me. I don't get into all the sorority stuff. Times running out. whoo hoo!  Now I can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment. which is, I must say the easiest graded assignment I have ever done!  So I think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this. Good idea huh?  Now I can think about is how I want this to end. I have about a minute to go. So I will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and I hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and "feelings" for 00 minutes of my life. Sorry if I bored you, which I probably did. but its ok, I'm really not a boring person!  Well have a good day and goodbye!  
__label__label1 hmmm. at 00, my life thus far has been where I want it. The ORGNAME has given me the newfound sense of self one craves after a monotonous high school career. Football, basketball, summer activities, ORGNAME academic meets, clubs, and band, they say, will be the things you cherish for the rest of your life. Memories. They will be the best years of your life say those who never went to college. The next 0 will be your best years of your life. " say those who have. But will they be? The Crucible was more difficult than anything I could ever imagine attempting, but I made it. Lying in a pit covered in barbed wire and mud and feeling the wildest sense of dread, failure, hatred, anger for being awake for 0 days with only 0 ORGNAME's to last the entire ordeal. Feeling that the sun would never set. Being away from my family and everything that I loved for a quarter of a year with no means of contact besides staying up after lights out, sitting on a stone cold toilet in the head because it was the only source of light by which to write. Knowing that you're giving up the sleep, the rest, that will carry you through the next day. Hate towards the others in the platoon for their Goddamn stupidity, hard-headed, fight without listening to reason, their never-ending bitching and trying to hold an edge over everyone else. It's a real life world of shit. Brings to mind that show on ORGNAME called "Oz", haven't seen but advertisements for it. Prisoners talking about "the hard life" of prison. What do they have that I didn't have at LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Prison vs. Boot Camp. They have TV, books, newspapers, double ply toilet paper, free time, phone calls, a weight room, good food, the right to lay on the rack whenever they wish, the right to sit down, cigarettes, the ability to do whatever the hell they want. What did I have? Not a single one of those things. A month in the desert, worrying that one of LOCNAME LOCNAME's pit vipers or coral snakes would find its way into my sleeping bag as I slept on a rocky desert floor, or the guy next to you on the firing line would trip and put a 0. 00mm round into your back, or falling while hiking without light on a steep slope in the middle of a moonless night with 00 pounds of gear and splitting my grape on a rock. Days go by slow when you're having a bad day at the office or in the classroom. ORGNAME is suspended when you're so miserable that you would almost rather die than continue through the rest of training It was a different sort of feeling felt in life. Hadn't had if before. but I miss it. I'd never felt so alive. What we take for granted in life: friends, our favorite book, the faithful German Shepherd, a home cooked meal, a grassy lawn, a drive down a country road that reminds you of your childhood. those are given new meaning. The feeling of infinite pride, accomplishment, belonging, knowing that you live your life not for the boss, not for others, not for money, not for possession, and knowing that you cannot be defeated. I felt that during ORGNAME ORGNAME graduation. That is what I will remember and cherish in life. Throwing the "greatest party", making $000 grand a year vs $00, driving an ORGNAME ORGNAME. What does that crap mean if you don't truly own yourself? Like those who fawn over celebrities or drive expensive cars that their ego thrives on but their families at home cannot afford. They will never know the meaning of life. I know that I may never be the investment banker that all college kids know they will be, but I will have a rich life. I will not be the movie star that everyone knows they will be, but I know that I will be loved by those who matter to me. I look forward to the future. 
__label__label0 clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it. - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it. hmmmm its 00* degrees celcius right now. that does not even really matter, I prob. won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something. spike tv. what kinda dumb sh** is this. this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv" - 00 minutes is a long time to be typing. I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are. better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out. is that possible. yeah. school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point. I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico. I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was. where do all these "personal type surveys" going. is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools. if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid. hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions. I think that job would be pretty boring. I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy. that is prob. why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing. I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity. that would suck. it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was "mentally handicapped". I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else. its crazy to be alive and conscious. consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation. joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy. I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. I can't really think of what to say. I need a cigarette to calm me down. that is not even how you spell "cigarette" but spelling is not even that important. I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar. but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled. that kinda shit pisses me off. need a smoke. 
__label__label0 My first week at ORGNAME has been okay despite the humid weather, long walks to class, and lack of sleep. Already I am behind on most of my reading assignments. My math homework which is due Sunday is incredibly hard. Other than that, I have met new people and taken part in new experiences. For example I have never shared any of my stuff with anyone. But when I came to ORGNAME, I must share everything, including a dorm room, ethernet cable, printer, etc. with my friends, roommate, strangers, etc. Life here is so different. There are so many types of people and the population of economics and psychology are overwhelming to me. The size of those classes is just a little smaller than my graduating class in high school. Another problem is that I must force myself to wake up in the mornings and walk to class. Right now my roommate is asleep which I am busily doing my homework and yet I am still behind. I can even hear her snore. Sometimes this is very distracting to me; however, you must learn to cope with these dilemmas. I have never understood why I chose to come LOCNAME. I have realized that getting into the business program is not that important because I am not the only one that got in. I guess I came here because my friends did. They influenced me that going to UT was cheaper than if I went out of state to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I took their advice, although sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision. Last night, some of my friends tried to convince me to attend a frat party. I knew she was never like this in LOCNAME. I knew she was curious about what it was like, but everyone should know what to expect at one of these parties. I am glad I didn't go. I am feeling overwhelmed, scattered, and tired right now. I hear noises of people doing laundry, the air conditioner, the stupid building fans that are spinning below my dorm, etc. The lighting in here is horrible because I don't want to turn on the light in case it would wake up my roommate. Although I am somewhat considerate of others like my roommate, are they considerate of me?  I always clean up my messes, but she hardly ever does. For example if my hair is left in the bathtub, I always wash them down the drain and when water splashes out from the sink I clean it up, but will she do the same for me. I guess not since her hair is always laying around in the sink and her items take up most of the tub and sink area. Well, I guess this is what it is like living with another person. I tend to complain a lot about things. Maybe I do this because I am stressed out or really mad at something. Sometimes on these assignments it is really hard to describe what you are feeling. When I was given this assignment in high school psychology, we had a certain word amount that had to be obtained. So I used ands and ums as additional words. Twenty minutes is actually a long time to write such an assignment. I am still thinking about what to write. There are so many things I need to finish. One for example is my calculus homework. So as my twenty minutes is about to end, I hope UT will bring me many great memories. 
__label__label1 I'm thinking that I should probably be doing some homework right now. But I am enjoying listening to the music that she is playing. That is one thing I miss about not driving anymore. I don't get to listen to music all the time. It is really weird not having a radio in my room, I even find myself just purposely stalling around the bathroom in my dorm longer than normal just so I can listen to the radio that is in there. I am starting to realize how random my thoughts are. As many times I have joked around about it but I really think that I have ADD. Now I am thinking that I really need to call this girl back. She called while I was eating dinner with a friend over at Kinsolving. I think that I am purposely stalling before calling her back. She asked for my number at this club, but everytime I think about I can't get over the fact that I kind of met someone at a club and the fact that stereotypes are funny. She is this kind of manly lesbian who is in the army and everytime I think about I just think it is really funny. Now I am thinking about my roommate and that she listens to good music. She is playing Third Eye Blind", which is my favorite band. Now I'm trying I'm remembering that this is the 0rd track on their 0nd album, "Blue". Now I'm trying to restrain myself from singing the song for the reason that I don't want to distract my roomie from studying or scare her with my terrible singing. Now I'm thinking that I really need to break/stop this clock thing of mine from beeping 0 minutes past every hour. I used to just ignore it but now it is really starting to bother me. I should find the instruction manual that or throw it away, I don't have patience for those kind of things, which is actually kind of terrible considering that I am currently an engineering major. Now I can't help ignoring the knot in my stomach, I'm nervous about something but I can't really narrow it down. I think it is a combination of calling this girl and the mostly ever present stress and pressure I feel from the whole classes/college thing. I'm really glad that prof. pennebaker taking about that in class today (that it is normal for college freshman to feel this way) I thought I might just have been being really weird and stressing out, which isn't too normal during this time of year. There is something about switching from the summer mode to school mode that always seems to stress me out. Now I just seem to be spacing out and not really thinking about anything. I'm trying to figure out if I am really tired or if it is just the stress that is making me feel this way. But at least it is a pleasant break the "dissecting my life" thoughts that I have been having lately. For the last two days I have been trying to figure out whether my lack of a party life was caused by me being a mature high schooler or my me just being naive. I'm starting to realize that I think I need to cut ties with my dad again. the drama just isn't worth it. I think he . sorry I'm distracted. my roomie is playing the "Turning Japanese Song". now I just had a vision of my mom dancing and singing this song. ohh, more 00's music  PROPNAME PROPNAME's "Beat it". wow, he is such a freak now. anyway. where was I?  oh 
__label__label1 Well I'm a bit nervous about this. Not that I really have any reason to be nervous, but college in general has been all new to me and a bit scary and overwhelming. I'm really tired right now, but I can't go to sleep because I have so much to do. My body is getting so run down. I really ought to take care of myself, I know. Well, I did go to yoga today. Besides, if I go to bed early, my roomie will stay up and make noise, something that makes me unable to sleep. Unfortunately, only I have early morning classes. Not her. But I love PROPNAME. Best friend, ya know. Oh well. I wish I could have more time to study though. Then I would have more time to sleep. Then I would enjoy life a bit more, I think. I liked hearing in Psych today that everyone is stressed first semester of freshman year. I truly did think I was the only one. Well yippee! I'm not alone! Although, I don't think EVERYONE is juggling 00 hours, with work, organizations, and a lot of time-consuming friends! But I guess a lot of people have their own time problems. Like if they are in a frat or sorority or something. Those apparently take a lot of time. That's totally not my kind of thing though, so I'm glad that I'm not doing it. Also, being in sports takes a lot of time I'm sure. Band too. PROPNAME is in band. He says it's a lot of fun, but I think it wouldn't be my thing either. Unless they sang in band. In which case, I would really enjoy it. Or dance. Dance is awesome. I really miss it. But you know, when I went clubbing this weekend, I really hated it. I hated how guys treated me like a piece of meat and basically violated my personal space and being. I felt like crap. I really hated it. And the thing is, I really wanted to hit the library that night, but nooooo, they said I would enjoy the club because it was salsa dancing - one of my favorites. Wouldn't you know it - they had like one salsa song. Man, that was upsetting. It turned out to be a horrible night. I mean, horrible. PROPNAME is going to bed now. That's a first. She ALWAYS goes to bed after me. Seriously, that's a first. I hope I don't wake her by typing. Actually my comp is kind of quiet now that I think about it. Besides, she claims she is not disturbed by little sounds. So good. I don't think it'll be too much of a problem. My head hurts. And this light shining on my keyboard is actually making my fingers hot. That's kind of creepy. I don't think lights are supposed to do that. Oh well. I really have to use the bathroom now. Hah. I bet that's a psychological thing. I only feel that way just because I know I can't leave the computer because I've got 00 more minutes left. How does this thing work? How can this computer tell me what my psyche is like? I mean, its a computer! How is it able to read what I have written, and then analyze it and give me a response? Hehe, maybe the TAs have to stay at the computer 00-0 so they can write in the responses. Hehe. Sorry, Mr. TA. I know that's not funny. Oh my god it's late. I'm talking to the non-existent TA, I'm so tired. Well if it weren't for all that studying I tried to finish, it wouldn't be so late! But of course, even after spending almost every free moment I had today, reading, I still am not even anywhere NEAR catching up in reading! It's all because of that stupid, stupid sociology class I dropped! I'm seriously upset about that! I mean, that class was by far the hardest class in terms of reading assignments. If only I had add/dropped the class sooner, I wouldn't have wasted all of my precious time on that one class. And then I end up switching sociology classes. Man. I make myself so mad sometimes. Well, hey. I am a freshman and new to all of this stuff. I guess it'll just take me awhile to figure all these things out. LOCNAME is so huge. I don't know if I will ever get used to the size. Actually, I'm not sure it's fully hit me yet anyway. But how on earth did I end up here? I was headed for famous, private colleges in the northeast, that were small, which was my main want in a college. Yet I've ended up at the biggest! PROPNAME is calling on my cell. Poor guy. He is had such a rough night. But hey bub. I'm doing my homework right now. I hope he doesn't think that I'm ignoring him. Well I am, I guess. But I do plan on calling him back. Although that would mean sacrificing more sleep, but oh well. He needs someone right now. I think that's also a problem I have. I spend to much time with my friends. Too many friends sometimes. Sometimes it seems like there aren't enough. Strange how that is. Well I know online (AIM) I definitely have enough friends to talk to. That's so hard. AIM always sucks me in because I get to talk to people who live far away and that I never get to see. I waste so much valuable time on that! Ugh. I procrastinate too much. Well, no, that's not true. I spend A LOT of time doing important things. And I guess AIM and hanging out with friends are my way of relaxing and taking a break. Although they really aren't breaks. Because they require so much emotion, and attention, and energy! So then I need even more sleep! BLOCNAME THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I CAN'T EVER GET! Same with in high school! Ugh. I was such an overachiever. All that for nothing though. ORGNAME didn't even look at all the extra work I did. Replacing lunch for a class. Not having any free time because of all the organizations and officer positions. So much going on. And all UT looked at was the fact that I was in the top 0%. Whoopee. Now I'm in. I think that makes UT a lot less prestigious. For that very reason, UT was my backup school. Because it was so easy for me to get into. Ooh, time is almost over. Last thoughts, LOCNAME? No. I keep thinking about sleep. Hehe. I can't get it off my mind. Maybe that's a sign. But I need to call PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME is moving. Did I wake her up? Oh, I can continue? Nah. I think this is enough. Besides, I need sleep! 
__label__label0 I am sitting here on the hardest chair known to man. Even with a seat cushion its still not comfortable. My roommate is talking to her boyfriend on the phone. They talk forever. They never discuss anything interesting either. Speaking of boyfriends, I miss my boyfriend. I am going to be really busy this week and I am worried that I won't be spending enough time with him. I have an application to fill out for a girls' group called the ORGNAME ORGNAME. It sounds fun but I am worried that maybe its not quite me. "  The girls are really obsessed with each other and I never get along that well with girls. Girls usually hate me. I think because they're jealous and also because I am pretty intimidating. PROPNAME PROPNAME probably hates me the most. I wish she would get over herself. God she is a bitch. It makes me insecure when PROPNAME's ex-girlfriends are always still calling him, IMing him, and text messaging him. I trust him but its hard not to be bothered by it. I hope we stay together for a long time. I love him a lot. Geez its freezing cold in here. I think I get abnormally cold. I can't handle temperatures that are less than 00 degrees. PROPNAME and Chance are talking about getting married. but not to each other. I wonder if they will marry each other? I bet they will. what a boring couple they are. I think I'm too harsh on PROPNAME. I always judge her but then again she judges other people all the time. She is very racist. She hates our asian suitemate because she smells. But it is true. she always stinks up the bathroom. This is the easiest assignment I have ever done but it does kinda suck because its time consuming. I am tired and tired of school. I wonder if I should stay in business. I don't think its totally "me. "  But then again I don't even know what is "me. "  I only know what I'm good at. I don't really know what I even like. I think I think too much about the future. I always over-analyze things too. I can't help it. I'm a perfectionist. at least I want to be perfect. It seems the harder I try the less perfect I become. Does that even make sense? My back hurts. I'm trying to sit up straight so I have good posture and so I don't have to feel my fat rolls on my stomach touching. I wish I was skinnier. but I can't say I'm totally unhappy with my size. I wish my hips weren't as wide and my tummy was a little flatter. Yeah. dropping 0 pounds would be really nice. My face is starting to break out again. If there's anything that has been a huge pain in my life its my skin. It affects so much of my life and attitude. I thought the birth control was helping. maybe its just stress. Yes, I am very stressed. I have not had time to breathe since school started. And I know its only going to get busier. Sometimes I wish I could just escape. freeze time and come back without it costing me anything. My fingers hurt. And I'm still cold. I'm slumped over now, I give up on the posture and fat rolls. I feel guilty that my family misses me so much and I don't miss them. I really don't. Not even my sister PROPNAME. which is a surprise. I thought I would at least miss her. but I don't. I should call them tomorrow. Maybe my mom could help me with my lonestars application. I have so much stuff to do. I'm scared. Why am I so touchy feely emotional lately? I used to never think of myself as emotional, but I think ever since I started dating matt I have become much more emotion oriented. I think I have become more insecure too. That does not really make sense though. But its like now I have to please him too. One more person to impress. before it was just myself and kinda my parents. but mostly my competition. I'm very competitive. I think of everyone as my competition. I bet that is unhealthy. but then again. what is healthy? I can't think of a single person I know that is "healthy" or has "healthy relationships. " I am almost done now. I'm just waiting for the clock to wind down so I cna start on yet another homework assignment. oh joy! I wonder why matt has not called me back. I need him to lift my spirits and to talk to. He is really wonderful. is that normal that I'm so obsessed with him? 
__label__label1 wow I just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit I'm so glad I'm listening to this cd it reminds me of PROPNAME, who I miss terribly at the moment. I wonder why he didn't call me back last night well I guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. I think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's Chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though I have on socks and my slippers I guess it's just that I always get really cold in hardin house I don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. I like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so LOCNAME has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and I think that's going to be a lot of fun, except I don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. I get really claustrophobic, especially when I feel like I can't breathe, kind of like when I go to sleep and I like to pull the covers up over me but I always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, I think it'll be fun but I'm not sure if I'm going to get in the whole way. I've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, I kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but I still really want to go in just for a minute to say I've done it. but PROPNAME was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and I don't know I'm worried because mark is a LOCNAME which makes me kind of not want to go over there I wonder why he's been telling his friends about me I really don't like that because I really don't like him and I know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that "hmmmmmm. interesting. " like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything I say, like I sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. I don't know I just really don't like that at all. and I think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. I think it's really funny that I've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but I just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. I still get them mixed up because I know I used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now I don't know which way is right because I can never remember if I ever actually fixed it or not. I think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. I don't know what I think about will. he's also a LOCNAME, so if I go to foam I get to see him but I also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. I got sick of the hyphens. anyways, I think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like I'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, I'm sick of this song and I'm changing it this one is happier but back to will I just don't know what I think of him. or that. whatever. I am leaving cause I love you, I am leaving cause I don't and I'm hoping you will follow and I'm praying that you won't let me go. I want to know who sings this song, PROPNAME never told me. I still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, I really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. I miss bo. I could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like PROPNAME, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing I'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. I don't know. scratch my neck. anyways I never really knew about that but I've always liked him, 0ven after he insulted the cake at my 00th birthday party, I can't believe he didn't remember that at all and I thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. I love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and PROPNAME both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and I liked PROPNAME and they were fighting over me. I wonder if it was right that I brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun I can't believe I actually stayed there until 0 in the morning and I'm glad PROPNAME never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though I know bo really wanted him to, I'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because I would have felt bad but I didn't want him to do that around me I hate smoking so much I hope PROPNAME quits it'll kill him I think it's so funny that PROPNAME figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the LOCNAME island party, I'm glad I wasn't there because I think I would have been really embarrassed. I guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but I like not drinking, and I like feeling like I don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow I only have like 0 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but I sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song I really do love this cd I wonder if PROPNAME is ever going to get me that nello cd, I really would love that. or maybe if PROPNAME could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it I loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? I don't remember. ha-ha PROPNAME used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but PROPNAME's married now. I don't like how I just sounded like a bimbo there I really am smart I promise. I feel really stupid in my world lit class though because I've never taken Latin and I haven't studied Greek, and I don't know I just feel like I'm behind the ball here on PROPNAME's inferno. I like the book a lot but I'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression I don't want raffa to think I'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though I guess I just have to learn when to speak up, it's like I'm wow that just interrupted me and I had no idea where I was going. . I guess I just get writing and I have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. I guess that's what I have to do when I start writing a paper because instinctively I start editing myself before I even begin and then I just end up never really getting anywhere. well I'm done here. goodbye. 
__label__label1 there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well I guess it'll give them more to think about. There is this song on rt now I think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot. I love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest British accent. I've been to LOCNAME well I mean LOCNAME. Either way I want to have a friend who is British like a guy friend I guess because I don't think id want to date a British guy, they all have gross teeth, I don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something. Oh I don't think I've ever seen a British person with braces either I guess it has to be something to do with the dentist. I just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called Clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, I have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending. I'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person I am talking to will be like wait I  thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then I'm like well yeah them too. Well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, I don't think I have a fav that everyone else like and I don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way I absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and I bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you. I've lost my train of thought, what I was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense. My roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, I don't know if I could deal using one of those for everything, I couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever. I think I should get my blood sugar measured, because I think since I have been at college all I do now is eat, and not healthy foods, I have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure. I was just thinking about how I looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, I'm not as comfortable being in one as I used to be. Oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team? and I was like no but I think I want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh aren't tryouts this weekend? and I was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you're really really good, I was happy to hear her say that, just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend, I got back to my dorm room and I was so happy, that can also be because I talked to PROPNAME rt after my class, we are really doing well I think after this weekend, things have steadily been getting back on track with us, I really think I am in love with him, I think the whole break up only made us stronger, that happened the first time we sort of broke up, I wish we could just spend all of our time with each other, I really do miss him a lot, and the thing is if we hadn't broken up this summer I wanted to break up with him before we started college because I wanted to date other people, but the truth is I've only been comparing other guys to him, I guess that's what happens, I mean I have seen cute guys but I haven't really met any yet, so I don't know if that's a good ting or not, anyway PROPNAME wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because I can't really trust him and neither can my parents, so that really sucks because I really do still want to be with him but my mom is like LOCNAME your a fool and blah blah and sometimes I feel like I kind of am because I start to doubt myself so much about the decision I'm making about us, its like would I follow my heart or mind? it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that's really how I feel, I think things are looking up and I think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind's  
__label__label0 I'm thinking I don't know what I'm thinking. its like my mind is still working although I don't know what to write. I wonder how the keyboard  came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are. my history class will be more difficult than I anticipated, my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about. I wonder if he's married, I think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife. I knew a guy at my high school like that, he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him, I never understood it. he was friends with the craziest people. PROPNAME had a death wish. he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge. I wonder why the timer isn't working. I thought a timer was counting down when PROPNAME did this site as an example in class. I'll just stop the timer when 00 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working. I hate computers. I hate computing. computing is going to be a bad class that I am not looking forward too. LOCNAME is a beautiful campus. I like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking. I want to get a bike so I can ride to psychology quickly on Mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after. I'm worried about kaitlin. I think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but I think war might change her in some way. she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers. I hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going. Iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. if a sandspider attacked me I would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life. rishi is making a weird ass noise. like breathing when you are lifting weights or something. brian is my best friend and he almost died. it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die. I am 00 and invincible or so I thought. this must change the entire way he views life. don't treat it as something to take for granted. it is definitely a gift and some people just don't understand that. they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse. I need to get a rug our room is dirty. I'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long. I like the way the window faces north. I can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning. I want to buy a hang glider really really bad. what is my fascination with flight, it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot I don't know. I hope I didn't choose the wrong career path with the one I have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless I become moderately rich. I hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel, even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever. I wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport. that might be a fun job. maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. Austin is a cool city. I think if my job permits me, I would like to stay here for a good portion of my life. I also want to live outside the LOCNAME for a while. in a country that has ancient cultural significance. maybe LOCNAME or LOCNAME or LOCNAME. that would be the shit. I feel like stretching. my back always needs to be stretched after I wake up. I wonder why that is. ok so the timer should have reached 00 minutes by now so I will hit submit. 
__label__label0 Ok. I'm here in the ORGNAME building during mandatory study time. I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.   Well. Anyway, let's see what's on my mind. The ORGNAME are really bad. I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and PROPNAME PROPNAME will be fired. He really is an Awful manager. Personally, I liked PROPNAME PROPNAME. Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager. Hmmm. well. my friend PROPNAME PROPNAME, who used to work for the mets, sat down with PROPNAME PROPNAME the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for PROPNAME PROPNAME. They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse. For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather. There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing. Is that a little bit disconcerting. Yes. Oh well. I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time. 0 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track. I just turned my cell phone off. PROPNAME has handwriting that's hard to understand. My battery life remains surprisingly high. Wireless internet is pretty awesome. Wow. This is the first time I've used wireless internet. I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 0 or 0 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 0:00. I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 00 pm. I should have brought those quarters. I knew I should have. But then I would have been late. I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness. Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today. She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today. That's sick. My dads had that car since before I left for school. That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 00 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste. Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet. I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going. I thought Id miss it a little bit. And I kind of do. I miss the actual acting aspect of it. But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all. It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit. It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside. Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories. My finger. No my thumb really itches. I'm thinking I should wash my hands. They feel pretty grimy. I did wash them after I ate that sushi though. The sushi was surprisingly good. On the other hand it should be good if its $0. The smell in the room. Well there is no distinguishable smell. Back in jester though. WOW. That place smells incredibly bad. It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with PROPNAME is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low. I think my 00 mins is up. 
__label__label0 Well today I went with my friend PROPNAME to his ORGNAME ORGNAME orientation. He tried to get me to join, but I just don't think that Crew would be the sport for me. I prefer to play volleyball above all other sports. Just this past week, I signed up for the volleyball teams here at LOCNAME. I would really enjoy to play for the school, or at least on a team, competing with others. I used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in LOCNAME, I guess that's why I like it so much. I miss being around my family, but I know that they are proud of me for being here at ORGNAME. I wanted to go back this weekend, since it's a 0 day weekend, unfortunately, I am a little behind in my classes, so I wanted to take advantage of this time to  catch up and maybe get ahead a little. The reason which I am behind in my classes, which is so unlike me, is probably because I am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time. I believe that this is happening because of the long summer. Well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me, which for some reason I have been avoiding. I guess because I don't want anything to do with him, I don't even consider him a good friend. Just now, my friend whom which I met through Hang Out, a gay organization here on campus, instant-messaged me asking me to go out. He has been taking me out, to places I wouldn't even think of going, since I arrived here at LOCNAME. Now him I do consider him a good friend. He is a really good guy, really fun to be around with. I don't know if I am starting to develop feelings for him, which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school. I spent last night at his house, just hanging out, talking about whatever came to our minds, and fell asleep on his bed. Nothing happened, but for some reason, I sort of wanted something to. I believe that I wanted something to happen because I have been feeling very lonely these past few days, maybe because of I need a boyfriend, or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give, or not going home for the weekend. Or maybe I just genuinely like him. Well I guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in LOCNAME 0 days ago, and my mom is going to mail it to me, and if all goes as planned, I will be able to keep the money for myself, if financial aid allows me to. So I will use that money to pay off my bank bill. And today, my mom called, and I felt like I was there even though we are 0 hours away, which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend. Right now, I don't want a boyfriend for various reasons. One, I have decided to put off sex until I get tested for HIV. I don't have suspicions that I may have it, but I have had unprotected sex, and so I just want to be sure. Second, I need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me. Third, I just don't know if I can handle going through what I went through with my ex all over again. Not that it would necessarily happen again, but I just don't want to take the risk. Or maybe I should just be brave and take a risk. I need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision. 
__label__label0 I am worried about my brother, PROPNAME, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, PROPNAME. We sang a lot, which I love. I'm not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in LOCNAME. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because PROPNAME and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won't let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I'm done with this. PROPNAME and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, LOCNAME, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around LOCNAME alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called "How Could I". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 00 pages long. I didn't get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won't get much sleep tonight either. PROPNAME has music playing in the background right now, but I don't know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven't done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I've moved to LOCNAME, I've really missed dance because I don't have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the "hook 'them" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I'm really tired, but I won't be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the LOCNAME in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in LOCNAME. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. LOCNAME is beautiful. The LOCNAME area especially. I'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  
__label__label0 I'm feeling a little stressed right now. I have two tests coming up in about a week and I'm kind of behind on my reading. There is so much stuff to take care of now that I am out on my own. It makes me miss my family; I'm feeling kind of homesick right now. When I woke up this morning I found myself crying. I'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me. It just happens to be my friend's brother so I'm worried about what I should do. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it and I just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me. But, I did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, I'm glad I had someone to talk to.     I'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but I'm not sure because I think I need to stay and study. But, I think I'm going to go anyway because I need a break and I need to feel more involved. Hopefully some people will go. I wonder what I should wear. I want to go shopping, I'm getting tired of always wearing the same things. It kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room. There are still boxes everywhere and I feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but I just don't feel like it. I keep hearing door open in the hall, I wonder if my room mate is back. It's kind of awkward with her here. I don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative. I still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night. Oh well.      I'm watching this movie on TV about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing. I mean I know I'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often. It makes me feel out of shape, I hope that I don't gain a lot of weight because I'm not working out as much. It felt so good to be back in class the other day. I love the Modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free. I guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and I'm one of the most experienced in the class. That kind of makes me relax because I don't get as nervous as I do around all the good dancers in the other classes. I get so nervous at auditions. I don't know how in the world I'm going to get into those major's dance classes. Then what am I going to do?        My RA just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie. I feel kind of stupid going because I've already been and my friends aren't going. But, oh well, I guess that I will just go. I feel like I need to meet more people. The only people I've have hung out with while I have been here are LOCNAME people. I thought I was going to get away from all that, but I don't know. I don't know what to write anymore. I'm thinking to hard about this and I know I shouldn't be. I should just type whatever it is that I am thinking.      The time is almost up. It went by surprisingly fast and I kind of enjoyed doing it. It actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. It's weird how writing can do that; Professor PROPNAME did mention that in my class. I guess it really is true. I feel like I should have an ending to this. But, I guess not. I guess your thoughts never really end. It kind of makes me nervous when I can't think of what to write. What does that mean?  It's kind of like when I blank out talking to people which I seem to do a lot. I'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. I wonder what the point of it is. 
__label__label0 So today has been one of the worst days ever. I found out that I didn't do that great on my biology exam 0. and I aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 0. I have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and I am still not done with it. I am hungry too. I haven't had dinner tonight. Well not yet. so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now. This is crazy. I don't know what to write. Its hard to write for 00 minute. it has only been 0 minute. This is crazy. I wonder how long I will get to use this computer. Oh, I don't know if my class code is right or not, but I think that's what it is. So we will see. I hope This is the right one. Who knows. I have no idea what to write. I don't even know what I am suppose to write. I am really hungry. Why wouldn't this Prescreening Survey thing work? This is very frustrating. I feel like crying now. Oh gosh the thing worked and I want to get it over with but I can't stop writing. I wish I had started writing earlier. I think what I just wrote didn't make any sense. No I am pretty sure it didn't make any sense. I think it doesn't matter. I realized that u think faster then you type. well at least I do. May be because I type slow. But who knows. I think everyone thinks faster then they type. Anyways, so I want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but I can't. So I wonder what PROPNAME is doing this weekend. I  have to study this weekend , because I am really behind. I make a lot of typing error. I have to improve my typing. I want to go to JCL and eat. Then again I don't want to go by myself. I wonder if PROPNAME would come. She probably would. PROPNAME needs to come get her book. I kind of feel obligated, but I don't want to call. It's her book and she should care for it. She should call me. Besides no one ever calls me other than PROPNAME. PROPNAME is a very nice  girl and I want to be good friend with her, but she  is always too busy with her high school friends. They are nice too. Why is it only 00 minute. It needs to be 00 minute already. I wonder what PROPNAME wrote for her writing assignment. OK so this is not a great assignment. I mean its very simple. It's very easy, but it is kind of annoying. It's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself. I mean you are writing for the class. Who knows. this is getting old. Actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast. PROPNAME was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies. Now that's crazy. Well   now I am hungry again. This is not great. This is actually kind of annoying. I think I wrote this line twice. I am not sure. Like the way I am not sure about my class code. I know I am right but its kind of hard to agree with it. Ok so I don't make any sense again. See I am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy. I know he is not going to read this but what if he does? He is going to think I am idiot. Why am I like this? I don't get it. no I am really annoying. I can tell. but oh well. I am who I am. People should deal with it. See now I don't make sense again I don't even know why I thought about those stuff. and wrote it here. I can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating. Except that there is nothing to cheat about. You will be cheating yourself. yay. only two minutes left. No it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast. I need to stop chatting on the internet. I can't even write a sentence properly. Internet does no good to you. well at least not to me. Ok I guess this is it then. only 00 sec left. yay. I guess I will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one. this is crazy. but ik  
__label__label0 This is kind of weird. I never set aside just some time for me to type and write and think. It's crazy that my thoughts are not really coherent. tiffany is typing next to me--her music is  loud and kind of weird. I'm not a big fan of rap. wow look at how the font looks smaller after  you don't capitalize. tiff's talking to me and going into the bathroom. Stupid homework.

I realize that even  though I am writing my thoughts down as I type, some of my thoughts are not being recorded  in this stream of consciousness writing because my mind is going crazy and I can think about a  billion things at once but I can't type it all fast enough. stupid fingers! type faster! type faster!  this is such a crazy assignment. I love how unstructured college is. I love how you can do  whatever you want and no one gives a damn. it's pretty spiffy! some girls is getting her face  redone for plastic surgery.

I think I'm getting fat. out!! peace 
__label__label1 As I sat down to start typing, my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment. A lot of times, I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings. To be perfectly honest, I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like, all the good times, all the bad times, the lessons I've learned and through which ways I learned them. I must say I am definitely a thinker, and someone who dwells on the past. Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time. I really miss my ex-boyfriend, who was also at one time my best friend. It's like I am missing a huge piece in my life. I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time, thinking what if, and if only I had done this differently. The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently, I guess the feelings just weren't there anymore and the basis of our at one time Ð great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us. Yay, my favorite television show is on, well one of them anyways, 0th Heaven!  From watching that show, I become relaxed and more open-minded. The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts, very useful in life and this day in time. I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much. However, watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but I know if I eat, I will get sick to my stomach. Eating is a major thing to me, partly because I am very self-conscious about my weight. Up until I got into high school, I never worried a whole lot about what I looked like or weighed, but freshman year hit me and I became paranoid. I saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting Caught doing what I had been doing. Of course my parents were disappointed, but they didn't get mad at me, they were just worried. I saw a psychiatrist, a counselor and a Dietician. The psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field, but my counselor, she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth. In fact, it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist; however, she does not know that. I would really like to one day become a child psychologist. I have always been interested in helping children. Hmm, I do believe the chicken nuggets I am fixing in the oven smell so good. I cannot wait for this weekend to come; I am going back home to see some friends and I think my friend PROPNAME and I are going to a football game Friday night, and then Saturday night, I get to race, which I am pretty excited about. We didn't get to race last weekend because it got rained out, which sucked, but I got to hang with my friend later that night, so it was okay. Wow, I just realized that I went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend/best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun I had from the previous weekend, and I just remembered about my hand. There is something wrong with it and I'm not sure what it is, but it hurts. I have a bump on it and every time I move my wrist downward, something pops over it to the left and when I bring my wrist back up, that thing pops back over to the right. It is really gross and hurts, but luckily, Friday, when I go back home I am going to the doctor to get it checked out. It's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you don't even realize it. Wow, its been over twenty minutes already and it doesn't seem like I have typed very much.  
__label__label1 I am watching mtv cribs with PROPNAME PROPNAME. Today was hot and I'm supposed to go running with PROPNAME but it's still too hot so I want to go later. Maybe I'll get some of my work done before then so I won't stay up so late like I have been lately. I'm really tired so I took a nap today and slept like a rock. I don't know when I'm going to supper though because I don't want to eat before I work out or I'll feel sick so I might just get PROPNAME to cook for me tonight. I am starting to miss everyone from back home because I'm not usually away from my family, friends, and PROPNAME for this long. I guess I will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. I want to go home to see everyone but I really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. I'm running out of things to think about because the TV is on and it's distracting me. The song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. I like all my classes so far but I'm still kind of scared. Especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. I'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but I can't get tired and go to sleep now because then I won't get anything done and I won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night I couldn't fall asleep forever and then when I finally fell asleep I kept waking up so I felt like I didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. I'm kind of hungry but lately I haven't felt that good so I don't feel like eating. Maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so I'll have someone to sit with. I hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then I sit with people I don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but I want to meet them and not be rude. I'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate PROPNAME are they only 0% not in one. oh well I have way too much school work and other stuff to do and I know if I would have rushed I wouldn't have time for anything else and I really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. My back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but I can't get into a back specialist for a while so I kind of just have to live with it. and I love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. I decided that I'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because I really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in LOCNAME at LOCNAME tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so I went and got him a present Saturday with my mom at the mall in LOCNAME LOCNAME. she wanted me to go back to LOCNAME with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but I wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but I really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake LOCNAME and it was really good like seafood/Mexican food. I've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while. 
__label__label0 I just read in PROPNAME PROPNAME's Understanding Human Nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood. And I consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. Now, I feel the only way I can attain happiness is to create something. To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. I need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. Now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, I turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which I can empathize and understand. My hunger for reading is insatiable. Everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, I want it all. I want to absorb it so that I don't miss an ounce of life. I want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after. And in all of this, with all the knowledge, as I absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, I feel great anxiety in that I have not made a contribution of my own. Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. My passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. Several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. I can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. The worlds I put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness. I am always looking forward to what I will be, what I could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions. And it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge. And I think back to my early life. My parents. Childhood. When everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that TV show that I've waited for all night. These were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. It makes me so tired to look forward. To never be now. My parents were demanding. Good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. Always left behind in someone's expectations. Enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. I loved them then. Cherished them. Everything I did was to attain their approval. Then I would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. An ovation of some sort. I need approval. I still do. My father was a loner, and now I am a hermit as well. He never shared his thoughts. Compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house. I made up games to express myself. My imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books I read. The stuff everyone else hated. The big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. When people were still learning their multiplication tables. Science fiction. Fantasy. Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. And I wanted to escape. Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. Still not good enough, because no one would share it. They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. I just wanted to be alone. With my books. My imagination. And I've never had a close friend, because I was always so afraid of betrayal. So afraid that I would be cast out, and many times I was, when I just wanted to think. Now I don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. I hope for someone who can share my mind. Someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.          
__label__label0 Well, I suppose I should think of a topic to write for 00 minutes. It is a mystery to what kind of issue or topic the professor wishes me to explore. I know he says to just type what I think, but the topic is so broad there are an infinite number of paths and possibilities to explore. What exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment. It can't be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 00 minutes. My mind currently draws a blank at what I should write about. Perhaps my first impressions of college as a freshman? Well so far, I think I'm still getting used to the fact that I am living on my own, and I do have a greater sense of independence from my parents. However, there are responsibilities I like and dislike having. Wow, it's only been around 0 minutes since I started. I really doubt I am capable of typing about no specific topic for a whole 00 minutes. Now I am thinking if I am required to type for the whole 00 minutes, or if I can simply hit the finish button when I have finished this stream of thought. Earlier, I started to complete a few experiment requirements. The prescreening requirement was not available, which is kind of depressing since it seemed like an easy 0. 0 hr worth of experimental credit. I hope it becomes available later. Now, my mind continues to draw a blank with nothing to write about. Honestly, I'm watching TV while typing this assignment, hoping to pass the time a little faster. It doesn't seem to be helping much though. It's strange when you try to force yourself to type about anything, nothing comes out. Not just nothing good, but ABSOLUTELY nothing! Well I'm nearing the 00 min mark, and I seem to have less and less to write. I wonder how long other people's assignments will be. Perhaps most will be longer than mine, but maybe not. Some soul must be just as stuck as I am. 
__label__label0 Well I am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering I hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. Too bad that I have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study I will be leading for kappa that I have little time to rest I really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because I have so much going on that I feel guilty if I am not always being productive. I know that I need to take time every day just to sit with God and tell him what is going on in my mind. So that's what I want to do with this exercise I am going to type everything I think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to God. I hate that I feel like I constantly need to be watching my money, or what I eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like I am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? I know I human, and that I am sinful and that I can't do anything on my own. So I don't know why I get disappointed in my failures, why should I expect anything else??? I feel pretty guilty about how much time I put into some of my relationships as well, like I wish I was there for Lauren F. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. Please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. I also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, I need you to make me aware of when I start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when I start to keep a constant tab on how much I spend or what people owe me. Lord I want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something I deserve because I know that I do not!   I also know that I need to take a nap this afternoon if I want to get any work done later so I pray that I would be able to do that as well. I have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. YOU and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. Lord I want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. I feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when I can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. I really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  I hate that I was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, I am also so worried about PROPNAME, MP, and PROPNAME, I just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you Lord, and understand your love for them. I wish I knew what to expect on this PHL test coming up on Thursday, but there I go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. I am worried that I am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as I should be but I know that I am doing the best I can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. I am so glad I got to spend time with ford this weekend and I really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in LOCNAME because I know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. But I know he was supposed to be here this weekend and I am so glad that he got to talk to PROPNAME last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. I feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason I am really upset that the tuna fish I bought and that 0up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $0???? come on PROPNAME you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly I am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but I know that I need to be really giving that to you and I really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. I am really hot so I had to go turn on the fan. I wonder when becca and PROPNAME are getting back, is it wrong that I kind of like that they aren't around right now? Why is it that I like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? I am kind of worried about PROPNAME maybe liking me, I really don't want him to, because I really love having him as a friend and I really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason I've been getting that vibe lately so I really hope that I can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. Man that 0up stuff I got is disgusting!!! why do I always try those things. Healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. I really hate that I am always feeling like I need to be repaid when I do something for someone I mean seriously! why can't I just give out of love and show like grace like PROPNAME did to us??? I am really excited about this PSYCH class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. I am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 00 hours of sleep I got on Saturday I really need to get rest because I know I don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! I just wish I would enjoy it I pray that I could have a peace so that I could sleep right now. 
__label__label1      last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 0 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 00 hours but I'm just taking 00, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank PROPNAME center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el PROPNAME. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 0 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that. 
__label__label0      Right now I am doing this psychology ut what will I be doing in the next couple seconds. Oop, my roommate just walked in and I have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time. Hard! My room mate said hi and I am having trouble responding to him, it looks like PROPNAME is impressed with my bass. All right you all have a good one. Roommate has left, that is weird. I wonder what Misung shin  yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and PROPNAME are going to do together, probably nothing much, I can hear my roommate, err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 0000 until the wee hours of the morning which doesn't really bother me but I think it might a little, who knows its probably just something to complain about. I want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with PROPNAME but I don't have his number so maybe ill call mom and  dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me, I got to do the psychology experiment before Saturday I don't really understand the experiment system but I think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well I have been going on for a while now and I still have a ways to go, phooey. I like my psych teacher though, he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting. oh man I think I accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well I'll just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good, and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology I was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if I could ever be  a professor who really really knew his stuff. Do I work hard enough? I think I do, I been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but I've been working too. Another thing that I can't escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind, yet maybe I think about it more than others. I think about whether or not I'm too picky. I haven't ever gone with a girl for longer than like 0 months I really can't stand the thought of a girlfriend, I haven't really met a girl that I'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks I've already had some opportunities but I just straight decided I didn't' want to go with them why? you know it has to do with looks I probably seem really shallow but I just want a chick who looks DAMN good not just good if I find myself thinking of reasons why I don't like you the fact of the matter is I'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late I've ditched some really cool people and I feel bad about it but then I've been ditched too sometimes I think I have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you don't want to be somebody's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so I need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date, don't worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that's what I say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things don't just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people I think I will ask PROPNAME and PROPNAME if they want to go out sometime now there's two people that look like they got their shit together PROPNAME dropped out of sfa last year so what? she has her priorities straight you know everybody has their faults I don't want to be recognized for getting a's in class that's crap I want people to say yeah that guys is a friggin funny cool guy I like being around him, but I only want people that I can get along with to say that how do you tell the ones that like you but you don't like them gto go away it seems harsh you don't want to be an ass and the fact of the matter is you may need them some day but for what??? as long as you've got your friends you are unstoppable you are having fun you are just with your buddies and you wouldn't have it any other way like my family man I just realized how much I love them by being away from them for such an extended period of time I really missed them I didn't think that would happen but it did my sister my dad my mom are really important to me and I love them to death bottom line man I'm hungry after this I'm going to see if I can get a hold of PROPNAME and singer and maybe well go get something to eat I got to talk to PROPNAME man that guy is really cool maybe I have the number in my desk somewhere I don't know but maybe ill just be lazy and go out by myself, maybe just maybe ill go out an meet somebody that will play an important role in my life maybe ill have one of the best times of my freshman year who knows what could happen in the 00 minutes after I finish this project who knows?  God knows? don't get me started I could write all the proofs that straight out blast Christianity to the nether regions but no I believe in that little piece of spirituality that's in us all call it God Jesus whatever its there but it is just there its our spirituality it is us so thanks for reading and ill talk to you later boi. 
__label__label1 stream of consciousness. Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's "A Light in August"  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. I. E: when I'm trying to take a  nap. Our refrigerator is in the closet. It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. My  roommate's name is PROPNAME and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell. He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family. I think he's from LOCNAME, but I could be mistaken. PROPNAME is dating a girl named  PROPNAME and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it. It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room. Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him. Oh I hate it. I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry. God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one. Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever. My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak. He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities. But he doesn't exactly say why. And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement. Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend. We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called PROPNAME's Ranch. So we found a new camp site called LOCNAME LOCNAME and it  was really nice. So we camped there with a fire and the whole 0 yards or whatever. But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the  ground. It was pretty bad, but I made it through. Only got about 0 and a half hours of  sleep though. ughh. Oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed  to PROPNAME's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. But we didn't give up hope and  went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got  to do one route because it started to rain. So after that our hopes were pretty much shot  so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and I took a nap  that I just woke up from about 00 minutes ago. So my weekend was pretty lackluster but  it'll be ok because I know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. Oh  well. My mom just called me a second ago and I was like, "can I call you right back? I'm  doing a project" and she's so understanding and just said "bye" really quick so after I'm  done with this thingy I'll call her back. I've actually been keeping in touch with my mom  pretty well since I moved here which has been nicer than I imagined it would. I expected it  to be annoying talking to her too much but I was mistaken. I've also been talking to my  sister via email which has been fun. She's so funny and always has something to say, but  whenever I call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and I just ask for  mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. I know it's weird, but the thing I miss the most about  home is my dog. I have a full-blooded springer spaniel named PROPNAME and she's such an  awesome dog. I miss her so much, but I'm hoping that if I live in a frat house next year I  can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. Oh well, I guess we'll see 
__label__label0 Right now I am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend. My roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls. My computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups. Speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it?  Is it with an ie of ei whatever I guess it really doesn't matter. I just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate. The delivery guy was chill, I like UPS. My roommate just put on a PROPNAME PROPNAME dvd so at least I'm listening to some pretty sweet music. I am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie. It looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good. I just looked to my right and noticed my bike which I have not ridden since I got to LOCNAME. Its a ORGNAME ORGNAME, which is a pretty sweet bike, I guess I should use it a little more. Me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in LOCNAME, that was tight. You would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond. My roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now. Its cool. I just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had. He goes to ORGNAME and has no friday classes. He then skipped monday because he didn't have his car. Today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having. He just asked me "Travis where are we eating tonight. "  That kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. I love college. PROPNAME is now playing Granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. I love this song. PROPNAME and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . GGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO. LOCNAME is turning out to be pretty sweet. I love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. My last school had 0000 students so I Knew just about everyone I saw, its a little different here, but its all good. Just looked at the timer and it looks like I got about 0 minutes left. Is anyone elses computer typing on like a 0 second delay?  Anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. Phsycology is very interesting I really liked the lie detector test. Props to PROPNAME for tricking that thing the second time around. Just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought?  One minute left that's really all I'm thinking about right now. The class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. Talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. Bye. 
__label__label1     Sleep! That's what I need to do. I stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on Bond- Born an electric quartet. I asked my roommate that I was going to get some shut eye for about 00 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 00 minutes later. I wasn't late. Thank GOD! I'm really stressed out, I have so many things to do this weekend. Why is college so easy yet so hard to manage. Management, I believe, is the biggest thing in college. I miss my family so much. I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and I'm pressing the wrong keys. Grrr! My roommate is leaving today to see her family. Good for her. We were both crying, actually I was the only one come to think ORGNAME it. She said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever. How can you not cry. I guess I'm very emotional and sensitive. I was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried. I hope they are healthy and son't worry so much. I want to see them and my brothers so bad. I'm done with classes and I'm free!! I love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness. It is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music. I really want to be super good on my electric violin. After writing my paper about the electric quartet, I realized that I wanted to be like them. I actually miss my quartet. They all went to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and are sophomores there. I'm always the youngest in everything. youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at LOCNAME. I feel so old yet so young compared to others here. I can't believe that there are 00 maybe even 00 year olds in my calculus class. I was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture. They are older than my professor and ORGNAME's. What are they doing here at such a old age, I wonder. Did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! I was walking out of ORGNAME after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money. I ignored him because I was creeped out. It is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he/she should. However, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, I would definetly give them some change. I feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them. Last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that I later found was gay. I really don't mind gay guys although I find it sad, I DO MIND if they are lesbians!! YUCK! I'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things. I am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence. I really want to keep writing on and on but I have 0 minutes left. I love to write especially poems. I like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings. I guess it is because I play classical music and only listen to classical music. Classical music, I think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created. I would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs. I better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go. I'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more. Whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing. Well, I got to head off to my Biology study group. Toodles! 
__label__label0 I REALLY ENJOY THIS CLASS. I CAN GET INTO IT AND NOT BE BORED LIKE MY OTHER CLASSES. THE CLASS THAT I HATE THE MOST IS MY CHEMISTRY CLASS BECALOCNAMEE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TEACHER AND I SONT UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT. MY MAJOR IS NURSING AND PRE-MED. I REALLY HOPE I CAN GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL SO I CAN BECOME A SURGEON. MY ROOM JUST LEFT TO HER LAB CLASS. HER NAME IS KATRINA BUT I CALL HER KAT. SHE'S SO AWESOME!! WE BOUGHT A FISH TOGETHER ON MONDAY. HIS NAME IS SENIOR SOL. OKAY!?! THIS THING JUST WENT BACK SO I CLICKED FORWARD ON THE WEB BROWSER AND MY INFORMATION WAS STILL HERE, BUT MY TIME STARTED OVER SO THAT SUCKS!!! I'M KIND OF WATCHING TV AND DOING THIS ASSIGNMENT AT THE SAME TIME, BUT MOST OF MY FOUCUS IS GOING INTO THIS. I REALLY MISS MY FRIENDS!!! ESPECIALLY THE FAB FIVE!! EMILY, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, ARON, AND SOID!! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!! I TALKED TO EMILY YESTERDAY ONLINE AND SHE'S ROOMING WITH ORGNAME AT ORGNAME AND SHE TOLD ME THAT PROPNAME IS GOING GREEK AND IS STARTING TO ACT LIKE A BARBIE DOLL!! I WONDER IF AS SOON AS I GO HOME IF ME AND HER WILL STILL GET ALONG!!?? HMM. WONDERS. I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM AND I DON'T THINK I CAN REALLY GET UP AND GO OR IF I HAVE TO KEEP WRITING?? I REALLY HAVE TO GO SO I'M GOING TO GO AND I'LL BE BACK SOON!!!. . . . OKAY I'M BACK! I HOPE THAT DOESN'T EFFECT ANYTHING BUT I THINK IT MADE UP FOR THE TIME THAT GOT ERASED. I'M WATCHING WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONARE NOW AND I WISH I COULD BE ON THAT SHOW BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT AND BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO BE ON TV AND MAKE MONEY AS WELL. IT'S REALLY COLD IN MY DORM ROOM AND I'M STARTING TO GET SICK. I REALLY MISS MY BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW. HE'S AT WORK THOUGH. HE GOES TO ACC AND HE'S A SECOND YEAR. I THINK IF HE WASN'T HERE IN AUSTIN WITH ME I WOULD GO CRAZY BECAUSE I WOULD BE HERE ALL ALONE WITHOUT FRIENDS OR FAMILY. HIS NAME IS REY AND ON THE 00TH. ITS GOING TO BE OUR 0 MONTH ANNIVERSARY. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIPS. MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE 0 MONTHS AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS OFF AND ON. THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH MY RELATIONSHIP WITH REY AND THAT IS THAT MY FAMILY STILL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM AND I THINK I SHOULD TELL THEM SOON. I REALLY LOVE HIM A LOT!! HE TREATS ME RIGHT AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT THAT WE DON'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. I TALK TO HIM EVERYDAY AND WE TRY TO SEE EACH OTHER EVERYDAY AND SO FAR SINCE I'VE MOVED HERE I DO SEE HIM EVERYDAY EVEN IF ITS JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I THINK THAT HE MIGHT BE THE ONE. HE TOLD HIS FAMILY ALL ABOUT ME!! AND SO FAR THEY APPROVE. ONE OF HIS COUSINS THOUGH SAID THAT SHE IS GOING TO THROW WATER BALLOONS AT ME BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. I ALSO MISS MY FAMILY A LOT BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THAT I MISS THEM BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE LIKE I TOLD U SO AND I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MISS US. MY MOM EMAILS ME AND CALLS ME EVERYDAY. EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT NECESSARY SINCE I HAVEN'T LIVED AT HOME SINCE JUNE SINCE I WAS ATTENDING SMU BUT SHE JUST STARTED CALLING EVERYDAY AS SOON AS I MOVED TO AUSTIN. MY LITTLE COUSIN PROPNAME THAT I MISS THE MOST AND I CRY EACH TIME JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM IS UPSET AND CRYS FOR ME BECAUSE HE DIDNT WANT ME TO MOVE AND HE NEVER SEEMS TO WANT TO TALK TO ME BECAUSE HE WANTS ME TO GIVE HIM A BETTER REASON THAN SCHOOL FOR ME MOVING. BIG BROTHER 0 JUST STARTED AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM, BUT A LOT OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THE GAME DISSAPOINT ME BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF BACK-STABBING GOING ON. I REALLY NEED TO READ FOR ME CLASS AND I NEED TO STOP PROCRASTINATING. I NEED TO GET ON THE BALL AND START STUDYING OTHER THAN DOING NOTHING AND WATCHING TV AND GOING OUT. I REALLY LIKE UT AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE.       
__label__label0 I'm tired, I just cleaned our apartment and now I'm tired. But I feel satisfied that I cleaned the whole place. My roommate is extremely messy and is hard to live with at times but I've known her for 00 years and I love her to death. Now my mind is being tracked to when we met at the baseball field when pur older brothers were at practice. PROPNAME, my brother is now is LOCNAME and I miss him a lot I think it hits me in waves. I wonder what it's like there, hot and rainy I suppose but I wonder if he misses us as much as we miss him. I think he probably does he just doesn't hank about it as much as we do. My boyfriend lives in College Station and I miss him too. It feels silly at times though to have this person you love and car about so much to have them so far form you let you still can keep close. Technology is incredible. I'm able to talk to PROPNAME once a month. He's in LOCNAME for goodness sake that's an ocean away. I talk to PROPNAME every day usually more then once. Now I'm getting hot, and I'm so thank ful the ac just flipped on. I find it hard to believe people were ever comfortable without the air conditioning. This summer at the camp I worked at we didn't have an ac in the cabin and I got used to it. I fact I would get cold when I was in the ac. But still the comfort of it is much better than without. I miss camp I miss my campers. It's the one place that I really feel at home way from home, I am so confident there. not that I'm not here I just have been there for ten years and have grown up there. All my best friends are there. Of course I have other good friends but there just f=something about living with someone for three months that gives you a new look at them . They learn your morning routine and you there's it  comfort thing because someone else knows you so well that they know how you wake very morning. I miss those guys. And it's not like I can't call them or even hang out with some but I don't. Isn't that strange that I love these people so much yet I don't call and hang out either them. Yes they call me and sometimes I don' t call them back because I'm nervous. Why?  I don't understand my strange want to be with people but my stronger want to be alone and watch TV and just do nothing. I need to start working out again, I t has been so long since I have I think I would have more of a desire to get up and go if I had more of a pep "I just worked out" kind of look on life. I really love PROPNAME PROPNAME. He had inspired so man people to get in shape and be healthy and support the fight against cancer that you just have to respect that. I also respect him because he had the same cancer my daddy beat. That was an awful time in my life. Freshman year found out that my dad has cancer. He's fine now but wow that scared me he wouldn't be here for so many things that he has seen it's incredible. Medicine is absolutely incredible. It makes me appreciate everything he does a lot more. Funny how even when he was going through all that awful stuff I was pretty unaware. My parents kinds kept us in the dark. Not like I asked but we just didn't talk about it. I feel like I really don't know what happen to him during those months except that he got better and now he's doing great. I wonder if he still thinks about it everyday or if he's let that terrible memory flee from his mind. Wow he is one funny man, he can say anything and I'll laugh but I guess that's how it should be. He should be my hero. I wish every girl had a daddy like mine I think the world would be a make more relaxed kin of place. He always makes every tense situation funny and more laid back. My mom is the opposite and I wonder how hey have been together for 00 years when they are so opposite . But I know she loves him and I think he loves her. He does he just doesn't always shoe it in front of us but I'm sure he does to her. He'll do really sweet stuff like on Valentines Day. I think she just needs to relaxes a bit and realize that not every situation needs to blown out of proportion. Wow that was really neat. 
__label__label1      So I'm glad that this assignment is like this beacuse I love journaling and writing my thoughts down. I must have had the most unluck day ever today, and now my mom is mad at me! That sucks. Such is life!! Oh well. I hope that I do well in this class beacuse I really need to boost my gpa up this semester. I can't wait to get my papa john's pizza, I am so hungry. Man I can't wait for PROPNAME to get here tomorrow too. I miss him so much. he kind of pissed me off today though because when I was telling him about my crappy day he had to get off the phone with me. Well I giess I really shouldn't be that pissed off. I'm sure I have done it to him numerous times. that's why I like him, he put up with my BS. Wow its only been three minutes. I don't know if I can keep typing for 00. this is actually harder than I though. my mind is totally blank  right now. Well actually its not because if it was then I would be thinking anything, but I an think about how my mind is blank. so it's really not blank. Ok I think I'm making things a little complicated. oh my goodnes there is this weird noise coming from somewhere in my room. ughhhh these stupid dorms. . Mann I got to a lot of homework to do tonite. Well at least I'm getting one thing done. That's good. la la la. This is getting kind of old. I have about 00 minutes to go, whoops there is the phone I have to go get my pizza is ready. I hope I don't get counted off for this. Man I'm excited about this pizza. Mmmmm can't wait. Man I'm really excited to eat this pizza. Its going to be so good. Man the smell of it makes my mouth water. I'm going to keep writing a little more since I had to go get my pizza. I wonder if my mom called me back. I really don't want her to be mad at me because she gives me allownace on friday. Man that's bad for me to think that. but I was just kidding though. Man I love chicken pizza. Its so good. Man that was I pretty cool assignment. I think I'm going to like psych class!! 
__label__label0 Hello, I don't know why I feel that I have to greet you, but I do. and I don't know who "you" are, because I have never tried to communicate with myself. that is so strange to me because I should know me well, because I am me. So. a stream of conciousness, eh? lets begin with the first thing I  look at: the keyboard. it is black, and the lettering is in white, capital letters. I know each of these letters by sound, and sight. how did I learn these? with out them I wouldn't even be here doing this. now I am hearing things. people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away, researching away. now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here. I don't know who they are, like how to adress them, that is. but they are here to help. and for some reason that makes me feel at ease. at ease from  what? I don't know . I guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy. my existence in this world makes me feel like I need to be recognized, sensed, felt, heard, or loved. isn't that strange? why do I need to feel this way? I don't know. but that's how I feel. moving on- what is another sense? I've gone over what I am looking at, what I am hearing and what I am feeling. but feeling in an emotional sense, not physical. I could have said I am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard, but instead I chose to elaborate on my internal emotions, and that is not one of the five senses. isn't that strange? so that covers three out of five. what am I tasting right now? well, I don't know how to answer that. I don't know how to describe the taste of my mouth. and even if I was still eating, how could I explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana? the only thing I could say is that "my mouth tastes like hot dog, fries and banana. " but that isn't necessarily what it really does taste like right now. now it tastes like nothingness, I suppose. what does nothingness taste like? I could ramble off synonyms, such as void or empty space even. but that doesn't mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it. right? like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like. there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry. mmmm strawberries are delicious. that's all I would be able to say. and now I am actually CRAVING a strwberry! even me typing the word, and the big capital way that I spelled "craving" makes me want it even more. I am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that I can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before I leave to go get some strawberries. it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but I have discipline. and that is what makes me different from everyone else. I have discipline. I won't leave now because my grade is so important to me. and its paying off, you know why? because I only have 00 more seconds to go!!! I am very happy now at the hought that I don't have to type any         
__label__label0      I hate escalators. Don't know why. I've always just hated them. Or maybe I'm afraid of them too. My right foot feels really numb. And not Comfortably Numb like that PROPNAME PROPNAME song. Just numb. Pink Floyds OK, somewhere up there with Verve Pipe and Nirvana. There's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me. He's wearing a fedora that's covering his eyes. He looks cool. Fedoras are cool. I wonder why guys stopped wearing them. I mean they look cool, especially in those old film-noir movies like The Big Sleep. I have no freakin' idea what that movie was about. The plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was OK. Some girls next to me are chattering/giggling. I hate it when people giggle that way. Its annoying. I hope I don't giggle that way then I'd be annoyed with myself. I wonder what it would be like to be somebody else. I mean what if I was the guy resting back on that couch? Would I be the same person in someonelse's body? Or someone different. I wonder if a different body makes you be different. I wish I had my CD player with me. Life sucks without it. Then again, it'll suck either way so I guess the CD player doesn't make much of a difference. I'm humming the tune to Something Stupid. Cute song. Though what the hell was up with PROPNAME singing that with his daughter? Freak. But he's a cool freak. The weather here is always so damn sunny. I don't like sunny weather, it gives me a sun burn. I like it when the sky's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain. That's my kind of scenery. Always has been. Don't know why. I'm yawning now, even though I'm not all that tired. I wonder what the girl next to me is thinking. She looks like she's in really deep thought. Maybe she's thinking about lunch. No, lunch is over. Dinner. Yeah, maybe she's thinking about dinner. I can't wait until this week is over. What time is it? There's never a clock when I need one. Life's inconveniences. I'm looking at my wrist, at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it. Hope I'm not late to class. Then again I was early to class the other day because I had my watch on upside down. My nails are too big, I need to cut them before I get a hangnail or something. My foots still numb, I wish the bloody thing would wake up since I've got a class to get to. I miss my friends back home. Hell I even miss my paranoid, stark-raving-lunatic of a mother. How pathedic. . I need a new pinky ring, this ones all rusty and broken down but I'm too attached to it. Its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway. Hey fedora-guy just woke up. Yeah, he's stretching his legs now. I wonder if my leg will ever move now. I wonder why people can't fly. I mean who wants cars and airplanes/jets when you can fly? That would be cool. I wish I could fly. But I wouldn't want wings, those would be too annoying to take care of. I also wish I could play the piano. But I guess desire never equals talent. Reminds me of LOCNAME. PROPNAME was a great movie. Great story. Fedora-dude is gone now, some other guy has taken his seat. He's not wearing a hat, but its OK. This guy's got long eye-lashes and a pointy nose. Pretty cool. I wonder if someday I'll wake up and everything was just one big nightmare. That would be great. I could start over. But knowing my luck, I'd just make the same mistakes. 
__label__label1 man I should have waited and gone to the restroom before I walked into the library's computer lab. . Geez!!!!!!!!!. . I really need to go but I can't because I have already began to write. . Well now I know that I must hold it and wait for these 00 minutes to past. Which could feel like forever. Wow! looking around I see a lot of students working on something that must be important since they sit quietly stuck to the seat in front of their computer. . Finally. Today was the first day in which I ate with some friends from high school. . Whom right now seem to be my only friends  here at LOCNAME if I am lucky to see them around in between classes. I know I should try and make new friends because you know what they say, "you meet your best and closest friends in college. " I have made attempts to talk to new people on campus, whether I'm sitting on the bus with someone I have never met or waiting in the hallway with another student for my next class to begin. I mean I want to meet many new faces but then again I am worried that the people I approach don't want to be approached by a complete stranger. I don't know but I need to figure something out so I can enjoy every little bit of my college experience. hey? wasn't there suppose to be a timer at the top of the screen? oh no I didn't bother checking what time I started to type!well it doesn't seem like 00 minutes just yet so ill keep typing about something. Well, lately I have been having doubts about whether to change my major or not. I am currently    a mechanical engineer major but have been thinking about switching to computer science. I feel like I will have an easier time in computer science because I find it more interesting. GEEZ!!!!! my arm is staring to hurt from all this typing and my fingers are all worn out. I knew I should have taken that keyboarding class in middle school so I would learn to type properly and not with the same index fingers. lately my mind has been full of worries and things that I need to do before deadlines. this morning I went to the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME to turn in my Defensive driving certificate and they didn't accept it because I need to pay off the balance of my citation first. Now where am I going to get $000 right now? My books left me with an empty wallet and I have at least 0 weeks to come up with that money. I think I'm just going to have to sell some of my valued belongings and maybe even donate plasma again. Yup! I have donated blood before and have received money for it and I told myself it would be my first and last time to do it. but it doesn't seem like its going to be that way! so I think its been 00 minutes now because I only had 00 minutes of log on time and I was just informed that I have 00 minutes left so yeah. . 
__label__label1      Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate PROPNAME woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAORGNAMEIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME called LOCNAME. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 000 student high school!! These 000 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 0 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . "PROPNAME, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-)

__label__label1      I am excited about being a columnist, not because I like the daily texan particularly, although I do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since I can go on to write for the ORGNAME or the statesman once I am out of college and I can get internships at newspapers during the summer so It will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, I'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, I don't know if I can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, I don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but I obviously can't leave them behind and I think I want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean I actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but I still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but I can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all I can do is leave my options open so I can make good decisions later, so basically all I can do is write as well as I can and make good grades, I don't know exactly how to do either but I do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means I need to go to the UTLC finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well I can do on my own, I'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, I'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as I love going to UT home games, an away game means that I can eat while I'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, I can watch it with whoever I want and I don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, I would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, I don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so I don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, I'm a little worried about what I look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot I can do about that before the next game but I'll do what I can, I'm bored with classes already, I havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since I am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so I can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more I do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, I've never lived by myself before and I havent lived away from home for that long, I've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since I don't live in a dorm anymore, I miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so I guess the solution to that is to get things done while I'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, I need to get some groceries, I don't think I know how to shop yet, I still havent made a grocery list longer than 00 items and that's not enough when I go to the store once a week at most, I'm sure things will get easier once I get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but I'm anxious to get to the point where I am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management 
__label__label1      ORGNAME kickoff tonight. should be fun to watch. Going to get depressed watching them play. actually probably not, but I wish I could play ball ! I played highschool football, and actually did Div,. III equivalent in LOCNAME. that was fun. This assignment is too long should be 00 minutes, not 00. I read a book that was stram off consciensness (did I spell that right?). PROPNAME, by PROPNAME wolf. I was an ORGNAME book. it ought to be fun going back to norway this winter for xmas. can't wait to see my parents and sis. and dog. coach will send me a CD with all our game footage from last season. Go domers. He said I could play whenever I was in norway. awesome. I was a badass corner back. if I was 00lbs heavier (muscle) and faster I could play for ORGNAME. It would be a frikkin dream come true. that's one regret that I have in life. maybe one of my only ones: that I will forever just be a varsity highschool ball players. or maybe not its not that big a deal I guess. can't wait til I'm flyin in the LOCNAME air force! greatest country ever!! this assignmentt is getting old. nnobody's going to read all of them anyway green mesquite bbq. Mmm I don't really want to go, but I want the bbq plus I get to see rotc people but I actually don't really want to now I want to lay in bed and watch tv play ta. too lazy I get my guitar toorrow this keyboard is hard to type on this opps this assignment is terminated 
__label__label0   When I got online tonight I was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person. The person, aka MuffinCheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night. Last night! Last night I was with PROPNAME, my roomie, watching Shrek! I was totally freaking out. I was telling PROPNAME that I had a stalker! This "MuffinCheeseqn" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them. Talk about freaky! Well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me. What a friend! It ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'Lil punk! Anyhoo, that made my night though. I've been over at my friend PROPNAME's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow. I've been there since 0! I don't like the first program and I'm majoring in CS! What was I thinking! They should have a major in learning the ABCs! Oh man its only been 0 minutes. Man, I think PROPNAME needs to be quiet so I can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! So PROPNAME has some pretty cute guys in her classes! I've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! OO I just remembered that I need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause I really don't want to write a five page paper! I'm not very good at writing papers. Obviously! I'm not very good at calculus either. Although, today I actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! I probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though. Oh my gosh. I have a calculus midterm on FRIDAY! well next Friday. I have to do some major studying this weekend. This weekend my parents will be out of town. It will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year. My mom just got a new job! Yeah for my mom! She's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job. So we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills. Thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0. My mom looked for a job for almost 0 months before she just got hired last week. She doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job. That's why she wants me to get an education. She doesn't want me to. PROPNAME needs to shut up! She just walked into my room. OH MY GOSH she's singing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Song! lol She just read what I wrote. OH MY GOSH now she's playing her mello. She's in the longhorn band. She's a big band nerd. I was once a band nerd. I played the sax! Wow I have like two minutes left! Well right now I'm feeling. Hungry! Obviously my thoughts are everywhere! Good-bye! 
__label__label1 I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 0 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 0 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 0 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 0 years, PROPNAME, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to LOCNAME because he was supposed to follow me here and live in LOCNAME too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 0 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics. I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester. I worked 0 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working. My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money. I received some scholarship money from PROPNAME, UT from my home town. We have community scholarship that they give out every year. There was a scholarship made in LOCNAME name this year. I got that one. That made me feel good I guess. I like being here but it is just really weird. I hope I adjust to LOCNAME soon. I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 0 weeks ago. My best friend PROPNAME helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home, but I am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy 
__label__label0 I feel that I have so much to do in the next few days. College is so overrated. The few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time, or do whatever it is that you like doing, equal all the other times you are reading, reading, studying, or doing other school stuff. I had a French vanilla cappuccino at like 0:00 tonight and it gave me so much energy that I can't sit and focus on one thing. It seems that I have been procrastinating all night. Oooh all that I need is you (so the song I am listening to right now) but anyways. now I don't remember what I was thinking about a moment ago. It must be that caffeine I'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 00 hours. O no. I'm not really sure what I just did. I hit tab because that's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead. So instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 00 minutes I think it was more like 0 so now I'm thinking about how I need to get in contact with the TA or the professor and explain how I will probably have two submissions but I'm not really sure because I don't know how computers work. They are so complex. I don't really understand them. Like earlier I couldn't log into the prescreening experimental stuff. I have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because I don't really trust them. I'm very skeptical of them. I feel like if I start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it. Like just now, I'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise. The song I'm listening to is sung by a different group, but the same song I did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing. During a heavy practice time I had mono I remember. Kind of a cool time because I got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasn't fun but I did get to know my teachers well that year. I wonder how the other two girls that I did the trio with are doing. They are both a year older than me so they've been doing this whole college thing longer. Speaking of long I just looked at the time and I've only been doing this for like five minutes. Looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever I made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didn't. I actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend. She is a choreographer for a dance team I was interested in trying out for, but I decided not too because it brought back to many memories. I am thinking about trying out for Steel Dance this weekend but I don't know yet. O yaw that reminds me that I need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because I really don't want to wear pink tights and a black leotard. It makes me feel fat. Which reminds me I never ate dinner tonight and its like 000. I guess all the PROPNAME chips and salsa I ate will have to do. Thank goodness for PROPNAME. He makes some awesome chips. I wonder who PROPNAME is. Or even if PROPNAME is still alive. My roommate brought his chips back from LOCNAME LOCNAME. My Hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories. I think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so I definitely will remember that one. O look more remember things. I guess the hippo thing is working right now. The song I'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team. PROPNAME and LOCNAME. They were awesome dancers. I wonder where they are now. There is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks. Actually PROPNAME has a pair of my comfy pants that I loved that my friend PROPNAME had on tonight. PROPNAME is in LOCNAME so I don't think I will ever see them again. Speaking of comfy clothes I wonder why all I wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt. It must be that whole college thing. O no. Here goes again. That whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when I didn't even click on the program. This computer is so random. Maybe I just need to update the AIM program. but then again I don't know that much about computers so I'm not really sure how I'd go about doing that. With my luck I'd probably download some computer virus with it too. And viruses. That thing about getting sick when you are most stressed. I will probably be getting sick soon because I am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project. Which didn't go exactly how I hoped but its over so I don't want to think about it. If I say I am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick? That is something else we learned about. If you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it. O man I don't remember the name of it. I am really going to have to study for this test. I should probably start this weekend. Well there is one more thing to add to my to do list. I started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer. I need to add that I need to talk to a TA for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before I forget. My 00 minutes is up now its a good thing I ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing I will remember. Now I really like this song. Its from 00 going on 00 that movie. I have started watching more movies since I got to college I think that is what I will ask for for my birthday-movies. O yaw my time is up. I need to get ready for bed so maybe I will get a decent amount of sleep tonight. 
__label__label0 Well. Actually, I don not know what should I write down here. I think that this can be a very easy assignment, or this can be a very hard assignment. How stupid! Honestly, today, I asked about it to a TA because I could not totally understand what should I do? I knew that there is no topic, but no topic can mean the huge categories. Anyway, this assignment made me confused. But, interestingly, a LOCNAMEn student asked about what she should do for the assignment in the today's class. At that time, I thought two. One is that there is also a person who do not understand the purpose of this assignment like me. And. the other is that "Oh, my god! Don't ask me. Don't ask me. Because I am an international student who came here in America a month ago. So. I am not good at listening to what people say yet, especially in the casual conversation. You know, young American university students talk so fast. Hum~~~ it is a big problem. So, I made her ask the same question three times, and finally, I could tell her what she should do for this assignment. How stupid!! Now. I am in a big dilemma. I have a difficulty keeping up with classes now, but I feel happy and can relax when I meet friends and drink with them. But, I have to study. So, I thought that now, I have to meet lots of friends to learn English instead of only studying in the library to keep up with classes. I thinks it is a great excuse to play. But, what is the priority for me?? Meeting friends to learn English and American culture? Or studying hard to keep up with all classes with no meeting others?? So difficult!! However, I suddenly wonder. Can I deal with both of them perfectly. . . . ?? So confused. Wow, time is almost over. but, I do not much. 00. 00. 00. . . 00. Ok! I have to finish this~~!!
