__label__label1 I don't like having to write an my couch. I need a better place to work. I don't want to go to work tonight. I sometimes feel like a trained animal jumping through a hoop. I really want a dog. Somebody that will always be there for me. I thought I had that in my boyfriend. I was always there for him Why is it that I always find the guys that I like or care about are unstable. Is it because I myself am unstable and I want someone else to make me feel better about my soft insanity. Or do I project such an image of  pure stability that they desire. I would like to be in a stable right now. Talking to a stable and then an unstable person, while grooming a horse. I want a horse to be able to ride him fast an hard through an open field to a tree that I could climb. The last time I climbed a tree I was trying to escape being pursued by a guy who had a girlfriend. I should have probably just told him no. Should I be more aggressive? I think that I am not because I can feel at times so much what other people are feeling. I don't them to be hurt by me because I myself have been hurt enough. I have always wished for an average American family A dog, a house with a fence, 0. 0 kids. I never got that though. I am beginning to realize that I am glad that I didn't. I like the person I am very much. I still need much more from myself though. I wonder why I surround myself with the things that I do. Why do I make my home a haven. Why I am afraid. Why do I have ORGNAME videos for kids or feel the need to buy myself flowers. I need more books I want more knowledge I don't want to be another close-minded individual in this cruel and cynical world. oxymoron. PROPNAME would like The Picture of Dorian Gray. I hope he will read it. Where am I right now  what do I need to be doing to get to my destination. I need to allow God back into my life. I need to stop shutting him out. I need to vacuum, and do laundry, paint, to do my chemistry, and talk to my soon to be ex-boyfriend. That is scary. I am going to alone again Why do I fear that so much. Maybe I am looking for the father I never had  I need someone to be there to praise me. I need to spend more time with more people. I put myself into seclusion to much But I like it My bicycles wheels are awfully big. they are huge,  I don't understand why guys always wish that they had a bigger penis even when they are large in the first place. Why do I have such a sexual mind. Have I Made myself that way for guys or am I naturally this way. Few things are natural anymore. I want to go camping and run through the Forrest naked like a nymph or a fairy. I want to appear magical to all those around me. 
__label__label0 000-00-0000 Sean crow male 0       I sure hope this thing works. I hate computers. I have been trying to  figure out how to use these things forever now and I am going to pray that it w works out well . Does stream of consciousness require correct punctuation I sure hope not. I am tired today because I stayed up tell four in the morning  and woke up at nine o'clock. the guy sitting next to me is weird because he  types so very loud. I sure hope this assignment works out all right. Psychology is very interesting to me. I used to want to be a psychologist  until I realized doctors probably get paid more. I am a not happy today. I  feel that the world is against me right now. That is stupid because I will  probably feel better when I finish my homework. I hate school. What is a  zip? my feet are soar. I got in a car wreck yesterday and I have a bump in my head that hurts me very much. My friend was afraid because he lost his wallet  that had a drivers license in it. It is cold in this room yet it is hot  outside. my Eyes are tired from the sun. My sister went to PROPNAME springs  today but I could not go due to the fact that  I am tired. I am the worst  typer. I due one finger at a time. I like to sleep. Tequila is disgusting  tasting. why do I feel so depressed at this moment. Probably because I had  too much fun last weekend. It is impossible to have fun during every  weekend. The rest of my weekends will probably be very bad and disappointing . I have not been in a theater in a while. I wonder what my old girlfriend  is doing now. Is she thinking of me. Probably not. I think that this is  not going to reach its destination. I am feeling extremely nervous right now. I think my twenty minutes is up. SOmethin is very unusual about the way this looks.       
__label__label0 Last night I had another fight with my mother. Maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. As far as I can see I have only brought her pain and no comfort. Although she does make several good points about my  unorthodox behavior, ultimately I am a grown man. If I told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time  the result would be ridiculous. Not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where I came from and what I have done. I've got a good job(insurance company $0. 00/hour), pay for my car, attend college,  help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. My mother thinks that my constant ventures  to places she has never been will bring about my demise. Certainly there is no way I can deny about her role in my life. She has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but I don’t see how she can try and write my schedule out for me  according to her opinions. Recently our dog had 0 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. Six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about  keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy I don’t even want. I tell her to give it away and then she  blames for being a cruel person in that we don’t know what kind of person would get it. For a while now I have been looking for a female. And I don’t mean just any ol' girl I can get plenty of those. But a lady who I won't get tired of after the first night in bed. There is  several ladies out there who I would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way I thought. So I just go on  with flirting' around. Most girls I know think that I except something from them, but I'm simply trying to be friends. I guess that’s  the rep I got at LOCNAME high. Maybe because of the people I hang with. Hopefully I've written enough, and if not here are some more  of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. In college I've tried to have different study habits then high school. In high school I could do  nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. Here I know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. I can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of LOCNAME or I might end up with a poor man working for ORGNAME’s or begging for money on the drag. A few days ago I read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind  to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. Interesting idea.              
__label__label1 I'm thinking about PROPNAME and the email he sent. E-mails. How could that be that he loves me. He doesn't even know me?  I should not have gotten so flustered the first time I read the letters. I should not have told anyone. Now he has become a sort of pariah in my mind, a weirdo, an outcast, never to be touched by me. An that was wrong. He was brave and poetic enough to bring tears to my eyes. I didn't tell that to anyone. I only went off on the fact that it "weirded me out" , thus I became the dumb blonde, the snob, simplifying this event into something that was "weird. "  Now, after I have read the letter again I realize how beautiful it is. Yes, he pairs me with his other love, marijuana, but even so. To him that is beautiful. He said I am what he needs. Angelic, a blazing conflagration in his heart. And none of my letters reached him. They were all sent back. So it is as if nothing has been said, even though my letters were written before I got to the love part of his. How can this be?  An ogre he is, always high on acid or pot. I have hardly talked to him. Before I left we stayed up until 0am, me, him and PROPNAME. Sitting on the grassy bank of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Being attacked by mosquitoes.  The sad thing is I know that in a week  I will dismiss  the situation, knowing his explosion of emotion must have been a result of drugs. But forgetting his poetic words, and how I may have brightened up his life. He wants to write movies together. That would be great if we could stay friends with the same old people always, me and PROPNAME and PROPNAME moving to LOCNAME after I gRADUATE, MAKING MOVIES. Yeah, like that would happen. And good old PROPNAME tagging alongside us, loving me. This morning the sun was low-- I am not used to mornings-- and it was cool. Perhaps I should start getting up earlier. The girl just sitting next to me was very flustered. I wish I could have helped but I didn't Have My if# with me. You know how in The Canterbury tales Chaucer capitalizes random Words just for the hell of it ?  Well that's how I type when I'm not thinking. I have a burn on my middle right finger and it hurts when I type. I talked to my brother and my ex-boyfriend on the phone Sunday night. I was good. I am so glad I talked to Woes. He wants us to say "I love you"  as friends when we talk. I couldn't get up the nerve this conversation but maybe next Tim I will. Its just so sappy and Embarrassing (note that capital E).  He is an awesome friend , though. It sucks so bad that he is a fundamentalist.  I had a dream last night about PROPNAME. The one that is soon to be gone to LOCNAME for a year. I think I'll write him letters. He called me the other day here at LOCNAME of all things. But I had to let him go bc PROPNAME was on the phone. Then I called back and he was gone, never to be heard from again. In my dr0eam we kissed. Like last summer and the summer before. In my dream he was in love with me all over again, in love with my smell. I was so happy and so was everyone else.  That sucks so bad that he's a devout Jew.    
__label__label0 Well, my name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME I am now thinking about what I am thinking. I am thinking about Physics. Physics is hard because I have never taken a class in it and the first one I am taking is a college course. Another thing I am thinking about is how long these lines are and how much of a page am I really writing. Did you guys set it up this way on purpose to see something or to tell something about us. Well, if you want to know something that I am feeling right now is that these lines really annoy me by being so long. That is o. k. cause I will just deal with it. I am also thinking about my home and what my girlfriend is doing. If she misses me and other things about her. I am missing her. Studying here is tough and so are the classes. But hopefully that will just make me learn more. There are two girls next to me and they are talking alot. Usually I get people next to me in the computer lab that talk in French and Spanish so I don't know what they are saying and it does not bug me as much. Finally the end of the abnormal typing line. Well, I can understand what these girls are talking about and I don't even really care but they are still distracting me from providing a researchable paper. It really does not annoy me that much but, I like perfect situations and that means everything goes my way. Unfortunately that does not always happen. Guess what they just left. It is really quiet and I can think lots better. Well, since I have been in college I have thought about the future more. Does everyone think about the future more in college. I bet the majority does. I am really worried about how everything is going to work out after college if there is an after college. I would like to become a big success and become a great doctor but so would a million other people and I know there is not room for a million other people which narrows the picking for medical school. I will just do my best and the hope the best comes of it. Nobody knows though what will happen. This is pretty neat turning in a paper on the computer. Finally another line. I am going to try to pick up another class because I need more hours. I hope I can get something that will help me maximize my time here. My counselors said that I can only take 00 hours which is nice advice but who has to go to school here them or me. I would like to get out of here as soon as possible. Not because I don't like it, but just cause I am eager to see what I will be in the future, a success or a complete failure. Well, 00 minutes is up and I have to confess that I have been correcting my grammatical mistakes just cause I feel better if I do. I hope you understand. Bye.         
__label__label0 The problem I have with this writing assignment is that there is so much going on in my life right now that all of these different worries and concerns keep popping into my head. The one thing that I am looking forward to is that today I am meeting my parents in LOCNAME LOCNAME for dinner. They are giving me my fraternity dues in the form of a check and my answering machine . My pledge brother PROPNAME is listening to ORGNAME right now so it is very hard to concentrate and rigit is pissing me off. My humanities course is causing me a lot of stress because the teacher did not pass out any kind of syllabus so I have no idea how I will be graded. It just occurred to me that this essay is sounding more like the second writing assignment than the first, but I guess it doesn't really matter if school is what's on my mind. The girl next door has been on my mind a lot. Lately I find myself wondering what she is doing even though we agreed to be just friends because she lives next door. And now that I think about it another girl is always on my mind too. However she lives upstairs and I'm pretty sure I could hook up with her if I wanted. I am very excited about my fraternity. I am looking forward to our bar tap on Friday and I have promised myself I wouldn't drink until then. I really need to establish a routine, because I think once I do that I will be a lot less stressed. I need to start working out again to so that I won't feel like a complete piece of crap for partying too much. Last night I went to PROPNAME PROPNAME to see the girl I am kind of dating but actually I don't feel any kind of affection for her. Which is something I should tell her because she apparently likes me alot. I think I am starting to get kind of sick . Probably has something to do with the fact I go to bed between 0 and 0 every night, but at least I scheduled afternoon classes. 
__label__label1 This is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 000,000,000,000 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from LOCNAME to LOCNAME. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's PROPNAME. He's so cute. anyway PROPNAME is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call PROPNAME, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little PROPNAME within 0 days of coming to the great state of LOCNAME. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 000,000,000,000 guys, and about 0 girls. Today I got to go with PROPNAME, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 0000.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 000 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought PROPNAME some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to LOCNAME. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that PROPNAME likes me. I think PROPNAME is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give PROPNAME up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where PROPNAME is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark LOCNAME across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow. Thank you, PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label1   I don't want to be in ROTC, but I have to strive for a scholarship. My parents can't afford to send me through all four years in college. I need money!!  I hat ROTC. it's so stupid. Left face. Right Face. Bullshit. I don't want to be in the military. But to save my parents money I guess I'm going to have to put up with it. Oh well. Man I can't believe I slept  I mean overslept through Nursing. I was there for only the last fifteen minutes of class. That makes two classes that I missed. Chemistry Lab and now this. I have to make straight A's I have to. I must succeed. My parents worked hard to see that I do. Damn it. I would be perfectly happy living in a small apartment working as a waitress well may be not a waitress. May be a teacher . Anything . I don't care how much money I make. But I owe it tom my parents. I'm not going to be like my brother. Damn I need to buy some shoe polish and some brasso for ROTC. PROPNAME I hate ROTC. I'm already taking fifteen hours plus four more hours or is it 0? of ROTC. That is too much for a freakin freshman. At least to me it is. Man twelve more minutes to go. I hate my roommate. She's such a bitch. She's a pig too. She ate all of my peaches. I said she could have one not twenty. I'm tired of techno music. I like rap and r&b. They don't play that shit down here. I wish PROPNAME would hurry up. I'm hungry. I'm so stressed. I need a break. Summer was too short. I miss PROPNAME. I miss sex. I need sex. That'll relieve my stress. But I can't do that. It's against my morals. Yeah right. Why don't I have sex?  There are so many guys around here that would be more than willing to have sex with me. I'm so damn attractive. I'm like a magnet. I think that's the only thing really going for me. My looks. But that sure ain't going to last. I need to start concentrating on getting my mind fit instead of my body all the time. I wish I was as smart as other people. I want to be a pediatrician. No actually I want to be a veterinarian. But oh well. May be some other lifetime. Hopefully she or he would be more prepared than I was. I love PROPNAME, but do I want to marry him. Will he be faithful to me. Does he really love me?  I love his son so much. PROPNAME. Perrion. I love Perrion. I wish I could see him. I love him more than his father. I would do anything for that little boy. Damn I hate the mother. I have never been jealous of anyone in my life, except for her. PROPNAME PROPNAME. I hate her. No I don't hate anyone. I'm such a nice person. I couldn't hurt a soul. That night I could've pounded her ass, but I didn't. I have self control and I have maturity. But damn it would have felt so good just to break her face. I miss PROPNAME. I can't believe she didn't want to spend any time with me when I came down to visit. That hurt so bad. I loved that girl. She was like a sister to me. What happened?  My loved ones are leaving me left and right. Soon daddy is going to pass away. No. I don't want you to daddy. I love you so much. Why can't god give some one else his pain and suffering. He doesn't deserve it god. Give it to fucking PROPNAME PROPNAME or that guy that killed that little girl in LOCNAME. But not my daddy. It's not fair. Okay 00 minutes passed. I'm done. 
__label__label1 Well, here  I am writing continuously for twenty minutes. The weird thing is that this keyboard is laid out differently than the one I have back home so it makes typing really difficult. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I got a cut on my finger and hitting the I button tends to hurt a little bit. I am a little concerned about coming to the end of this line but apparently it will automatically wrap my words for me. I am going on a trip to the beach tomorrow. Well at least that's the plan. We don't have anywhere to stay not to mention any food. Oh well, it hopefully will be a lot of fun. I am sitting at Mac 0. I wish they had ORGNAME's in here. That would make my life a little easier. The computer in my room crashed and I can do absolutely nothing on it right now. It's weird I have been writing for about five minutes and I am only on my third line. Well I guess that's what long lines will do to you. There were really long lines at the student computer center the other day. MY roommate was such an angel and stood in line for me when I went to class. A girl just walked in to the computer room with headphones on. I think that is a little weird. I guess she likes to listen to music and type at the same time. I guess you can do laser copies in here. I will have to remember that. I went out for coffee last night with my roommate and his girlfriend. It was a lot of fun and I got checked out by someone really cute. I wonder if this computer lady will help me figure out my e-mail in a little bit. Last time I asked she dismissed me very quickly. That shirt reminds me of ORGNAME's. The one a guy walked in here wearing. I really wonder what you are going to learn from me by reading this. Probably that I am very random, (all my friends tell me that) They also tell me I am a crack head. I'm not really, it's just an expression they use for me because I am so random and jump from subject to subject. Don't you think it's weird that we still write stop on stop signs. We could probably save a TON of paint if we didn't and besides who doesn't know that a red octagon means stop. That sounds like a really bad commercial. I have to go to class at 0:00. I feel weird telling people that I am going to Acting class. I feel very pretentious. I really think I am going to like the class though. I have been in theatre since fourth grade I just completely lost my train of thought. It got derailed you could say. I wonder what derailed it? Oh well, I guess that's what you are trying to figure out from me writing this. Life imitates art. I miss PROPNAME PROPNAME. Not really, but she is someone whom I am supposed to miss. I really miss PROPNAME. She is one of my best friends in the world. I called her the other night and when I heard her voice I could do nothing but cry. The computer lady walked by. Apparently she chooses whom she likes to help and who she doesn't. I never know when to use who and whom. I think I am going to save this really quick so that I won't accidentally lose it. Wait never mind that would lose my train of thought. I think it would at least. I really wish I could read some of the other students stream of consciousness papers. I want to see how similar they are to me. Maybe they aren't similar at all and I am the weirdo in the group. That's what my sister would like to have me believe. She pretends that she doesn't miss me but I know she does. I wonder how this whole e-mail thing is going to work. I can't wait to e-mail my dad and PROPNAME. I would e-mail my mom too but I don't know her school e-mail name. It's scary how many e-mail accounts my family has, I think the grand total is eight. Maybe nine. I don't know if my sister has one at school or not. It depends which class she is in. Nine accounts and four people. There are way to many ways to reach us. This is an odd power PC. This computer contains the fonts necessary for the software packages ORGNAME and PROPNAME. I  wonder what those are. Probably some English programs or something. At least that's what the name implies. El tiburon means shark in Spanish. I think there is an accent but I am not so sure. Fireworks are really cool. My mom and I love to go sit under them and feel the booms. A couple of years ago there was a grass fire near where we were sitting. It was kind of exciting. Not something like rescue 000 but still it was interesting for us. I hope you find this interesting and not just some drivel about me. Drivel is such a fun word. It reminds me of dribble. Well, I have to jet. I hope I didn't write for too long but It is fun getting your thoughts out on paper. Like I am doing now, Auggghhhh the insanity. Or sanity, however you want to see it I guess. 
__label__label1 Okay, so we're supposed to write for twenty minutes about nothing really. It's a show about nothing-Seinfeld. That is an episode for all you non-Seinfeld watchers out there. You really should watch it though. It is really funny. I like funny. Funny is good. I am trying to type fast without looking at the keys and it is not working. PROPNAME thinks she's so cool cause she typed faster than me in micro computer applications last year. I wasn’t a very fast typer. I am stupid because I forgot to look to see what time I started writing. I am going to assume that I've only been writing for about three to five minutes. At least I am getting this done though. I have to go to psychology class in forty five minutes. Last class we took these tedious surveys for eligibility  in experiments. It wasn’t fair because there were like 0-0 surveys for just girls. So all the guys got finished and left to go take naps or eat. Speaking of eating, we ordered Poky Sticks from LOCNAME's pizza last night. I hope the roommates pay me back for that. But I don’t want to be rude and ask for the money. I am really cheap. But it is all coming out of my spending money. My friends are all getting money from their parents. My dad is being annoying though. He wants me to learn to budget my own money. He would have given me so much a month if my older sister hadn’t told him that she didn’t get any money her first year in college. Those older siblings cant just be happy for the younger ones can they. Everything has to be fair, doesn’t it. Oh well. I shouldn’t be complaining I guess. I am getting to go to the school I wanted to go to. I am getting the feeling that people around me are trying to read what I am writing. I know they're not though. They have better things to do I'm sure. I’m just paranoid I guess. Today is Thursday. We have a floor meeting tonight. A chance to meet our neighbors. Warning !!! When you log out all your files will be erased!! That is what the sticker on this computer says. I think they are over-using  exclamation marks there. But that is just my opinion. I am not really one to use exclamation marks very freely. I think it is raining. I had to walk back from the library yesterday in the pouring rain with my roommate. She is pretty cool. She smokes too much though. I am trying to break her of that horrible habit. I think she is just getting annoyed with me though. She has bad posture. We've bonded already. I m glad I didn’t get some kinda weirdo for a roommate. She says she is getting a haircut today. Then again she has been saying that for the past two days. I really need to spit this gum out. I've been chewing it for almost two hours. Some random guy gave it to me when I was waiting to go to my boring English class. I need a computer in my room. My mom says she bought me a lava lamp for my room. I really want her to come down and drop it off, but I don’t want her to stay for the weekend. I am getting very sleepy. This staying up until 0am every night cant keep up for much longer. I have about five more minutes to write. What else should I write about. I feel like a lab rat. Are people going to read this later on and analyze me. Will they get in contact with me if they find out that I have some kind of mental illness? Or will they just forget about it and write a book about Me? My shoes are stiff from the rain yesterday. and I have to go to the bathroom really bad. Gotta spit this gum out. I am getting antsy. I think its been twenty minutes. This was fun. 
__label__label0 I am so down in the dumps right now because I have just broken off  a two year relationship. I seriously  hope I didn't just throw away the best relationship I ever had or will have. I can't help but feel slightly unattractive right now because PROPNAME has already started to get over me quite well and PROPNAME and PROPNAME don't treat me the way they used to. I don’t understand why people can't simply be honest about the way they feel. I probably have spent half of my life wondering what everyone else was thinking. I t is such a waste of time. If I saw a girl and she seemed really nice, I don't see why I couldn’t just go up to her and be like, "hi"  And  guys won't ever meet a girl with the intention of gaining a friend. The whole process is so much more exasperating than it seems worth at times. The friends I have now are my good friends. I just instantly clicked with them. There wasn't any of this trying not to seem overly eager to hang out with you bullshit that usually goes along with the turf of making new  friends. That's sort of why I resent LOCNAME I guess. The stupid system and expectations they have totally just messed me up in the head. I don't have nay self-confidence. It is hard to feel like you are somebody in a class of 0000. I wasn't good at any sports, or at least not good enough to play there. so why did I come to a school with 00000 people full of clicks just like it was in high school?  I will probably be perpetually putting on the front of self-confidence and self-assuredness. that’s what sucks about the world. Everybody just bullshits everyone else. People are so insincere and self-serving. I know I am. there are so many rules that govern the group that you belong to. You can't wear what you want or anything. I am not saying that I don't like the way that I look but every now and then it would be cool to go out in what I want to wear  or whatever and I could know that people weren't  talking about  it behind my back. Looking at my thoughts on screen makes me so ashamed of them. I'm nit a bad person. I just kive up to every part of the whole Greek system that ever gave it a bad name. rush is such a load of crap. everyone acts like they know or care who you are. it all turns out to be the same people in the same crowds that they ran around with in high school. I wish the rest of the work wasn't like this too. But I guess is doesn’t matter where you go because it will always be the same old bullshit. pretty girls date the cutest boys who have the good luck to bring home the big bucks to raise their kids in an upper middle class lifestyle. so it goes. Kurt vonnegut really knew what was up. That's why I like him because he doesn't preach all this "the sun will come up tomorrow crap"  he knows that if the sun comes up tomorrow you will probably get a really bad sunburn and die of skin cancer in the end. I hope mark doesn’t meet any girls at this party I just don't want it to be too late to have him back once I get this whole lifestyle change thing out of my system. 
__label__label0 I'm really unsure about this assignment because I'm afraid I won/t be able to think of things to say for 00 minutes so I'll start off with why I'm so mad right now. last night PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME and I went with PROPNAME and trey to go coon hunting because PROPNAME and I went with them last weekend and it was fun, so anyway we drove for an hour to get to PROPNAME over this bridge that they hang prostitutes from no that was later first we went to this house that was so trashy that PROPNAME didn't even want to go inside to use the bathroom so she went outside that’s gross then we drove to the place for hunting and  they made us get in the bed of the truck and trey drove about 00 mph and we were flying all around we played this I’ve never game I didn't realize that PROPNAME and PROPNAME are just like me that’s cool so then we go over this bridge that smells like shit or rotting carcasses or something and we were so scared because PROPNAME was telling a ghost story abo0ut a bridge and then trey turned around and we went over the bridge about 0 more times we were so scared then we get to the field and PROPNAME was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out PROPNAME had begun PROPNAME had PROPNAME and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and I refused to go any further and PROPNAME screamed at me that I was a bitch and he didn't give a fuck what I did so I went back through the woods with no flashlight so I could get in the truck I have never been more scarred in my entire life I prayed the whole time and I took spice out because I was afraid that I was going to get raped and murdered or something I was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that I loved them and that I would miss them because I was going to die then I heard a voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure I was okay I was so happy then about  00 minutes later the others came back, they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they'd stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time PROPNAME is bitching to PROPNAME about everything and treating her like shit I think she could do so much better but she's in love and I told her that but we didn’t get home until 0am and I had a 00 class that I've missed too much already but I made it and that has basically what has been consuming me today I’m sorry if its not what you wanted. 
__label__label1 Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at LOCNAME. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I haven’t met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these "fine" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real "fly" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 00 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or "hidden" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasn’t so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow . 
__label__label0 I'm so glad PROPNAME, my roommate, just left to see PROPNAME, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. I think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. I remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. I don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when I’m not using it. Someone is very loud in the hall. They sound like they are having fun. wish I could join them. Is PROPNAME thinking about me right now?  I wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. I wish I was a better typist. There is so much chemistry I need to be doing. Is there a party in the next room?  PROPNAME just walked in. is he up to something?  This room is kind of hot and I could really drink something cold right now. I just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language I don't know. French wouldn't be bad to learn, though. Wish I was at LOCNAME LOCNAME right now. I just saw PROPNAME and PROPNAME on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. Well mom and dad were fun, but PROPNAME was a royal pain in the butt. I even have Chip and PROPNAME wallpaper on my PC. gosh, am I a fanatic or what. I think I just know a good thing when I see one. Speaking of good things, I wish I was good at chemistry so I wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. I don't think I'm doing this assignment right because I'm now to the point where I'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. My hair is in my face and I wish it was alot longer than it is so I could pull it back. Jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. This comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and I always hit it when typing. Who keeps slamming those doors. Doesn't anyone have homework besides me. I put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. This coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, PROPNAME is so cute nose itches. it always does. Does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. If it's true I hope it's PROPNAME. I wonder where he is now. Is he going to call me soon. When I get through with this I need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. I miss PROPNAME. She's the only friend I can really tell things to. If she came up to UT I would never get any of my homework done. But then again she would spend alot of time with my brother. He treats her so bad. I don't know why she puts up with it. I always wondered why people couldn't answer when I asked them what they were thinking. This assignment proves there is always something on your mind. I just hit the home key and it took me to the beginning of this writing and I wasn't smart enough to figure out to hit the end key until I scrolled all the way through what I just wrote. If I could type faster this assignment would flow a lot more smoothly and I wouldn't lose any of my thoughts while typing previous ones. I wonder how long it's been. The way I'm sitting here is hurting my back. I can't believe I wrecked my car and got whiplash. It's been two months and I'm still doped up. I can't even carry a bookbag without it hurting. It sounds like there is a guy talking outside my window but that is not possible because I'm on the tenth floor. It's been almost twenty minutes but this is kind of fun. I should do this more often. It got my mind off of chem for a while and relieved some of my stress. I'm such a basket case anyway, I worry way too much about stuff that I end up doing just fine on. The phone is ringing in the other room. I wonder when PROPNAME is going to call me. If I didn't worry about him so much and worried about chem a little more I probably wouldn't hate it so much. I can't wait to go to the frat party this weekend. There are so many guys there that want to go out with me. I wonder if that's true or if PROPNAME just said that to flatter me or to make himself believe that he has a beautiful girlfriend. Oh I'm so bad, I've only known him for a little while and I'm already second guessing him. He is actually the best guy I've had in a while. He is so smart. how sexy. That guy is still talking outside of my window. I guess I shouldn't be correcting my mistakes when typing but even my friends say I'm a bit of a perfectionist. 
__label__label0 My thoughts, sensations, and emotions are always changing with each new experience, idea, and whatever happens throughout my life. They are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently. Right now I feel like I am in control of myself because I am doing well in school academically, socially, and mentally. School work is very important to me and I make sure that I do well. I don't go overboard like a lot of my friends who study hours every day. Socially, I have adapted very well in meeting new friends. Mentally, I am in control and focused on what is going on in my life. There were some problems that have caused some stress in my life since college started. First, me and my roommate got in some petty arguments, but now we are getting along just fine. Also, I had some guy problems. I regretted doing some things I knew I shouldn't have done, but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before. I know that I haven't been eating right and sleeping enough, which is causing some changes in my body that cause me to be more tired and weak. I always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for my classes. Last night a friend called at two in the morning and I talked to him for hours even though I should have y eight-o-clock class. I am in a very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me. I'm usually a nice pleasant person until I am faced with a lot of stress or go through PMS. Then I get in a really bad mood. My friends know when to stay away from me. The only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. the assignments they give us are no problem, but the reading is crazy. They bombard us with reading assignments that  really aren't necessary. My art class, for instance, requires for the present moment for me to read from pages 00 to 000-something. I really don't want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras. Anyway, I miss my family, but I'm not homesick at all. How can I be when my parents call ALL the time?  I know they care for me, but it's really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend, which I won't allow them to do. That sounds mean, but they're going to have to get used to it. I do miss the free laundry and the home-cooked meals and my own room and my nice bathroom, but oh well.                     
__label__label0 I am very excited to be taking this psychology class since I was unable to take a psych. class in highschool. I am hoping that this class will give me some  direction on my major. As of this moment I am supposed to be working towards pharmacy school, but I am beginning to think that it wouldn't keep my interest for very long.    (You know it is very hard for me to just write in my train of thought, and I don't know why. I'm not much of a perfectionist or anything)    Anyway back to psychology, Psychology really sparks my interest. In class, we discuss finding answers to many questions, but they normally pertain to other people than ourselves. Most of the questions that I would like to explore pertain to understanding myself. I am generally a happy person, and although I know that I will go through tremendous changes during my college career, I feel that I have a pretty good grip on the person I am. But--even though I feel this way, sometimes I have uncontrollable and unexplainable emotions. When this happens, all I can think is "why?"  Psychology is one of those things that I  don't know much about, but even with the little knowledge I have, I am amazed. I think it is very possible I may want to have a career in this area. I don't  really know how I got on this spill about your class; probably because it drives me crazy not knowing what I want to do. I've always had everything very planned out, but after really thinking about it, that isn't the way I want to plan the rest of my life (if that makes any sense). What I mean is. I can't just pick a job (say Pharmacist), and decide "I’m gonna be a pharmacist. "  That is what I  did about a year and a half ago. I even got a job as a pharmacy tech at ORGNAME’s which could help me out a lot. But, now I feel like pharmacy would get very dull  and boring. I feel like I'm on an endless search for something that really sparks my interest. I've never been really exceptional at one thing or in one subject, and that makes me feel kind of lost, like I don't have a calling. Psychology sparks my interest more than anything else, but I haven't been through the  course so I can't really say if I have a "passion" for it or anything.   Along with my search for a "passion," I want success more than anything. I have had an average life I guess, but my life would never be complete with out stress. Not stress in general, but financial stress. I know that I am much more fortunate than many others, so why am I so stressed. I guess because all of  my best friends were spoiled rotten, and I began to forget that I was so fortunate. I wasn't able to do all the things they were able to, I didn't get to drive a  nice car, go shopping , or out to ear. These are all things that I believe are superficial, but I would like to be able to do these things with no worries  when I am older. Even more so, I would like to spoil my kids rotten when that time comes around. Anyway (I’m a little scatterbrained today), I am a little afraid that when I find my so called passion that it will be something that will not allow me to accomplish my second goal. 
__label__label1 Well, it's becoming quite obvious to me now that the homework is beginning to pile on, but I'm perfectly okay with that because of all the stuff I went through last year in school. I did one of these for my psy class in high school and I remember some of the stuff I wrote about was quite funny, but hey, it's a stream of conscience. I actually love doing these kinds of things because for the majority of the time, the way we think is a stream, and it's never-ending. I really want to play tennis sometime soon, but today I just don't have the energy. I wonder when I'm going to get physically ill from staying up so late every night, and changing my habits a great deal. I'm getting quite used to the college way of life now. It's rather scary that I'm becoming more and more comfortable with calling my Jester dorm "home". I definitely miss my bed in my real home. I wonder what else I have to do tonight. I love having all the assignments, tests, papers, quizzes, etc. ahead of time so I can plan ahead and not be able to  blame my teacher if I forget something. This is really good for typing practice. I love my schedule, yeah tomorrow's a terrible day for classes, but aren't all Mondays terrible. I can't believe my hand is cramping up already. That has got to be a bad sign. Sometimes I really am not sure if I'd want people to know my stream of conscience. At times it can make people sound very stupid, like now. I'm very excited I received a call from PROPNAME tonight, he's such a great friend and I haven't seen him or talked to him since I left LOCNAME. That's a terrible word to spell, but hey, living there my whole life I should be able to do it in my sleep. Oh, sleep, that sounds like a great idea. I am way too tired to do anything, but that's when I need to force myself, and just get into a studying groove. I'm really not looking forward to the noisy people that will be hanging out below my window tonight, playing guitar, singing, talking loudly, until early hours of the morning. Then I'll have to call down to the Jester  desk again and complain. They must hate me by now. I wonder when I follow up for the psy experiments. My roommate has way too much stuff around her desk, but she lets me use her computer, so it's a fair trade. I love typing, although crazy as it may sound, I do. I am just itching all over. I want to go outside, but I really don't feel like leaving the comfort of my room and face the people of Jester. I am terribly blind with out my glasses or contacts. I really need to call in my contact prescription tomorrow, so I can actually see. I feel that I've been more tired lately because I haven't had my contacts, and I'm self conscious about my glasses, so it's quite a strain on my eyes, and as a result, I am more tired. I just lost complete track of my thoughts. Oh well, must start on a new track, I mean isn't that the purpose of the exercise. Speaking of exercise, I really want to get out and run a few laps, I know that it would help in being so tired. I'm tired of the Jester food, I've been living off of bagels, not from Jester. My roommate just came in and told me something that changed my thought pattern and now I'm concerned with the issue of how guys talk about girls, and how they treat girls. The whole issue is a problem of some sort in everyone's life, I just wish I didn't have to deal with it. I am quite addicted to diet cokes and diet drinks in all, I think I have a serious problem, yet I live for it. I feel like one right now. Boy do I need to do laundry. It just keeps piling up, of course the one day I finally decide to do it, everyone else has the same idea. I can't wait to go through the dorm experience, and then move on into an apartment and have things of my own. I wonder if I will have an apartment next year, and I wonder who would be my roomie(s) then, if any. 
__label__label1 This assignment was not as hard to figure out as I thought it was going to be. Actually it was quite easy. All I had to do was follow the simple directions. It is pretty cool in here. This library is not quiet though. I thought libraries are for people trying to read or study, but this one has lots of little rug rats talking and laughing. Oh well. Next weekend is going to be a lot of fun. I get to go see my boyfriend, who lives in LOCNAME. I can't wait. Boy, I miss him a lot. I wonder how much my phone bill is going to be from calling him almost everyday. These two guys sitting by me are talking about weird things. I don't think they can figure out their computer. What do I want to buy today, when I go shopping?  I'm not quite sure. Maybe I will get a new dress. I really need to start looking for a homecoming dress. I have to have it by October because that is when ORGNAME ORGNAME's homecoming is. Hopefully my parents will pay for it. How do I tell them though, that on the way to LOCNAME LOCNAME I got a speeding ticket. I guess I will just tell them that I was so anxious to see them that my anxiety caused me to speed. The police officer was not very understanding though, although I was at fault and I am going to pay the consequences. I need to study all day today, but I’m not really looking forward to it. If I get behind in my school work though, it will be extremely hard to catch back up, and I don't want to have to do that. Maybe I will go out tonight and have a really fun time dancing and stuff. That ought to compensate for me studying all day, and release the stress. At least I will have something to look forward to tonight. For now I only have studying to look forward to. Who do I want to go out with?  Maybe I will call up PROPNAME. She's pretty fun to hang out with, or maybe I will go to a club with my brother and his friends along with mine. No, I did that last night. It was fun though, maybe I should do that again tonight. Whatever the case, I need to have a night of fun planned so that tomorrow I can study all day again. I wonder what my roommates are doing. I bet they are watching TV  That's all they ever do. It must get boring for them, but evidently they like it. I can't do that, because I get overly-bored. They are the type of people that don't like to do anything outside of the house. I can't believe I got messed up with them. If I only knew that they were like that, I would have never agreed to live with them. They are kind of psycho. I don't know how anyone can fight and be unhappy as much as they are. I try to stay away from there, but maybe I need to find new places to go. My brother is probably half way to LOCNAME right now. I hope he is doing well. At least I got to see him before he left. That girl has a tattoo on her ankle in the shape of a snake. That is so ugly. I would never get a tattoo like that. I think it is so unattractive to guys. That lies right above the piercing on the face. I don't really think too bad of piercing your belly button, but anything else is too far. Actually, I have even thought about getting mine pierced, but I’m not quite sure if I want to go through all of that pain. Wow, that lady has a huge afro. Doesn't she know that it looks really bad. I guess if she thinks it looks good though, then that is all that matters.     
__label__label0 I’m finally getting to write this. I should have done this two weeks ago. well my girlfriend came by, she’s in high school still, and she's going to miss the rest of the day to be with me, but first she has to go to the doctor. I really love her alot. damn I hate it when people call me and want all this information, they really piss me off. Dalmatians aren’t good dogs once they get bigger. they are really mooding and alot are being brought to the animal shelter, I don’t work there or anything, I just heard it on the radio. I work at the library, but I’m not working today because I broke my finger playing softball with my brother, I got 0 hits, but its nothing like baseball, I’m going to walk on at LOCNAME but I don’t know if ill make it or not, but I’m going to give it my best try. me and my girlfriend have been going out for a month now, we met about 0 months ago and dated a bit then, but nothing serious ever happened, that’s probably because I was still hung up over my old girlfriend. but know its just me and her and we are in love. we’ve only had sex once and I think that’s good, because with my ex-girlfriend that’s all we ever did when we were with each other, and it became pure sexual. I don’t want that to happen with PROPNAME(my girlfriend now) I really really want to get serious with her, I think I found the girl I could spend the rest of my life with sounds strange, but I really think I have. anyway I wish shed hurry up and get back I miss her. I think the reason we haven’t had sex more often is we never have the opportunity, her parents or grandmother are always home and my parents are home too, but I think that will change. I hope we stay together forever, and I know she’s does because she feels stronger about our relationship than I do, so I know I wont have anything to worry about. six more minutes and I’m finished, oh well I think this is fun. the simpsons are stupid, I use to like it when I was younger, but now I think its just stupid, I’m going to kill myself, just kidding, my brother and his wife are both psychology majors, my brother went to swt for fours years and know is a police officer, and his wife went to LOCNAME for like 0, she was on the deans list and everything she’s super smart. well I’m getting on out of here, its was nice talking but I need to go to class,  
__label__label0 I just wasted over an hour and a half trying to get my stupid Ethernet card to work. the worst part is that I waited over four weeks for this stupid thing to come in and now none of the drivers and software recognize it. I think it is  royally <blank>. now I have to waste another two hours talking to technical  support so they can take the thing back. what a rip. this makes this day a  really big let down, considering I complained to my parents about getting this  thing up here for me. I could have been doing some of the hundreds of hours of  homework that I have to do. this day has been really wasted. every day is a  waste. all I do is homework each day and nothing more or less. occasionally I get to watch half an hour of television or go to the union or go play a few  video games, but lately, it seems that every class wants me to spend a few hours each night working on their assignments. I haven't even had time to look around the LOCNAME area. I haven't seen a movie in a while either. this place  really sucks. I don't do anything really interesting. I have no life. now I’m complaining too much AND being self-conscious. I couldn't even read my notes on that example. he talks too fast for people to keep up. psychology sounds pretty cool. the breeze never hits ORGNAME. it's like it is always hot and the sun never goes away. maybe one day it will turn into fall in this town and finally it's  be relatively cool so I don't marinate in my own juices. yeah, I know it sounds gross, but what would you call it? I take a shower, walk to PROPNAME, when I  get there, I’m tired and need to take a shower, and I sure do work up an appetite. it's the way back that is a killer. by the time you get back to PROPNAME hill, you feel like rolling over and dying because of your full stomach, the  supersaturated shirt and the fatigued feet. I need to jog more. it seems like  I’ll never have time. I never have time to do any of my old hobbies. for crying out loud, I can't even get y network card to install onto my notebook. I wish I had time to do my old hobbies, like photography. I could have and should have majored in photography. maybe I should major is psychology. it's a really  interesting class and I kind of like it I wish they served more than three flavors of ice-cream. it's like that chicken. 'today for dinner, roasted chicken. for lunch it'll be chicken dumplings, tomorrow it'll be chicken soup. then  creamy chicken blank. tomorrow it is chicken patties, the next day it is chicken nuggets, the next day they'll run out of chicken and serve chicken fried steak with chicken gravy for the steak and mashed potatoes' it's repulsive what they serve us. maybe I should reduce my meal plan. better check in the morning. I  still have another few minutes. my roommate is asking about cyanide. I guess  that’s what happens when your girlfriend dumps you. tough break. he's been really depressed. he's been like this all evening. I wonder what I’ll do tomorrow. I better get a plan together for what needs to be done. hmmm. I wish I could  get my net access. now I’m pissed. 
__label__label0 I am sitting in my suitemates room listening to them hang up a poster. I need to go and wash clothes, and I am also kind of hungry. I feel like I don’t get out of this dorm much but what am I going to do. I want to call my grandma and see how she is doing and my computer needs to be fixed. Right now I am getting bored in this room because its not mine. They really need a TV in here I couldn’t go without one. with no TV and video games I would get bored very easily. I feel like playing pool but I am not that good at it, and it just frustrates me. My brother is the one who can fix my computer so I need to give him a call. Haven’t seen him in a while. Haven’t seen my sister in an even longer time, need to talk to her too. she always studies and her cats are really cute. Every time I think of my sister, I think of her cats at the same time. Thinking of her cats reminds me of when they were at my house, with my dogs, one of which just died. I miss that dog. We’ve had him I guess since I was in second or third grade, He was eleven, so that would mean we’ve had him since I was seven,  thetas a long time, had a dream about him last night, him and my other dog PROPNAME, who died a year before him. It always makes me sad when I think about those dogs. Now the stereo is playing and it reminds me of how loud this thing can play,  just hearing bass in my room. Gotta stop  hitting the wall when that happens. I need to go out tonight, haven’t done that in a while, did my studying, now just need to find some place to go. I wonder how my dad is taking all his kids being off to school. Haven’t really talked to him about it and I don’t know how to bring something like that up. I really miss my 0 wheeler at home, I loved riding that thing,  I wonder if there is anywhere to ride up here. need to win the lottery so that I can get some more  0 wheelers. my last ride in LOCNAME LOCNAME was the day before I left, with a friend of mine, who now for some reason I feel a lot closer to. its weird. Cant wait until Thanksgiving so that I can ride. Now all I can think about is that my twenty minutes are almost up and I wonder what I am going to do after I’m done here. Probably just kill time until I go and eat dinner. Hope they have something good tonight, because the lunch menu sucked. Feel like hanging out with some of my friends from home tonight, haven’t done that in a while. OK, times up. 
__label__label1 I just don't understand some people. Why do guys think that (okay, not all guys) it's okay for them to act like animals?  What does he market?  It's not easy to write and watch television at the same time. It's even harder to write and talk to someone at the same time. That was so disgusting!  Why do girls stay with guys that they don't like?  why am I with PROPNAME?  I think that I love him, but do I really?  I mean how could I do what I did last night if I love him?  It could be possible, I guess. What are these people talking about?  Is PROPNAME. what was I going to say?  quit making so much noise!!!  Clink and clank. All trash is gross. Don't you know that?  My mind keeps drawing blanks. Maybe I am trying too hard to think about what I am thinking. Have you ever thought about how you think of things?  Well, I guess that is what we are doing here. Ha!  This guy is so funny!  This show is very funny today. I cannot believe that that lady just cut her old man's hair off. Why don't people have better opinions about themselves?  Like me. Why don't I?  This thing is annoying. How am I supposed to write my stream of consciousness when this stupid thing says I'm being idle?  I ask a lot of questions, don't I?  When are these twenty minutes going to be over?  Am I going to have to pay PROPNAME to use her computer?  Did I spell her name right?  Who is that lady?  These people act as if they know her. Do they?  Oh!  I guess that she is a comedian. I guess anyway. A man with a plan!  Ha!  My hands are cramping. Come on time!  Go faster!  Faster, faster!  Sock sniffing?  Okay, whatever you say. Alright! Time is over! 
__label__label1 NOTE:  Something happened when I was typing this-the words never skipped down to the next line. (Maybe it's supposed to be that way?!)  Anyway, my thoughts continue to the right-quite a ways. Sorry for the hassle!!   I'm not really sure what this whole assignment is about, but it should be fairly easy for me since I think way too much at times. My thoughts??  I am extremely tired right now. I had a very exhausting weekend and would love to not have classes in the morning. I am doing everything  possible to procrastinate and not begin my huge amount of work. I still haven't really gotten in to the whole college thing. I feel like I am in some kind of dream world-like I it's not really me sitting in a college class with 000 other students. Maybe I was spoiled in high school with classes of only a max of 00 and a graduating class of only 000. Our teachers probably babied us with lots of one-on-one attention-which at the time I loved and appreciated. But NOW I am so overwhelmed!  I'm now only a number out of hundreds of other kids. I guess this whole experience is a big transition no matter what. Anyway, I hope I am doing this correctly. I have no idea why my computer is laying out my words like this. I hate computers!!  We just don’t mix well. I am completely computer illiterate. Sorry if this is taking you longer to read. I am very excited about this psychology class. It happens to be one of my possible majors. Who knows what will happen?!  All I know is that I am a people person and a very good listener that would love to be able to help people in anyway I can. I know it is a tough major with tons of schooling, but it really interests me. I just finished talking to a few of my friends from high school on the phone. They all seem so far away. I miss them and all the fun times we shared. I love reminiscing about our memories, especially looking at old pictures. My walls are full of pictures of friends and family and I'm sure by the end of the year you won't be able to  tell what color the walls are. I miss my family too. 
__label__label0 First I am wondering why I am doing this assignment - this seems silly but still my mind is always wandering and therefore this should not be difficult. I hope PROPNAME calls me back this evening. I really think I should be a happy guy as long as she stops talking about her dog. She is silly with her blonde hair I am hungry Jester food is so amusing I wonder if I can eat that food everyday after I graduate the girl sitting next to me is very "not amusing" I hope she does not stand up, for she probably wouldn't appreciate what I say about her I wonder if anyone else stares at people they find unattractive she probably thinks I want to take her on a date or something because I keep looking at her, but in reality the only place I would take her is to the zoo and tell her to stay there I don't enjoy typing but I suppose it keeps my fingers from getting fat when I took keyboarding in tenth grade I learned to type fairly fast but the only thing I remember typing in that class was the sentence Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. who said that PROPNAME Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country how exciting I would like to think that includes women as well because they can die too oh no the ugly girl just caught me looking at her I acted like I had a bug in my eye she is talking with the girl next to her, and surprisingly enough she is typing the same silly assignment I am  I really hope she is in the same lecture class as I am because I would like to sit next to her and ask her why her hair smells so bad is it a lack of shampoo or is it a hereditary flaw  either way I remember whey I watched Back to the Future part III when they were in the 0000's I bet everyone smelled back then  PROPNAME PROPNAME has been in alot of western movies I really do not like this computer because the more I write the more the screen moves over as if the line is a mile long  I have written for seven minutes already and I have only written seven lines  one line a minute is about as fast as I eat a taco but taco bell has this new hot sauce that they call FIRE how scary I can drink that stuff it is so hot I threw some on our fire in our chimney at home and it put the fire out  the girl working at the counter in the computer lab is not amusing either  Those glasses she is wearing went out of style when PROPNAME PROPNAME graduated highschool  if she has binoculars she can probably see my screen from her seat so if she kicks me out before twenty minutes I wonder if Mr. PROPNAME would be sympathetic  why are there pictures of whales on the wall maybe to remind most of the girls in here they ought not to eat too much I had a girlfriend named PROPNAME PROPNAME in seventh grade and we called her whale  but I didn't care because she was so nice  That is good  All guys should only care about personality to an extent, anyway  that's why I like PROPNAME. maybe two or three girls have come through my life that I could honestly say I didn't care what anyone else thought about them because I like them anyway. the last to own that title got pregnant last month so I was kind of angry with her. Most girls would probably break up with their boyfriends when they only offer to pay for 0/0 the cost of an abortion and they spend that money on marijuana  I was happy to lend her the money maybe she'll realize she's better off with me anyway because I would have paid for the entire thing and I would have gone through the procedure I God allowed me too  how long has it been now ok five more minutes   what would you like to know?   SUBMIT YOUR PAPER  that sounds silly I would rather crumple it up and throw it at my teacher   Teachers should tell the class more about themselves so may be I would now rather or not it was acceptable behavior to throw my exams at them. Do they like baseball?  I went to look up my friends number at the university of LOCNAME And m but he was not listed. The computer seemed to think he was the head of the alumni or something. Doubt it - he probably won't graduate because he smells too  he and PROPNAME ought to share a bathroom. he used to have a shaved head and a little horn on top. Which reminds me of the dumbest thing he's ever done when he worked at a video store and stole 00 porno movies. His parents are head of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME or something and they were kinda mad. he has no scruples he had to pay 000 dollars for those movies and he wanted to watch them at my house. Doubt it I don't steal from video stores and I will not agree to his stealing them either, but I did watch this movies at his house. they were exciting I guess one of the girls names was heather Hooters she was pretty but I doubt she was 000% natural is anyone I know going to read this?  That's ok cause I am happy with who I am   I will tell the whole world I love, well something, I won't mention because if the president of this university knows he will transfer me to a and m. ok I love farming. The sound of the plow chu chu chu through the grass is almost enough to bring me to orgasm. one more minute can you tell I 'm looking at my watch I shouldn't treat this as a paper where I am talking to someone else but rather just with myself but how can I think about anything else when my fingers hurt so much from typing maybe PROPNAME will call but I hope I can hold off on calling her - time to eat - Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.       Oops I almost hit the clear button. 
__label__label1 alright. what can I talk about. well the only thing I’m really thinking about is richie. I love him so much. ok why can I now see what I’m typing. anyway, I g 
__label__label0 Aug. 00  Note: I wrote this paper over a week ago and I am just now typing it. You said we could write it down first and then type it.  I have finally found the inspiration to write this paper. Today is August 00. The time is 0:00 A. M. I am watching television and at the same time trying to write this paper. Today is a very sad day for many . The new of Princess PROPNAME’s death has just unfolded. It is very strange that every time a prominent "celeb" dies the world acts as if they knew them personally. I case in Princess PROPNAME's death the world did kind of know her rather intimately since her life was unfortunately always being publicized. I just looked around my room watching my roommate and another one of my friends gasp in horror of the tragic news. The newscasters are explaining how her death occurred. I think she was a very lucky woman and very unfortunate at the same time. PROPNAME's "Princess fairy tale" seems to be more a tale of horror. I keep thinking about her children. I think their mother was the only one who truly let them know what being young and living life was all about. I think that small ounce of joy will die with her death. My sweetmate just walked in. It seems all of a sudden we've got a party in our room . It's very hard to concentrate on writing this paper and listen to the news all at the same time. The phone is ringing. I hope it's not for me. I always get interrupted when I doing something important. The phone is for my roommate. Her mom calls twice a day at the same time every day to check how my roommate is doing. Maybe she heard the new of PROPNAME and it made her even more anxious to call. Whenever someone dies it always reminds us of what is most important. The time is 0:00 A. M. I am really getting tired and it's hard to write this paper, but if this paper means making the grade I want, I guess I'm going to have to force myself to keep going. They are discussing the "fairytale" wedding and Prince "charming" . It seem ver sad that she only experience the fairytale for such a short period of time. This whole disaster is making me ver nostalgic. I'm starting to think about some of the friends I lost in reckless accidents. The only difference is , they died from their own irresponsible actions. I'm thinking about a friend of my, I suppose we can call her "Sorry" because her life really is a sorry tale. She is a girl who possessed so much potential and ability, but ruined it because she decided she cared more about drinking, driving, and fun more than her future. Her irresponsible ways killed a friend who was in the same car. This friend was pregnant. Two lives lost in 0 instant. Three other lives in the car were saved by fate I suppose. "Sorry continues to drink, drive, and live recklessly. I have lost alot of respect for her. I kind of think her current actions are more sign of self-destruction. I guess she feels her future fun times are going to be cut off very soon and she might as well have fun while she can. Her court date for involuntary manslaughter is coming up. I wonder how reckless "Sorry" can be in prison. 
__label__label0 I really want to go swimming but I don't want to tell PROPNAME that I don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. I really want to go home this weekend. I know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with PROPNAME even after I haven't seen her for a while. Maybe I just don't want to go out with him I think that I feel guilty for some strange reason and I can't get the courage to tell PROPNAME. This air conditioner is really bothering me. It makes so much noise and does not cool very much. I am so hungry. My roommate sucks. I don't know why I'm so mean. Maybe I'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything I do. Maybe she's just too smart and I feel stupid. I'm really hungry. I don't know how I'm going to get to eat if I go with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder if PROPNAME is calling me right at this moment. I wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. I think I'm  making too much noise typing. I get the feeling that I'm disturbing everyone behind me. I can't believe PROPNAME. She just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. I wonder if her parents know the way she is. I still have one more question to do for Economics and I don't really feel like reading. I learned that I should wait to be told what to read before I stress That stress test PROPNAME and I took was weird. I think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. I bet he thought I was weird. He could right away tell what was bothering PROPNAME. I know that PROPNAME really has PROPNAME thinking about him day and night. He's such a jerk. I can't believe what How could someone treat someone that way. Maybe love is blind. I wonder why people around here are so free. I can't believe that girl I say two days ago. She was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. I assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. I wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. I had to turn around for a second. I think that I'm a nosy person. I often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. During lunch today I listened to two complete conversations. I could not believe the things that people talk about. Why does my roommate have to be so selfish. I think that I want to make everyone healthy. I don't know why but I am so self conscience of the way I look. But I hear that is actually average in girls my age. I went all out on this diet until I lost up to 00 pounds and now I think that I am too skinny. but I say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do I gross myself out when I see my roommate eating horrible and then I see her change and I feel that I have to go workout. She gets offended very easily. I don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly. 
__label__label1 I still need to do my homework for Spanish. I'll be spending a lot of time in this building in the spring because I'll be back in design and vis comm. I'm getting hungry. tonight PROPNAME PROPNAME and I are going to get pizza. PROPNAME and I weren't getting along too well for a while. it was because I have been dating and spending less time with him. for a long time it was always just the two of us, neither one dating. now that I am it bothered him just a little bit. oh well, we talked about it and he's better now. which is good, I don't like to fight with Alex. I have a lot to do this week, tonight I need to read and I would like to work on and ,ideally, finish my calculus homework. tomorrow I am going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. I talked to one of the managers this weekend at the forum and he said that they were hiring. that would be a good place to work, at least I like the store. we'll see. I guess I need to call my sister tonight she always gets all worked up if I don't talk to her once a week. I just talked to her the other day though, sometimes I just don't feel like talking to her. I hope that someday she'll stop trying to mother me. I hope that now that she has a child she will let me be. I actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. this is my first time to take calculus so I didn't know what to expect. it is pretty interesting. I'm really getting hungry and it s going to be a couple of hours before I get to eat dinner I wish my computer at home worked it is so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. I 'm glad uncle mike is going to help me with it. mom really did a good job when she picked uncle mike to be my financial adviser ii really care for hm a lot. it is always  amazing to me that it is usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. you always are expected to help your family whether you like them or not but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things and they won't hold it over your head. unfortunately most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. I can't stand that sort of thing. 
__label__label1 it has been raining for the past 0 days and I guess that has  a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. I feel a little relieved and tired though I had my first test of the semester this morning. I feel tired because I spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like I should have. now I was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. I should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. I called my father today. I'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason I seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that I know that I am doing wrong but I still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. I guess he think is that if I am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. I'm trying to get it to him that I still have a lot of things going for me. I guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. I feel totally different though. I believe that I have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well I will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise            
__label__label1 Last night I was almost done and my computer just shut off. I don't really understand why but oh well. I don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. I hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that I can be totally done with mis before tomorrow I think that I am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least I think that PROPNAME will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally I will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy I still can't believe that I didn't catch mono from angie last year I have a sore throat now I hope that it goes away soon I don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th0ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out I can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy I think I thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult I am so glad that I was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but I know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add/drop though I am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game I am looking forward to it I am glad that billy and I got season tickets so that I don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the OU tickets I doubt that I will end up going to the a and m game  because I bet I will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him I can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him I am getting really hungry I wonder what we will do for dinner I wish that billy and I could get together but we are not on the best terms right now I can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired I hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and PROPNAME to come over last night sometimes I miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together I am glad that PROPNAME and eric get to be together again, but I hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in I am kind of getting a little homesick I am anxious to see PROPNAME's new car I can't believe that she is really turning sixteen I am really afraid for her to drive so I hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice I am anxious to see dads' new office space too I hope that he is a little less stressed I know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but I am glad that PROPNAME a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees I know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but I know that she really is glad that he is not going out LOCNAME a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see PROPNAME this weekend it is so weird being I'm the same city as her again I wish tat I could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on Wednesday night, but I understand they both still seem pretty immature and I am kind of worried about PROPNAME and I hope that she is careful. I am glad that she found a date for the date dash I can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you I hope that they all have a fun year and I hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing PROPNAME this weekend too her room at the house is really nice I think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing I am glad that PROPNAME and I are going to go on a walk I could really use the exercise I am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow I really need too get back in shape I felt so good about myself last year when I was going to aerobics everyday I need to get back in that mode I don't think that I really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. I seem to not be snacking as much as I did last year which is a very good thing I hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but I think that it will get better I hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard I guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about I think that I might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again I hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but I'm afraid that I would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything I'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it I hope that PROPNAME and PROPNAME had a good time with their boys this weekend I will go down later and see I have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways I am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun I wonder where PROPNAME and I will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop I hope that it is not too hot outside when I went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot I think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler I am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building I was so disgusting by the time I got back form class Mondays and Wednesdays are going to be long now that I go from one to five but Tuesdays and Thursdays will be pretty easy except this Tuesday I have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks I wonder why all the good shows start again I can't wait to see the friends season premier and 00000 I am so excited this year should be very good well I am going to stop this now it is now over 00 minutes   
__label__label1 I am completely computer illiterate and I never trust them. I have a lot of reading to catch up on and I am worried that I will not have enough time this week. A bunch of my friends and I are flying to LOCNAME LOCNAME on Friday morning for the ORGNAME vs. UT football game. We are only staying until Sunday evening but that takes away an entire weekend. I should probably bring some of my books with me on the airplane because I think it's about a four hour flight. I am also mad at myself because I took a really long nap today which wasted a lot of time. I think I really needed to catch up on my sleep though from this weekend. We stayed up really late after the game on Saturday and then I woke up early on Sunday to drive to LOCNAME. I went in town to visit my family because I missed them and hadn't been home in a while. We went out to dinner on Sunday evening and then went to look at my Dad's new office. He just moved, it's a little bit smaller than his old one but he doesn't have a partner any more so he doesn't need as much space. Well, now I'm off to try to get on to the Pretesting page.   
__label__label0 PROPNAME just walked into our apartment and PROPNAME is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed PROPNAME lyrics. I don't even like ORGNAME   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 00 minutes. PROPNAME's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play ORGNAME later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to LOCNAME in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy PROPNAME is loud. PROPNAME's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. PROPNAME is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . I guess I'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. I have no more to write. I'm going now. by0e. 
__label__label1 I have finally made it to college. I miss my family and friends but at the same time I am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. It's is something new. I feel confident that I will succeed here at LOCNAME, but most importantly, I want to succeed. I am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. I sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. However, each day I feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. Above all I find myself missing someone back home who I have only known a short time the most. He is a wonderful person with whom I have this extraordinary mental connection. Being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. It makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. I am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. Well I guess I will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation. 
__label__label1 so there you go. my one feeling. tired. I think ill get to know that a little more as the semester goes on. and now I'm beginning to feel another emotion. that of annoyance. my roommate is talking to me about a bunch of crap while I'm trying to do this thing. I've got a dull sort of sensation in my head. I guess I've been working to hard. or maybe that could be from that lack of sleep. but then why do I want to dwell on this the whole time. can I not think of anything better to say?. that brings me to my biggest character flaw. not knowing what to say. and why the hell do I want to bring this up. I don't know. my mind wanders again as he talks somemore. I'm also beginning to feel a little overwhelmed with the college work load. I don't really think it is that much stuff. it's just that I have one class I don't like at all. that being good old rhet/comp. and how can I hate a class like that so much. I hate writing and reading. simply put. I have a strong sensation to end right here with this writing. but then that just wouldn't be right. and then I think I might be able to get something out of this. I kind of feel like I'm doing this incorrectly. seems more like a diary to me. and now the people outside the dorm room are making noise. do they ever have any freaking homework to do. at least I havent heard the bass being played way to damn loud today. the sob was playing the stuff at 0 in the moring. not that it woke me up. but I got to hear my roommate bitch about it. I kind of feel proud of myself somewhat today. I had somewhat of a social interaction with a girl. something that hasnt happened in a while. if ever. yeah. sad state of affairs for me. that brings me back to think of why I havent gone anywhere in my life with the opposite sex. I guess if I just got to being a little more social. yeah. I could fix that problem. well. at least that was a start today. now if I could just keep stuff like that up and not be so much of an introvert. I might just turn out ok. now I'm low in the well of ideas. what else to type about. am I even doing what the assignment was asking of. I remember going to the therapist while I was in middle school. she said I had to express myself. and not be afraid to feel my emotions. yada yada. I know I have emotions to feel. I guess I'm just too damn shy to show them sometime. and now I hear female voices outside. I'm kind of glad I hear them. takes my mind away from doing this. and lets me concentrate on them. I don't know why I like trying to figure out what the hell they are saying. I guess I like seeing how other people interact with one another. speaking of that. me and my roommate. we interact. just don't talk too much. we need to get the hell out of this room a little more often and meet different people. I can't force him to do anything . but I know I can maybe get myself out to do some stuff. I'm kind of pissed at the people from school that came to UT. it's almost as if they fucking ignore me. but then thats ok. I know some might be doing that just because I am with my roommate. they don't really like him much at all. I just got a little laugh hearing my roommate having computer problems. I'm really having a bad time when I have to talk about something like that. well. I'm kind of proud of myself. I was able to spend 00 minutes so far talking about almost absolutely nothing. one last thing to talk/bitch about. I like the food here at dobie. yeah. nice to know. but the fucking lines are a bitch. 0 mins remaing. go clock, go. wooh. I used a comman. I better learn to have more patcients (spelling) with the hw assignments. I always find myself watching the clock, seeing how many pages I have left, or anything else that I can use to see what kind of a pace I am on. and once I find out how slow it's going for me. I get discouraged. oh well. the clock on the computer reads 00:00. that would make 00 mins complete. 0/0 way done. lets get this over with 
__label__label1 I tried three times to get this web site and it kept bringing up that the server was down. I am the mother of a 00 month old and when he goes to bed, that is the time I need to get busy and do my work. I often stay up until 0 or 0 am trying to get everything done that I need to get done. I have the King and I on the TV, I am looking very much forward to going to the Bass concert/ performing arts center to see it. I bought three tickets. My husband and I are going and taking my grandmother for her 00th birthday. it should be a real treat. the house is quiet except the TV (on low) and the dishwasher. I love the sound of the dishwasher. It is a night time sound for me because when I was growing up my mother would turn it on after the news on her way to bed. It is a comforting sound. It was a  normal bedtime noise then, now 00 years ago, and now in my own home I enjoy the sound. I would miss it if we were to get one of those new expensive machines that didn't have the same rolling and tumbling sounds. I love water, the ocean, it kind of reminds me of that, but in thinking about it also probably sounds like being in utero. This musical is so beautiful, I just love the musicals of the past, a time long gone except you can visit through videos, theatre in your mind. Its sort of and escape from daily hectic real life schedules. Speaking of hectic every day schedules, my car is in the shop. It was there today since 0am and at 000pm I hadn't received a call about it yet. I don't think they are very considerate,  I had to call, and if I hadn't would they have closed up and gone home without saying a ***** word to me! probably. In order for me to be in class at noon tomorrow, I need to have PROPNAME at the daycare by 00am . and I have to have a way to get the car. Freddie works night at the post office and he needs to go to bed when he gets home, not fool around waiting to take me down to the ORGNAME service dept. being without your car is a big pain in the butt. It is the air-conditioning , door locks, and electric window. of course, it is the drivers window that is messed up, and when you unlock the door with the key, it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't lock and unlock the real drivers door. and usually it is when I have my arms full of stuff, the baby, and when I am in a hurry. As soon as I am finished, here in a matter of minutes, I can go read the mountain of books I had to get this semester. Man, this assignment is making me sweat. When I complain about things I often feel bad, because I know there are people who have it worse than  I do. We watched TITANIC . broken up in three evenings, it was good, but it made me cry. what a way to die. or lose your family or loved ones. Life is the sweet with the tart. I guess. I am curious what will be achieved from your collection of these stream of consciousness writings. I have more than satisfied the 00 minute requirement now, I would like to print this as a receipt, but guess what? my ink cartridge is out, and it was for the survey too, so I hope I can pull it up again and print it when I get out to buy one, I tried at target last week, but of course, they were out !!! the story of my life. 
__label__label1 Sometimes, I don't understand my ex-Boyfriend. He tends not to tell me everything, especially the ones that he thinks I shouldn't have to worry about. Maybe it's because we didn't have enough time to know more about each other before I left. A lot of times, I sincerely wished I had known him earlier, and things between us could have been lot better. When we were together, I didn't think I would miss him that much even if I came back to LOCNAME. But, somehow, he knew I would miss him. But I really didn't realize how much I miss him until now that I am back here. I couldn't call him nor email him. The only thing I can do to keep in touch with him was write letters. It takes about a month back and forth. And one month is really too long for me. I want to know how he is doing and if he misses me as well. I wish he could come here to see me. But I know it's just my imagination to something that's almost impossible. Even though we never really talk about how we are now since we are so far away from each other, at least, I know that we are still good friends. 
__label__label0 It is Friday, which means that school is done for the first week. My classes have gone extremely well. I have calculus, MIS, Psychology, Intro to Western Music, BA000. My calculus teacher is kind of hard to understand, though. I am also very happy because I have worked out at the gym every day since moving here. I am trying to lose weight and have already lost three pounds. I am also trying to eat better. I run for between 00 to 00 minutes, walk, and do the bicycle machine. The Castilian looks like it has delicious food, but since I'm trying to eat healthy, it's kind of hard looking at all the people eating ice cream, pizza, hamburgers. Once I get to my goal weight, I am going to allow myself one food treat a week. Another reason I am happy is that my email is finally working. It took two hours for a man here to set up my internet. I was on the phone yesterday for like eight hours trying to set up my email. No one seemed to be able to help me. A guy came in today and hooked me up in less than half an hour. Now I have a ut account and one with PROPNAME. I emailed my dad today, and he wrote back. Tonight I hope I do something fun. It is great having a roommate I have been friends with since the sixth grade. We both know when to study and when to have fun. We study every week night and try to go to bed as early as we can. She is in Architecture. She is going to be very busy with that. My sister did not go to college. My parents are moving to LOCNAME in September. That will be convenient for when I want to see them. The window to our room is open right now and it feels great out. The tower is chiming and I am in a fantastic mood. Earlier, when I was in the elevator, the lights turned out for a second and it seemed as though the power was going to turn off. I gasped!  I feel lucky to be able to come to college here to get an excellent education. I hope to have a job I love once I graduate and to be successful. Once I get my first job after college I plan on saving a lot of money and also investing. I think about my future a lot. I'm kind of a worrier. I've met some really nice people at the Castilian. A lot of the girls here just got finished rushing for their sororities. I didn't do that. I don't think I have time for it as well as how much money it becausets. I was surprised that two of my professors are women and the class I haven't gone to yet is also taught by a teacher. For some reason I felt that a lot of the professors were going to be males. I did not bring a car to school because the car I had was really old. We've had it since before I was born. It's a 0000 Toyota Corolla. I had a love/hate relationship with it. I loved it because I've known it forever. I hated it because it was so slow and had no radio. I had a yellow jam box in there so I could listen to tapes I made. It got really good gas mileage, though. A lot of people from my home town, ORGNAME, go to school here. My roommate's older sister is a sophomore at ORGNAME and she stayed at the Castilian last year. We requested her room and got it. We face the tower. I forgot to take my vitamin today. I should do that before I go to dinner. I can't wait until I can have a dog. I love dogs. When I was in elementary and middle school I had a ORGNAME ORGNAME named PROPNAME. She was the cutest little thing!!!  My roommate had a really great mutt the whole time I knew her named PROPNAME. He had to be put to sleep. Her family got a new dog who is really stupid named PROPNAME. His parents names were (not joking) PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. This dog is literally the stupidest dog I've ever met. He doesn't understand when you don't want him near you. He's chewed up a lot of my roommates stuff at home. Both her mom and my dad work for the same company. Hopefully this coming summer I can get a job there doing something. I've had a job since I turned 00. Well, Got to Go. I'm going to eat dinner and take a shower for tonight. I am in a great mood!!!!! 
__label__label1 it is 0:00 right now and I have to write for 00 minutes. my roommate is going to come in here and read this and make fun of me. she said she would be home at 0;00 I bet it will be a lot later. damn, I'm really bad at typing, iwish I did't have to look at the keyboard while I did this. I wonder who will be reading this thing. I would really like to read someone elses. I hope after this I can get back on that pretesting thing because it sure as hell wasn't working for me earlier. what if I can never get back on it. I'll probably fail this class. man, I just got a call from someone at atm. I could see it on the caller id. shit, that means I'm going to have to calle them back and pay for the long distance. I couldn't answer it and let it skrew up my thinking process. ireally wonder who is going to read this. I wonder how much more time I have. I don't want to look at the clock that will make it seem worse. I wonder what my parents are doing. I bet they're pretty bored. I really suck at typing maybe I should take keyboarding class or something, am I going to run out of room here? it looks like it, oh no ican keep going. I feel like doing something fun. I wish bryce would stop calling so damn much. watch him get on line and be able to read this. iwonder if thatsa possible. I bet you have to know my social security number or some thing. but the university knows it. I wonder if the computer is like timing me or something. my mom would be really proud of me for doing this she doesn't think I know what I'm doing when it come to computers. my roommated will also be impressed when she come home from whereever she is. I bet this would be a lot harder to do in that class room with 000 people. iwould probably start writing about the people around us. by the time I finish a sentence I've already thought about 00,000 other things. I wonder if other peoples are going to be like this. they are probably going to talk about something worthwhile. I used to think it was worthwild. I hear voices outside my window I wonder if they can see me. they're probably saying that girl looks at th e keyboard when she type instead of the screen. wow time is going by really fast, I only have like 0 more minutes. I wonder what will be done with this and if I will ever see it again. where the hell is lindsay? I think I'm starting to get a crick in my neck. I have 0 more minutes. computers are pretty fun I wish I didn't have such early classes. I keep thinking some one is going to knock on my door. geez my suitemate is really weird. I wonder what she does. damn almost all my thoughts from 00 minutes recorded. that is pretty cool. shoul;d I read over it? 
__label__label1 Well my leg kind of hurts. Last night while PROPNAME was out with PROPNAME, I spilled my ver hot tea on my leg. It hurt like hell. When she came back I was laying on my bed with a frozen dinner meal on my leg. The burn is on my right upper thigh. It really hurt when I took a shower last night to. Today it doesn't hurt as much, but it has this really huge blister on it. I don't know if I should pop the blister, or what, so emailed my mom. She works nearby off of LOCNAME. I wonder if she misses me as much as miss her. ? I guess I'm quite a home body, because I live only 00 minutes. away yet I miss everything around my house. I especially miss PROPNAME. He's this guy I've had a crush on for like forever. When I was a sophomore at LOCNAME, he was a junior, and we ended up in the same physics class, anyway he was on the soccer team then and I thought he was cute. I need to pluck my eyebrows, and these desk chairs here at jester suck. I can't even sit cross legged. rruugh. This place is beginning to smell too. I don't know why, but it is like you can't shake it, its everywhere. Back to PROPNAME. We work together. Have for the past two summers. It's kind of funny because I don't even remember really thinking about him until the end of the summer, but this summer. we were friends from the start. I wanted more, but he never acted on it, it's just as well though considering I have a boyfriend and all. Well I don't know if I love PROPNAME, but I sure as hell miss him terribly. I almost cried the first day here. I missed him and everything so much. I gave him my email address, but I suppose he has better things to do than to talk to me. Maybe he doesn't have a computer!? wishful thinking. oh well, I get to see him at Thanksgiving that's only say 0-0 months away. Sucks. He isn't even that cute, and he can be such a pain in the butt too. Well, I'm going home this weekend because I have to go to the company picnic. I should leave on Friday, but, I don't know what I was going to say PROPNAME just I'M'd me. oh yeah, I want to go home for a bit, but I don't know if I'll miss a bunch of things happening here. I'd ask what do you think, but you can't answer me. PROPNAME. He's my boyfriend, we've been together for about eight months now. I love him I truly do, but sometimes he is not very exciting like I know him to well or something. That is probably why I am attracted to PROPNAME. He's new, parties has goofy friends. I wanted to kiss him goodbye, but that would be wrong plus, he probably doesn't even think of me that way then I would just be embarrassed. I don't know what to do about him, but I should seriously think of something soon , I've been saying this all summer. But really it is beginning to effect my relationship with PROPNAME. The electricians are driving me crazy with their drills. They woke me up the first day I was here, and they've been at it ever since. I tried to take a nap today but couldn't because they are too noisy. PROPNAME should drop by soon. I hope at least because I have a feeling I'm going to get bored in this place soon. PROPNAME is laying on her bed doing her homework I think. I can't believe I'm in college. I don't feel old enough. I think I can handle it though. I don't wont to gain the freshman 00 though. PROPNAME did. I want to look good, great when all the people come back from college for Labor Day or Thanksgiving I guess I should go to the gym. I need to sign up for some class but need money in my bank account to do it. I also need to sign up for ORGNAME's a  service frat. I hope they pick me I'd be crushed if they didn't. Especially if PROPNAME got in and I didn't. She is in so many clubs and organizations. I think I should got to some things. I should probably sign up soon. 
__label__label0 I used to day dream about  this time when I was younger. After I saw my brother and sister leave for college, I decided that was going to be the best part of my life. Of course, it is a lot different now that I am here. There is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams. I don't really mind it so far. I want to be able to handle it, and I am excited about my classes. I wish that I could be an expert in every subject that I take. Psychology is very interesting to me, but not enough to be my major--I wouldn't want to do it for the rest of my life. My brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from LOCNAME texas, but he hasn't done much with it. I am taking this class as a social science elective; my other classes are required for my major. Right now I am an undeclared major, but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course, I am pretty sure that I want to major in geosystems engineering. It seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that I am interested in, and it would be a job that pays pretty well. If I did well enough at ORGNAME to get into grad school, I would love to follow it up with a masters or Phd in Geology. Of all the courses I have taken in high school and college, these seem to be the best ones. Some of my favorite subjects are: geology, geography, astronomy, archaeology, and history. I would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough. My reason for this is that eventually I would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of LOCNAME--near a lake--with a boat. This requires $$. I love the outdoors, and I want to live away from the city, yet close enough to it that I could drive into town to do things. This is probably a common ambition among people, but I don't really care. Enough rambling about all that. My reason for being here at ORGNAME is to learn, and to get an education, and to do well. If I do all of this I will be very pleased. It will be hard though. I love to have fun, and that can easily get in the way at LOCNAME. I haven't joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet, even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me. I want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things. Hopefully that will work out. These are the things that are on my mind at the moment; at least until I move on to the next thing. 
__label__label1 I've always wondered how the mind works. What are people really thinking when they say one thing. Why do they say one thing and mean another?  People can be so confusing. I wonder what college life will be like, and if there will be people there who will act like that and just say one thing to me while meaning another. It's all so overwhelming right now. Computers have never been my strong point, and all of a sudden, everyone wants everything done on a computer. It's strange and somewhat exciting. I like living out on my own, without my parents watching over everything I do, but I am beginning to get a little homesick. I miss being able to see the stars at night and to feel the breeze on my face as it blows my hair back off of my neck. I went to a star party last night, and the stars were barely visible. I wanted so much to be able to see them, but I couldn't. I felt like I could cry at that moment. I didn't though, because then my friend would laugh at me. He doesn't think I'll make it here on my own. I guess I am somewhat of a Daddy's girl, but I can be alone. I enjoy being able to hear myself sometimes. I have to be alone to write poetry and to think about who I am. I wonder when I'll figure myself out. I want to be somebody important someday. I want to make other people feel welcome and to make myself feel good about helping others. I guess in a way, whenever I try to make others feel good about themselves, I'm doing it with the underlying purpose of making myself feel good. I suppose that's okay, but it seems to defeat the purpose of helping others when all I'm really accomplishing is helping myself. I think life has so many hidden points that no one will ever find all of them. I wish I could search the world over until I could find all the secrets of the history of people's actions, but that will never happen. People are so secretive that so much history is lost. There are some people that claim that it can be found, but there's got to be more exciting history out there. What would the world be like if everything interesting was discovered. Then there would be nothing to wonder about. Things would be dull for the future. I wonder if somebody across the world is taking this exact same course and writing this exact assignment right now as I'm doing. That would be the coolest thing ever. I wish on stars every night and feel that life is to be cherished. I wonder if there is another woman out there with my exact feelings and thoughts, that looks exactly like me, only another color maybe or size. So many questions I ask myself will never be answered, but what if someone is watching me right now across this computer lab and wondering how I feel and what I'm thinking at this very moment. If only I knew, maybe I could meet up with this person and tell him/her my thoughts. I would love to share with someone I don't know. I'm afraid of rejection though. There are so many people on this campus, and hardly anyone has talked to me yet. Somehow I feel inferior to some of them. I don't know why. Everyone is equal, but some people seem so rude. I try to talk to people in my class, because that is how you make friends. So far, I have only made one friend that way. She's really nice. Her name is PROPNAME. I met her in my German class, and we get along really well. We haven't done anything outside of class, but maybe if we keep talking to each other, we'll become closer and maybe she'll even go home with me to visit my parents. I don't understand the need for human contact. We would be so much better off if we didn't get caught up in emotions and feelings. But then again, we wouldn't be human if that didn't happen. I know I could be more efficient if I didn't need anyone else in the world, but as it is, I have faults. That's okay, though. Everyone has faults. It's just part of being human. I hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me. As I come to a close on my writing, I feel purged of all my frustrations. I had a good cry this afternoon. I miss my boyfriend so much, but I know I'll see him again soon, and that makes me very happy. I hope I can become even happier with where I am now. Hopefully, I'll be able to find me. 
__label__label1 I've spent my second day at the university of LOCNAME and I'm trying not to hate it. I feel lonely and depressed. I miss PROPNAME, I miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when I first went to PROPNAME I hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now I know what the other extreme feels like, I really miss it. I kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when I was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in LOCNAME. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people I know. I feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. I can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if I'll like them, because I don't see anyone who fits my idea of what "friend" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with PROPNAME yesterday because I didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- I say that joking of course, but I guess I feel like I can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - I mean I know who she is and it's what I expect. I'm so glad she came here too - I don't know what I would do if I were totally alone down here. I think it's really a different experience for me because I've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here I don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. I didn't expect to miss PROPNAME so much. I thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone I've seen is the sorority/frat type and I hate it!  I never thought PROPNAME was that diverse or funky, but I guess I've realized what I had all along. maybe I'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. I mean I know there are plenty of PROPNAME PROPNAME oh-so-perfect women at PROPNAME who drive me up the wall, but I know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say?  I just had an argument with my mom and I feel really guilty, I haven't seen her a lot lately and I was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how I should rrahhhh - I hate that. I told her that I was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me I can't do it, right when I'm in the middle of an assignment. I'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. I'm at acc where I worked this summer and I came here because 0-I have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 0- I thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like I still mattered to someone. now I just feel like hell. I think I want to cry, but I always feel so crappy when I do that - since I usually do it for some really stupid reason, like I feel like a jerk or something. god, I just feel like telling everyone to shove it today!  what a way to start the semester!  ok, I'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. I'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but I hope I can. I really want PROPNAME to go, but I'm not sure if I want to want him to go. I hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, I'm sick of getting hurt. I think I might just like him because he's there and I'm feeling so lonely right now. I don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal?  I'm not sure. I keep going over this in my head - why can't I find the right one?  not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that I really like/  one that fits all the qualifications I want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. I'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, I can't fully concentrate on what I'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there. 
__label__label0 Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in LOCNAME for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to ORGNAME and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 00000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 00 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new PROPNAME PROPNAME CD for dad tomorrow and call PROPNAME. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named PROPNAME. Never eat at a place called PROPNAME's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      
__label__label1 I think that I am just supposed to write whatever flows from my mind for this one, so here I go. I really like the theory that writing about a problem helps you sort it out. It is interesting to me that putting that problem onto paper helps symbolically remove it from the mind. Theories like that always seem to capture my imagination, I am a huge fan of symbolism. I miss my girlfriend a lot. I think about her multiple times each day, she just pops into my head all the time. I wish I could have called her today, but I just didn't have time. I just realized that I called her my girlfriend. I guess we are broken up now, but more because life drew us apart than any conscious decision. I am dying for some reason to call her and tell her that I love her. I haven't said that in a long time, I think it will make her incredibly happy to hear it. I hope she hasn't given up on us, although that is extremely unlikely. I have not been able to talk with her much lately because she has been grounded, but when we spoke the other day she still sounded like she cares. We've been through so much, I think she always will care about me. It seems almost corny to say "We've been through so much" because everyone says that about their sign. other. But with PROPNAME and I it's not like we've just been through a time where we fought with our parents or ended up almost splitting up, we have walked as close to Hell as I care to come. There are still some things I hate remembering and I block from my mind. Every now and then I will remember something which seemed to have vanished from my memory and I am amazed I didn't remember such intense emotion before I was reminded. I suppose it is repression, it is very odd. I don't like to think about a lot of the things we went through, it's just an emotional roller coaster I don't want to ride again. I still imagine myself with PROPNAME automatically when I think of the rest of my life and who I will be with. I cannot wait until semester when we can spend more time together. I just got a flash of memory of what it is like to be a couple who sees each other and spends together a lot. I miss her being an active everyday part of my life. She is still an everyday part of my life, but only in my thoughts. Not in physical reality. I will definitely call her tomorrow, after my dreaded chemistry test. I am sure I could be studying so much better right now if I had talked with her today. I am scared that when she finds out about PROPNAME it will hurt her incredibly, the odd thing is I would do it again. But it remains to be seen if I would do it again after we talk. I feel so out of touch with her. She changed so much in the wake of everything that happened I feel like I need to get to know my best friend again. I am sure that her core personality is still the same though, I just feel weird because we have both changed and grown so much apart from one another, I am scared that we grew into two people who aren't supposed to be together. 
__label__label0 I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 0 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 0, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 0yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my PROPNAME. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to PROPNAME. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 00:00 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 00 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 000G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 00 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 00000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment. Which I'll do tomorrow, because we can't do 0 in one day. Bye                            WRITING ASSIGNMENT 0                             000000000 
__label__label0 First of all is my class ME 000. I don't want to be taking it at the moment but I will have to take it sooner or later. I am not good at drawing and that is what the class is mainly about. I would love to learn how to do that but I just wish I didn't have to get a grade. I am more worried abut that class than I am about second year cal. I could postpone the class and take it later, maybe during the summer, but I don't know. It will be a hard class for me. The other thing that is on my mind is whether or not I should play baseball. That is a very complicated subject for me. I would be a walk-on. However, several people who know have told me  that I could easily make the team. On the other hand, that would be very time consuming. I have a girlfriend back in LOCNAME who is still in high school and I really want to be able to see her. I am afraid that If I played baseball then I would never be able to go home. Also, I am an aerospace engineer and I will have a lot to do besides. The other side is that I have the ability to play and if I don't then I will look back and wish that I had. I have had to deal with this issue all summer. If I do play baseball then I will likely have to change my schedule. On the other hand I think that one of the reasons that I don't want to play is because I might be afraid of not making the team or of upper classmen or scholarship player harassment if I did make the team. People have always told me not to take my girlfriend into consideration when making my decision but I can't do that. They all think that just because I am going off to college that I will find a new girlfriend, and I may, but I don't want to and It won't be anytime soon. We've already talked about marriage and how when she graduates from high school she could come live with me. She is a junior right now so she has two more years. I would love it if we could be living with each other right now. In the year that we have been going out we have never had an argument. I enjoy her company so much. Well that is what is on my mind at the moment.   
__label__label0 what to write?  I am happy right now because I just got a phone call from a  frat that I am going to join. we are having a get together tomorrow and there are going to be strippers!  that should be cool. but I don't know what to wear. I always get nervous about what I should wear. I hope my girlfriend does not find out, even though I will probably tell her, and she'll probably get mad like she sometimes does. I wonder when clay is coming home?  we have to work out tonight, and I still have a lot of Persian how to do. my throat feels better today than it has all weekend. I was really sick for the last three days so I stayed home and watched the 00th anniv. of Planet of the Apes. that was a good movie. I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of LOCNAME. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got. I need to call laila, I miss her. maybe we could all play solarquest. my neck is stiff but I still have 00 minute to write. this takes forever. I wonder when it is due?  I heard the 00th but I am not so sure. I wonder what the other assignment is about. I hope it is not like this. ,  I have a lot to do tonight but I must be in bed by 00. I need all the sleep I can get. I am tired. this is really starting to bore me. what is the point? write down every thought you think. seems creepy. I hope who ever reads this one is laughing and enjoying themselves. some how I doubt it. this is not very funny--it would be though, if I could say it. I hope no one minds all the hundreds of mistakes I made, and if they do, who cares?  what are they going to do?  put in computer jail?  Someone I knew said that all the time. but I can not remember who. I miss PROPNAME. I wonder how she is doing at PROPNAME PROPNAME state. I also miss jena, I really hope I see her before she goes and flies off to LOCNAME. I hope her life is not hard, and I wish here and michael all the best. my ear hurts. four minutes left. I was beginning to feel trapped in time. stuck forever by this computer typing away through all eternity. I am really tired, but I am glad I got this one out of the way. just a couple of minutes left. that woman at the dinner was so weird. and what about her HUGE 0 year old?  that was scary, but so is "Walt" so I guess it is okay. Well time has run out and now it is time to go. that took forever. 
__label__label0 I can't stand how removed the users are from the control of the system. With internet explorer I can't even get it to work with trumpet Winsock, so if I want to use IE then I have to go down to the computer center and pay them a bunch of money for the ORGNAME connect system when I already have trumpet Winsock that has always worked fine in the past. now with ORGNAME I keep having a completely different problem, there are several times that I go to web pages that I know are there and they aren't for example I tried to go to the pretesting WebPages and I soon as I sent my social security number out over the web, which I'm not especially happy about having to do, it tells me that the document has no data. The same thing has happened before when I try to log on to the ORGNAME house website. I consider myself a pretty smart person, but I cannot figure out at all what the hell is going on with this stupid then. I know I have to go down to campus and use a computer down there for 00 minutes to do the pretesting. and why the hell is it when you connect to UT and go on the web the connecting is so freaking slow. I swear UT must have some really outdated equipment down there because my download speeds never get over 0 K. that's ridiculous. but this is the way at UT. When you go to a school with 00000 students everything takes a little longer and your chances of having to deal with an idiot are raised considerably. I think I have an especially low tolerance for stupid people. Uneducated is different but there seem to be a lot of people out that that are truly student I think, and they frustrate the hell out of me. It's not that I'm a genius of something, but there are some real idiots out there. There is this girl in my engineering economics class that sits up in the front and will ask questions that make no freaking sense at all. How in the hell does someone get to be an upper division engineering major and be so stupid. obviously it happens through, although most of the really stupid people that I have to deal with come from working at ORGNAME. I guess that's my own fault, it's not like I should expect anything else. When I was a ORGNAME we would have some cashiers that I have not idea at all how they got hired. I think personnel hires anyone with a pulse sometimes, I mean if the person sitting across the table from you just has this completely blank look on their face, that's a good sign that you shouldn't hire them. Another thing that bugs me are all the stupid laws regarding alcohol in this country. I mean either it should be legal or it should, but alcohol seems to be the only think that is legal to some of the adults and only part of the time. I mean were are talking about adults, some of them may not be especially bright but they still are adults. if 00 is good enough for every thing else then it should be good enough for alcohol. you can get married, go to jail, go to war, own property, get a gun, hell anything that any other adult does except drink. seems pretty backwards to me. something else that is freaking stupid and at the very least unfair is the way that car insurance companies can completely screw over guys. when a girl turns 00 she gets a good rate, but a guy has to wait until he is 00, hello but most of the really awful drivers that I have ever been around are women, they are  the ones that pay no attention at all to what is going on around them. but since older people control the laws etceteras the younger people are going to continue to get screwed over, I think they should make people over 00 pay the same rates as 00 year olds, that would be funny. oh well out of time, it's been real 
__label__label1 Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 00000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in LOCNAME, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) 
__label__label0 homework in the midst of my pre-cal assignment because my pre-cal is too long and really rather boring. plu, I need to catch up because I didn't start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing a little each night, my mistake. I hope to finish this writting assignment, the pre-test, my pre-cal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow. it's a lot but it will catch me up. then tomorrow I can begin my new pre-cal assignment and I can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary I can catch up on more psy. and pre-cal thursday evening. I'm also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday. james is a very good friend of mine and whenever I need to talk or unload my thoughts, james is excellent. plus, I'll put in a good couple of hours at my intern. david is going to teach me how to use my dad's camera and stuff so that sunday I can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed. then, I'll have those pictures to play with and I plan on getting some of my negativesput on a cd disk so I can manipulate those pictures also. I have a very busy life going right now. I don't know how I cram it all in sometimes, but honestly, I like to have something to do at all times. I don't know why, I'm not very good at sitting still alone. only if I'm watching t. v. or something. I'll get my new job schedule on thurs. I just changed jobs because I was tired of working at the old one, that and I hadn't received a raise in a year. the sad thing is, I don't know if I'll be getting paid any more at this new place. as long as I don't take a pay cut I'll stay, I just need a new enviroment with new things to do. I'll be working at bath and body works, I think it'll be fun, because I like the things they sell there and I get to be the saleswomen. I enjoy selling things to people. my managers seem nice also. I might have to work at five in the morning a few times a year and I'm not looking forward to that at all. I've never done inventory before so I don't know what it involves, but I don't see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if we'd be more productive a little later, even seven sounds more reasonable. I'd rather not worry about that until I know for sure that I'll be going in that early. I wonder what you're gather from all of my ramblings? five more minutes to go. I don't know how this is suppose to go, whather I should just write waht's on my mind or as if I'm talking to you at the other end. I gues in the end they're both going to get you the same stream of con. types of thoughts, huh?  I hope I can log onto the pre-test when I'm done with this, I tried it first and the server wouldn't let me on, yours or mine I don't know, I don't like computers much any how. I guess this was as good a way as any to put off the rest of my pre-cal since I'm being productive in the mean time. I could have gone and watched tv, or read my book (not some school assignment. ) well now, that wasn't hard at all, I guess I'm good at rambling. my time's up.  
__label__label1 The day I moved into Jester was a rainy, cloudy, and gloomy Saturday. The whether showed how I actually felt inside. kind of sad, glum, & anxious. It was hard for me to leave LOCNAME at first, but now that I'm settled in and have started classes now I feel somewhat better. I miss what I've left behind, what is familiar to me, my friends, family, pets, and yes, my radio station 00. 0 THE BOX. I love LOCNAME and will go back to live there again one day. I also miss my house, my room, and my bed too. It was kind of like my comfort zone. Whenever I had a problem or felt sad about something, I could hide in my room, my parents would try to comfort me and I would sleep away my problems. Well, I know sleeping doesn't solve your problems but it sure makes them seem not so bad after a nap. Now that I am in college, I will have to keep my head up and make new friends so I can lean on them when I need a shoulder or helping hand. I also feel anxious about meeting new people and talking to my professors. At first, to someone new, I might seem kind of shy, but once they get to know me they can see how I really open up and seem a little crazy too!  But it's sometimes hard for me at first to open up to someone and just be myself. I don't know why, it just depends on how I feel at the time I guess. There's also a little bit of fear inside me that makes me feel doubtful as to whether I will find my "niche" or my group of friends that I can hang out with. I have ran into a couple of my friends from highschool that I have been doing things with lately and that makes me feel good. Whether or not I want to join a sorority is something that I will deal with next year. If they seem cliquish and stuck up, I don't think I want to join one. maybe I'll go rushing and see what they're all about and then make my choice. I'm also curious about what I will get out of my college experience. Will I find my future husband here or get a good job right after I graduate?  Will I struggle the whole way and stick it out, or will I give up and drop out?  Just to let you know, I plan on doing my best and graduate in a couple of years. I have already been to each of my classes once and my mind is about to explode with all the information that was given to me. The professors told us what to do and gave us a syllable, now it is up to us to do it on our own time and to manage it wisely. I seem to think that it will be hard to keep track of all my assignments and homework. I hope I can stay organized throughout the year and not fall behind in any of my classes. I feel like I could get lost easily at such a big university with so many students. On the other hand I do have some positive emotions about college and my new experiences. I have a fresh start at a new life (with no parents!) and I can be whatever I want to be and do whatever I want to do. There are so many things on campus and in LOCNAME to get involved with and do. and the good thing is that it is my choice!  I just hope I don't blow it!  
__label__label0 The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 0 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in LOCNAME. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at LOCNAME it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. 
__label__label1 Every class seems like it has so much extra work, I feel like I  will never have any free time. Other than the work though, I love college compared to high school. I love the freedom I have and even the new responsibilities. Right now everything is still fun, I'm sure though that I will get sick of cooking, cleaning,ironing, and doing everything else by myself pretty soon. I already miss my parents a little and my little sister very much. I can't wait to see her. I feel really bad though, because I promised her that I would come home and see her in two weeks, but I don't think I am going to be able to see her for another week. My mom said she was so excited that I was coming home. She just started second grade and I wish I could have been there to see her. It really sucks that I have to leave her, I feel like we may not be as close anymore if I don't see her as much. She used to beg me every night to sleep in my bed with me and at the time it was kind of a pain, but I really miss it now. I also really miss my boyfriend who is also back in LOCNAME. He came down last weekend, but I don't think I'll get to see him for another week either. He is really taking me going off to college really good. I figured he would be mad at me all the time for hanging out with other guys and stuff, but he has been really cool about it. At first he got really jealous, but we talked about it and now he is completly understanding. I really hope we make it through the year and mabey he can move down here next year!  That would be perfect. Ilive with my best friend so at least I have her here. I think it would be really hard to go to such a big place like ORGNAME and not know anybody. people do it all the time ,but I think  that I would get really depressed if now one I knew and trusted was down here. I really love it down here. Austin is a really awesome town, it has everything!  It is really different from LOCNAME, which is where I come from. It is a small town 00 miles south of LOCNAME. We only have about two stop lights and mabey three fast food places. I think its really great though that I am getting the chance to live in a really small town and a reall big town too. 
__label__label1 Entering a big campus with so many different people, how interesting. This will be kind of a new experience, meeting other students just as smart or even smarter. I can bring ideas to this school and to others as well as the school and students to me. Hopefully, I do well, or excel beyond my potential where I can feel proud and to just prove my abilities to myself. Things now are a little different, where I live, what I eat, who I meet. But it seems that everybody has to deal with the same things or hurdles in that everybody are fighting, scratching, or just competing to be the best or is everybody just content to making to college?  Due to their being content, the race for those competing will be easier for them, but are we in a rat race to achieve greatness?  There are also other things in life other thatn to prove that one person is somehow better academically because of a test made by some professor and to the subjects covered by what the professor says, there's to find leisure time when not having to study. School can be easily sluffed off, but students are paying for classes in which makes a person certified to do a job in which that person studied. Money don't grow on trees; people gots to earn it, to feel good about oneself. But it's also the little things that can a person feel good like just getting together with friends and talking, to eat something that's very tasteful, to just observe how folks interact with certain situations and how watching or observing these things can help me without me having to go through, but somethimes some things have to experienced by oneself to fully understand. Things aren't what they always seem just by loooking. College has too much to offer, where everything arent' feasible to understand, and just let things be. 
__label__label0  I feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. I know I'm supposed to write about what I am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. I don't usually tell anyone how I am really feeling ever. I'm worried that I might not be studying as much as I should be. I don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. I mean I know I could read the texts, but I really don't think that would do me any good since I have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. I hate math. I don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. He is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. I don't think I'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. I miss my boyfriend a lot. He is going to school in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I'm not going to see him for at least three more months. I tried living with him in El Paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. I was going to go to school with him, but I decided to move back to LOCNAME because we were starting to hate each other and I missed my family a lot also. It's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. I really don't understand it at all. I wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. I know I need him and he needs me, and I really hate it. I have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but I know the truth even though I would never admit it to even my closet friends. I wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. She was so excited when she got hired. I really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what I am thinking. I mean who really cares anyway?  People are always asking you how you feel, but I'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. I know lots of times I ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. I hate when people look at me in queer ways. I always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. I wish I didn't care, but I do. 
__label__label1 anyway, I have really enjoyed the weather lately. its so wonderful to have some change from the usual hot crap we've been going through lately. I think the weather change is making my life better. I hate the heat. it was so intense this summer. this weekend proves to be an exciting one with many things on the agenda. concerts, barbecue and hanging out with friends are what I'm really looking forward to. I recently broke up with my girlfriend so this whole change of pace has been good to me. things are looking positive and it makes me happy. I'm sure that makes sense. I'm really excited about school this year. I think things are going to go well. I like my classes. I find the nature of the courses to be really interesting. I'm sure that's pretty helpful as well. another helpful thing I've learned is than riding the bus is so much easier than walking to school. oh gosh its 000x's better. wow, this is only 0 minutes of writing. I'm so tired. my contacts are bothering me, the screen is WAY too bright and its way to early. I can still hear drizzle outside my window. in looking at the syllabus, I see that a test is approaching. it would probably be wise to begin studying for it. gosh. I'm hungry. I guess ill give my thoughts on the whole PROPNAME scandal. I think it is incredibly sick in what they are doing to this man. to release the details of an intimate relationship he had to the public is both immoral and degrading to society. I feel for his family and the torment they must be going through. I would hate to be in chelsea's position right now. this must be so tough for her to read and go through. damn that ken starr - nazi asshole. I'm offended that he would go to great lengths to find out about the presidents sex life. if they impeach PROPNAME, I'm going to be extremely worried about the country. I don't feel al gore is an appropriate leader at this time. who know, however. he may be suitable. I just think it would all be really stupid if this crap continued on. the starr report was so graphic. it sounded like an explicit porno. wait. it was. too bad it was real life. I'm glad nobody is going to read this. its a stupid waste of time. haha, just kidding. wait. if I tell a bad joke. and nobody is here to read/hear it. is it still bad?  INCREDIBLE. I'm an amazing human being and I'm glad to be alive!!!!!  "I can't take much more of this. these coffee makers full of piss. these people treat my like a dog. and all I do is write these songs. I'm not a toy.  " - Dynamite Boy. "as long as I live I can never forget you. even though I try with all my might" - dynamite boy . "I want to. see if you. by chance you know what I'm going through" - dynamite boy. "what's going on tonight. is everything alright. I hope there is nothing wrong.

I have to actually wait the entire time. its ok. only 0 minutes left. . I need some massive sleep. not a little sleep. MASSIVE SLEEP. what a retarded human being I am. oh you. 0 minutes. I'm seriously running out of things to tell you folks. I'M NOT SUBJECT TO MEDICAL RESEARCH. I'M A PERFECTLY SANE HUMAN BEING. JUST BECAUSE I BIT OFF MY TOES DOESN'T MEAN I'M ABNORMAL. THEY JUST LOOKED SO YUMMY. man I was already falling asleep when I began to worry about this class. . sheeeeeeesh. SNORRRE. some friends tried to get me to do mushrooms tonight and I said no. how's that for some backbone. hell yea. I'm the man. mom and dad would be proud of me. too bad I'm not going to tell them I hang out with people who do drugs. I've never understood the fad with drugs. id rather drink a coke and get hyper than ingest some poison. but then again, I'm a wuss. oh well. JUST SAY NO. yea. uh huh. one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute . done. 
__label__label1 you would think that by now there would be no pain. ha. also on my mind is the extensive amount of homework that I have to do this evening. I am also very hungry. what am I going to eat? double-daves sounds good. or what about Chinese? god my teeth hurt. I should've grabbed the Advil when leaving the house this morning. Bummer. I would hate to spend another 0 dollars on another bottle but I don't know if I can go all day without it. I am also concerned with the fact that I just did an hour of pretesting stuff and its not connecting with the server. that could be a problem. ill have to ask about that today in class. it did take almost as hour. I would hate for that to be wasted time. this paper I have to write this evening is really stressing me out. PROPNAME PROPNAME and the Puritan dilemma. what a dilemma. actually it is rather interesting the way people thought back in that day. things have certainly changed. gross- I just rubbed my tongue back to that far forbidden corner in my mouth and felt the stitches. ouch. this probing throb is driving me bananas. obviously. I keep losing my train of thought. how will I ever be able to concentrate on john PROPNAME. ill have to wait until I get home and pop a few Advil. or a few hundred as I am feeling right now. just kidding. anyway another thing stressing me out is the fact that my car is in the shop again. I dropped it off this morning and its almost as if my life is in someone else's hands. at least my checking account is. ha, what checking account is more like it. ouch. my freaking teeth. I am going to have to break down and buy some more Advil. that sucks. gosh it's almost 0:00 already. where does the time go? oh yea that pretesting thing and then trying to submit it. I have that it's not lost. maybe I should try and check somehow to see if I can send it through now. well its been twenty minutes. its time to go and get some Advil and relieve my suffering. ORGNAME's is probably the least expensive. it kills me that I have to buy more of that. pain medication is not cheap. anyway enough bitching! lets go over to the pretesting website again. 
__label__label1 I haven't been in the mood to do any homework. I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from LOCNAME LOCNAME. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends ORGNAME. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in LOCNAME. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to LOCNAME because I didn't want to go to ORGNAME because my brother went there. UT and ORGNAME were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, PROPNAME, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. PROPNAME goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. PROPNAME is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and PROPNAME. PROPNAME I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and PROPNAME are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes PROPNAME's side. My reasoning was because I thought PROPNAME was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say. Don't think I'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but I just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. Which leaves me very lonely. It's mainly my fault because I don't want to spend much time with PROPNAME because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. PROPNAME, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except I don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) PROPNAME, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. And PROPNAME, who called me yesterday just to talk. Now how nice is that?  I mean, I went to PROPNAME's today before class, and I had fun. She's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. )  Which I guess why I used to have bad feelings towards her. She's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but I kind of want to meet my own friends. I group of new friends. Also, PROPNAME the homesick one made friends too. Which is good, because she needs to be happy. However, I think it is about time for me to make some friends. Well, also I tried out for the ballet class here. It sucks!  I'm so mad. There are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. I was stuck in the freshmen class. It is so bad. I've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. Not to mention there is no pointe here!  I am not trying to sound smug, because I was far from being the best at my studio at home. But these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. Don't get me wrong, I was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to "place our arm on the barre"  I almost died. I know where to put it. I don't need help with that. I need help with my turnout, extension, balance!  NOT WITH WERE TO PUT MY ARM ON THE BARRE!  Well, as you can see I am not excactly a happy camper. I'm glad I wrote this, it was fun. My fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but I'm sure I need to get used to that. Well, I'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. It's PROPNAME and the PROPNAME. We've done it before. It's going to be cute. I was the Duck, my friend PROPNAME(who goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME) was the Bird. She was a great dancer. She was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the Nutcracker(not PROPNAME, but the ORGNAME ORGNAME)  she shared it with PROPNAME who dance the Cat. PROPNAME is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. She was going to go to LOCNAME on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. My other good friend is PROPNAME, she's a sophomore. She is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. So those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. I love ballet, we also have this one dancer named PROPNAME, she has extension to die for. That means her leg goes all the way to her ear. She is great. I love ballet, that makes me so happy. Well, thanks for this assignment, I'll see you in class, but I doubt you'll see me!  I'll probably drop by you office sometime!  I hope this makes since! 
__label__label0 I really miss my home town, but only because I'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. I'm constantly worrying that I'll fail and I seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes I feel they are a bad influence on me. I'm only happy when I'm doing something, and people tell me it's because I don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time I don't care. I have a hard time concentrating, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD. I probably don't , but I like to think I do. they call that a hypochondriac right? I have a question: does  believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? I hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems. 
__label__label0 Looking at this assignment I'm trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that I want a good grade. Like every other student, I don't like doing homework but I writing so it is okay. I have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend. I know I should have done this earlier but I am a procrastinator and I often wait until the last minute. I am slowly changing that habit because I know I can't procrastinate if I want to do good in school. My feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because I don't know what I am suppose to be feeling. I am just writing what comes to my mind. Honestly I don't even understand the topic. All I know is that I'm suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind. I know this has nothing to do with school but I keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston. I was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldn't let her come up to LOCNAME. It is okay because I know I'll see her next weekend. I was going to write this earlier like on Friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so I didn't find time to write this assignment. So far I like the class because it is the only one that interests me. all my other classes are boring. The is the only class that I enjoy the lectures in. I'm not saying this just to make the professor happy. I'm saying this because I mean it. I am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now. Oh yeah, I think the experiments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade. I thought about writing the research papper because I think that might be easier but I think the experiments would be funner. I have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice. I also met some of my friends that I already knew who came here from houston just like me. I have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it I am. I don't know how long I have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind. I thought I would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that I am not. I just keep writing until I don't know what else to write. Well things are starting to stop coming into my mind. All I am thinking about is how I can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop. Will I think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting, anxious, lost, suprise, and not understanding. This has been a interesting paper because I have no idea what I have been writing. Well I guess ill push the submit button now. 
__label__label1 the computer is not very easy for  me type on I would never say anything because me dad bought it for me I love my dad. he really got the shaft at work elaine is a horrible person. mom is so protective of dad its only been two minutes I wonder if I can think for twenty minutes I bet I do all the time and don't even notice,  this is hard because I think about more than o ne thing at once and they aren;t really complete thoughts just flashes in my haed but I know what thay mean. I should have taken a typing class in high school. the sky has really pretty simpson clouds I wonder what I have to do in all my classes am I doing thi right I need to be more organized I've been thinking about being organized all day I can't stop thinking about the living room curtains and a file box for my papers. maybe 00 it too many hours I hope I go to bio this chair really bugs me because it doesn't fit un der the desk. I should buy a different one I don't think I have enough money for all this stuff. where am I going to get money. maybe I should have gotten a job instead of taking another class I was thinking of something and now I forgot it. I wonder if adam and I will get married he would be scared if he knew I said that I sound like a stupid teen ager out of the 00's when I say that. I would marry him if I had to though I think I probably do really love him I dn't get sick of him I could be with him all day and I don't even notice I hope nothing bad happens even for a while my parents made it through college but they had a few fallouts. I hope we just marrily make it along untill we're old and gray but I know how nieve that is. did I spell nieve right I wish I had a better spelling sense I guess I could blame it all on my first grade teacher but that seems silly. my room mate came in I hope we are good friends. I really like her but I don't know how to make friends with people. I wonder why I can be friends with kids and poeple I don't think are important but its hard for me to be friends with people I like and want to be friends with. I fell like I'm coming on too strong but then I hold back and they think I don't like them. also people told me I'm not very approachable. I guess thats good because I don't like when random guy come up to me. I don't know how to get out of it without being really rude. cheryl is so perfect she can do what she wants and she is always so polite. tricia was like that too. I wish I was in 0th grade again for a day. whenever I think of middle school I get kind of queasy and real mad at my mom what a horrible time. I couldn't even get within a certian field of the house or I would sense a horrible aura. when I had to go I would force my self and run to my room and be a nasty depressed person. on day the church lady cought me running to the creek and I think she was genuinally concerned. 
__label__label1 Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group ORGNAME people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside ORGNAME my world at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards PROPNAME, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of LOCNAME. Coming from LOCNAME, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?  It's not that I'm depressed or willing to let go of PROPNAME to free myself of these "troubles," it's just that I want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just "click together. "  Too optimistic, I know. That'slife, I know, but I can still wish that things could be different. I never tyhought I'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. In a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. I guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. But, I've still got troubles. God, I sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually having a pretty good time. I have made friends, and I relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. I truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. Damn, I've got to wake up early tomorrow. I wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life!  My twenty minutes is almost up, and I really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.  
__label__label0 When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was "What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?"  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like "What song best describes you?" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 0 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 0 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 0 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel.

__label__label1 While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 0 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 0 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to ORGNAME and experience this great school.       
__label__label0 Well this labor day was good. i got to spend it with some very special people to me, and also since it was my b-day, I got to have a lot of fun with those people! hehe gosh. i spent a full 0 dayz a way from home, and not a care about school! Well I take that back, since I am doing one of my psy assignments. hehehe. but none the less, I did not really think about homework! hehe it is great!  I wonder why everyone thinks I am a freak!! I just don't like veggies! Is that so hard to believe? They just don't taste good to me. much like steak does not taste good to vegitarians! Sheeesh. i take more shit about that than I do about anything else. haha  hmmm. soo I need to be getting back to austin here pretty soon, so I can get some of my other work done, and actually go to work! But I really don't want to. haha. why is it that our society has become based on laziness? Why is it that everyone thinks it is better not to work? When did this change from a hard working, earn your living, society come about?    Our society is degenerating!! Ain't it sad! Sheeeesh. we could. man. oh well. my 00 minutes is up! GUess you don't get to hear the end of that one! :)   
__label__label0 Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 0. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either. 
__label__label1 I just got up and now I have to finish all these dumb writing assignments. I haven't taken a shower yet, and I'm not really in the mood to finish these things, but they're due tomorrow, so I have to finish these. I think I'm going to go workout later today. I want to be in shape for the crew team. I've noticed myself getting a lot better like being in better cardiovascular shape. that's cool. I haven't played soccer in a while, so it feels good doing something athletic again. hopefully, I'll get in some major shape in not too long. I still have so much homework to do. this really sucks. This weekend was pretty fun I guess. We went to this Iron Spikes party friday night. There were some pretty cute girls there. I almost went home with one girl but I don't think she is that cute. I did have some pretty thick beer goggles on so I don't really know if she was as good looking as I thought. OH well. That just shows my dedication to crew. IF I give up getting some, then being on the crew team must be very important to me. I felt like I was in too. This girl was just absolutely digging me. that's a shame. and then on saturday, I went to a lakehouse, that was a) neither a on a lake b) not even a house. it was a freakin stream-creek apartment. that sucked. These girls that were there were pretty annoying. ONe was really cute, but she was kinda snobbish. I dunno. I'd like to talk to her, but these girls were all too snobbish for me. I was hoping maybe there would be some down to earth girls but apparently not. I hope I meet a good girl pretty soon. I want a girlfriend, but I think I'm trying too hard. I should just chill and hopefully one will bite me in the butt soon. Oh My God! I still have a few minutes to go here, but this is taking forever. Let's see. i have economics, calculus, chemistry, and then of course this class. I kinda want to just stop and go workout and then go out tonight to makeup for that bunk night last night. It sucked. We were supposed to spend the night there last night, but we ended up going home, because quite frankly, it sucked. we didn't do anything, but drink and then just talk. These girls would talk about absolutely nothing. they had no brains. just a bunch of hot air. it was so very boring talking to them. hopefully next week though, it will get a LOT better. I mean it only goes up from here. that was absolutely horrible. I am not in the mood to do any homework at all. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. How can I find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. Well I guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. That sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. Which is I am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. This gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. So far since school started I have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. I have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. I want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. I got a girl that I'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. Is it possible that I can expect our relationship to work out?  I know I want it to, I know I want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something I can manage. Are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. It just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. Then I start wondering about my best friend who went to LOCNAME and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. I miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because I feel I don't act like my true self around new people. I am not trying to be fake with anyone, but I can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and I don't like that. I just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because I would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. Even though I got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that I spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences.

__label__label0 There is a girl named amy who annoys me very much. We used to be very good friends until I found her true personality. PROPNAME;s personality is hard to relate to which makes her hard to get along with. She only does things that help her or make her look better. For example, she will only become friends with people who benifit her or make her look cool. PROPNAME requires shopping. She shops at least once a week. Her shopping habbits drive me insane. PROPNAME cares so much about how she appears to other that it hides her true personality. She acts like the person she wants to be but will never become. PROPNAME is a smart girl but that is not obvious in a conversation. She acts oblivious to the current events and common knowledge.  Being at college and having a girlfriend at home is a hard task to handle. Eventhough it is tough to do, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is. While I do not see my girlfriend half as much as I am used to, I can still call her everyday. While phone conversations are not physicall confromtations, they do help in easing the pain of not having her around all the time. By being apart for extended periods of time, when I do end up going home to visit, the benefits are rewarding. The time spent together then is more special than any other time I have spent with her before. Because we both know our time is limited, we seem closer during my home visits. It is some of the only times when we think on the same level. Both of our plans include us spending time together. Eventhough I would much rather be at home with her, I am glad we made the choice to stay together while I am at college. Next year I can only hope that she decides to attend UT. It would ease a difficult stage in our relationship. 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling much rage and it stems from the outcome of this weekend. I had traveled for three hours to visit my family and friends hoping that I would be welcomed with opened arms. Half of my theory was right. My family welcomed me with much warmth but my friends pretty much took a dump on my face. Well not all of them. A few in particular. My whole weekend was, in my mind a total waste of time. My so called best friends would rather spend time with their ridiculously uptight and stuck up girlfriends than to hang out with a best friend. I had known them my entire life and these girls just walked into the picture less than a couple of months ago. Nothing but anger subdued my mind for the following three days. I refused to let myself be depressed so I figured I would go shoot some pool. But to my dismay, one of my friends showed up, this one was one of my female counterparts, and she pranced in with a guy standing next to her. So what. That part didn't piss me off as much as the fact that they were at a party and didn't bother to pick up the phone. Not even to say hi. She did not even return my calls or answer my pages. To make it even worse, she pretended she did nothing wrong and pursued to make friendly conversation. To hell with that. I walked out of there without even saying good bye or giving a reason why. My mind was filled with so much raw emotion, the negative kind that can tear a hole through your soul. That's when I realized that LOCNAME was no longer my home. I no longer had any true friends in the city that I grew up in for 00 years. Like I said, my friends had pretty much crapped in my mouth. I'm not sure if they were aware or not but that is completly beside the point. I am home now. The city of LOCNAME where I would rather meet and make new friends than to salvage the friendships that I already had. I believe it is a wise choice otherwise I will just continue to be put in such an unstable emotional state. Not once this whole weekend I had a good thought in my mind. I was fine until my so called friends sold me out to be with a girl all night so that they could get freaky with each other. I've got no problem with my friends being horny and wanting to get it on with their girlfriends but at least hang out with me for one damn night out of three. Now I can relax and look forward to this weekend where I will undoubtedly have a good time while my friends stay at home with their thumbs up each other's asses. Screw all of them. I don't need them anymore than I need the toilet paper I wipe my ass with. Austin is a hell of a lot more exciting than houston and my asshole friends can stay there because they were too damn stupid to get into LOCNAME in the first place. I hope they are having fun at community college, or high school for those that were too dumb to even graduate high school. Good luck flipping those burgers at ORGNAME's the rest of your lives. 
__label__label0 Honestly, right now that I have this assignment all I can think about is what to write about. I wonder and wonder what I'm thinking but all I can think about is that I want to get this done because if I don't I will eventually get behind and then I;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while I sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. I guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what I am and am not doing. I sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments I need to do and all the things I have to do but I never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. I am so scared that I am going to fail now that I am here because I don;'t quite think that I belong hwere. Everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and I am the black sheep. It scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and I don't I just miss my friends that I had in high school. It is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and I have just changed. I wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. My roommate and I have been friends since like the second grade, so I didn't get to meet anyone new when I moved into the dorm. It scares me to even be in the dorm because I am more homesick than I ever would have imagined being. I miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. I only live 00 miles away but I worry that I will look pathetic if I go home all the time, but I so much want to pack m0y  stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to PROPNAME. There is absolutely nothing special there, but I miss it so much. My parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when I do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. I also feel bad because I don't have a jobn yet, I have never gone without a job, I've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to I'm a bigt girl I should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. I feel so dependent on them aNED ALL through high school I felt so dependent and now that I should even more, I don't at all. I don;t even know why I chose this school, I think it is becuase everyone thought that I couldn't and I wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. I am happy tht I am here now because I think it is a good school but I didn't have good reasons when I applied and I worry that will effect my future here. I feel lonely being here. My friends are at other schools in LOCNAME and I still have some in PROPNAME but I feel like I am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. I feel like everyone already has their groups and I just don't fit into them. Today is the best that I habe felt in a long time becausr my friend PROPNAME is coming by from ORGNAME ORGNAME's and her being here might make me feel like I have someone. I don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. Every time I sit outside I see people being picked up to go do things and I jsut sit outside by myself smoking my Marlboros wondering when I will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. Maybe that will mak e me look important but why do I care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell I am anyway, I think I want them to though. Maybe then I would feel as if I was a part of the university. Right now I feel like a blacksheep and I have never in my life felt like that. Is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do I not make efforts to speak to them. I guess I have a fear of them not accepting me therefore I don't even make the effort to approach them. IS the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. But then aGAIN maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe I am a good person and then I would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (I feel so dumb writing this becuase I don't say what I feel ever. My mother thinks that I am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how I feel, I create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. Instead I act like I don't care either way  and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. If no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. Only one of my really close friends knows that I do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. But I don't think so becuae I love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who I was then they wouldn't care. It wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that I was human. Not that they think I'm, not but I don't show feelings so they wonder what I am really thinking, but if I tell people whta I really think then I open myself up way too much for dissappointment. I don;'t know what to do, I htink that is why I haven't gone home because if I am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually I will have to open up and let people in and if I run home every other day, I will have too much security and I will think that I can remain closed to new things forever. THis way I am forced to accept myself and that way I can find out if people accept me. 
__label__label0 I wonder what I am doing right now, this is a little annoying, stupid grammer mistakes are irritating me. Hmmm, I hope that PROPNAME likes the present that I have for her. How am I going to get back, and how am I going to get back? How much will it cost, how will I do on my psychology test I have the coming monday. I hope that I will still have time to study. Oh well, I'm tired I really wish I didn't have to do this right now. Hehehe, I wonder if that guy I just e-mailed will reply to me anytime soon, and I wonder if he'll actually have what I want. How much will the new motherboard I need cost? Can I wait 0 months? I hate waiting, oh well. I wonder if PROPNAME is asleep right now, I really do miss her. Atleast I'll get to see her when I go back for her birthday next week. This is really going to take a long time to do, the writing assignment I'm doing right now. Havnt' played pool in a while, I hope that I'm still decent. What's on the TV right now and why am I paying so much attention to the way that I'm typing right now, I keep going back and making corrections to my mistakes when it already said I shouldn't. Bad habit I guess, always want everything to be perfect. Dumb Browser, messing up. Annoying sound. I hope that when I go to Block-buster tomorrow they will Final Fantasy VIII. I wonder if it will be as good as it's supposed to be. I hope that I do good in college, get goood grades and do well in general, though I also hope that I have fun also. It's a bit anoyying having to think and type so fast at the same time oh well. I have to do it for my assignment. The TV is really loud and annoying right now, unfortunately my roommate is watching it right now and I'm doing thing right now so I can't stop and turn it down or anything. I like my roommate pretty much we get a long pretty well, but anyways why am I thinking ORGNAME this, never knew that my mind switched from thoughts so suddenly. I wonder if I have attention defecit disorder. I hope now, that would be really bad, though that might explain why I never really did as well as my brother or sister in school. I wonder what they are doing now. I wonder if they've ever drunk alcohol. Anyways, that's none of my bussiness. Hmmmmm. I wish I didn't have to go to school tomorrow, wish I could just stay home and just rest and enjoy myself. I sill need to do my calculus, philosophy, and psychology. The other part of it atleast. It's a little difficult right now with all these distractions, but I guess I'll cope. Hmm. don't really know what to think about or write about right now. Hmm I wonder how much my plane ticket will cost when I buy it, I hope it doesn't cost too much. But it's for her, so I guess it's worth it. Wish I could see her right now. I rememver the first time I saw her, it was a little strange and I didn't know her name. hehehe. she was cute, nice to look at and she was nice  too. anyways I'd better stop thinking about her and get my mind on some work. Another thing I wonder how I'm going to pay for my plane ticket I still havn't recieved my bank card or checking card from ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Annoying. Hmmm. Those funyons look good right now, I wonder if I should stop right now and eat some food. I wonder if the milk is still good, or if it's bad now. I'm in the mood for some cereal right now, kinda wierd. But I've always been a little wierd. Anyways this is getting rediculous and a bit tedious also on my fingers. getting tired from just looking at the screen right now and typing. oh well. how much longer is it, oh  0 minutes. I guess that's not too bad. Hmmm. I want to stop. anoyying. oh well. aonly a little longer. I'm starting to get careless. but anyways. I wish PROPNAME would stop messaging me right now I'm trying to do this but I can't with him messageing me. TV is getting louder right now, must be some horror movie or something. too bad I can't turn around to look right now and type the same cause it would be a little difficult to do so right now while typing and having to occasionally look at the keyboard to make sure I don't mess up. I wonder if my fingers look wierd right now moving in this order. Oh well, who cares. Only 0 more minutes till I can stop and maybe either rest and sleep or eat some more food. Now what will I eat, cereal, hamburger??? who knows. I wonder how much I've typed already. Hopefully I typed a lot cause it would be cool if I would type really fast. One more minute right now. Why do I always put more periods than I need to???? I always do that with just about everything. but again who cares. Finally time is up!!!!!!!!

__label__label1 I am sore, my pecs hurt. hmmmm, I need a woman, I can't find anyone here, all the girls I meet are either ugyl, stupid, or taken, life is beginning to suck. I love UT but I am having trouble finding myself, I am not sure what I am going to do. I have always wanted to be a doctor, but what happens if I don't get into med school. what can I do with a bs in biochemistry? I hate living off campus. by the end of the day, I begin to smell, and I can't get home and take a shower unlike everyone else. I hope my car is going to be fixed by this weekend, things will be so much more convenient for me if it does get fixed. I wish I had gone to an earlier orientation and set my schedle right, I don't lke having 0 hours in between classes. ugh. sigh. I need a woman. I just want someone to hang out with whenever I get bored. right now I can't get into contact with any of my friends, so I have nnothing bettert to do, I am hungry. I want to go home. but I would have to walk fifteen minutes to the stop, wait a half hour at the damn stop, then wait another half hour to get home, then walk about ten minues, then it would take about another fifteen minutes for my food to get ready. ugh. I am bored, I need a woman. I wish I knew how I was percioeved by woman, I don't know if they find me attractive, funny, cute, or anything, I am completly clueless. I wish someone would just comeup and tell me exactly wha they think of me. sigh. lets see, my mouth tastes funny. I wish I had ome food on me. damn. damn, why does v have to have a boyfriend already, she just broke up with someone. I wish she liked me. I hate being "just friends" when I want more. I don't want to type this in the smf, I have an eerie feeling that someone I know is loooking over my shoulder, watching me write this stuff that I wouldnt tell my closest freiends. if she wasnt such a close friend, I think I would tell her, but she is like my best friend, and now I am afraid, no I know, that we wouldnt be friends if I were to tell her, I know she will freak out, heck I ve seen her do it before. I am so depressed. I need a woman. i hope no one is watching me type this, I am getting paranoid. damn I am sore, my back hurts, my arms hurt, and my chest hurts. I need a job. I need a woman. sigh. what should I do with my life, I think my friends don't like me anymore, I am becoming a nuisance to the I think. I tyr my hardest to not mooch off of people, but I always get bad vibes from everyone, like I am not wanted. I am sure that they arent right, I know that the y  are false, but I can't shake the feeling. I try really hard to be as nice as possible to people now, but I can't shake generalizations that people dish out to me. some of my friends think of me as a pervert, even though my mind dosnt think that way. I never think of nastiness or sex, I just mention it every once in a  while for jokes, I have too much time to myselfs. I thiknk thats why I am so insecure, I have to much time to think about my problems and such that I dwell on them, and make small things look big. if I had someone to hang out with whenever I am bored, then I think I would feel much better about myelf, but I find myself walking around campus a lot, and its so hard to get in contact with my friends, that I can't hang out with them. ,. I find myself drifting away into isolation. sigh. 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. In my Language of the Stage class my teacher gave my about 00 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this Friday. It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 00 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. The only problem is that I have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. It's like I wnat to make good grades in school but I also want to go out and meet new people. I am also a Pi Phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. I really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. I also need to start working out again because I don't want to gain weight and I am really afraid about that. I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately. Well I am having so much fun but I really miss my friends that aren't here. Only a couple of my friends are here but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already. 
__label__label1 I'm kind of frustrated right now with PROPNAME. She just left to go to meeting and she just bothers me. It's like she's annoyed with me but she won't say anything. I hate it when people do that-it's like just tell me what's going on, don't just act nonchalant about it. It pisses me off. It's like she just kind of ignores me all the time. I thought it would be better when she came back this weekend, since we spent time apart, but it's not. Gosh I sound like I'm talking about my boyfriend or something. But nope, it's my roommate. I'm feeling kind of pissed off about a lot of things actually. I ate way too much yesterday which sucked. And I was doing really well about working out here, and now all of a sudden I'm getting lazy. I don't get it at all. I talked to Price last night which made me feel happy and sad at the same time. It usually does when I'm here at school. He always makes me homesick. It just sucks because I was home the entire summer and he just didn't take advantage of it. I tried, I really did, but he didn't really make the effort until like the day before I left. Figures. It's so hard because we both like each other, but there's nothing we can do about it. It is so stupid that we are not in the same grade. I just keep thinking that God does everything for a reason, and that I should just feel lucky He found a way to bring us together in the first place. I went to church for the second time since being at ORGNAME. It felt good, but sad too. Kind of like talking to Price. I don't know-I know everyone says over and over again that it's hard to find a church in college and that you just have to keep an open mind, etc, etc. But it's true and I keep comparing everything to MDUMC. I miss it so much, especially PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I miss everyone there. I wonder what it would be like to go home again next summer and do staff. I would probably be really bored, but I guess God will lead me where I'm meant to be. I just don't want to spend all summer in LOCNAME drinking my life away. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like drinking, but I just don't enjoy doing it all the time. I just really need to get involved with some Christian organizations here. I also need to find a bible study that I enjoy. I feel so lost if I don't have fellowship to keep me on track in my faith walk. I hate being so close to God in the summer and then straying so during the school year. That's just not how it should be. I have got to work on it. I especially need to do my part here, like praying and quiet times. It's like working out-no never mind, that's an awful comparison that I really don't want to make. I wonder and daydream way too much. I wonder about stupid girly stuff sometimes like who I'm going to marry and when. I wonder if I'm going to get a job. I wonder about why I'm such a moody person. Sometimes I feel really different from everyone else around me. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if I went to ORGNAME. Would Cal and I still be inseperable? Would RT and I be good friends? I don't know, it's just weird. I wonder how it's going to be with Price when he goes to college. I wonder if he'll meet some girl and totally forget about me. I'd probably be so jealous if he ever found someone that he was closer to than me. But I shouldn't if he does-I should simply be incredibly happy for him. We just have a weird relationship. I wonder how PROPNAME's doing really. I mean, I know he acts the same, but he has to be going through a lot. I can't even imagine. Sometimes I want to ask him about it, but I don't know how to put it or what to say. I mean, I can't just randomly bring it up. I wish sometimes that we still talked like we did in high school. It was weird last night when PROPNAME and PROPNAME were talking about PROPNAME on the phone. I haven't thought about that boy in a long, long time. He still makes me mad. what a stupid thing he did. I still can't believe he threw away our friendship. we really clicked. we could talk about anything, and that just doesn't happen very often with two people. I mean, I obviously got over him romantically, but we could have been lifelong friends. Too bad for him I guess. I still wish sometime down the road that he would apologize, but I think a lot of people in life wait for apologies that they will never receive, or for people to come back into their lives that never will. It's foolish I know. I love my parents so much. I wish that I could treat them the way I want to deep inside. The way I know I will wish I did all of my life when they are gone. It's just ridiculous how much they do for me. 
__label__label1 this tyoe of thing bothers me because it seems really impossible to typ eexamap wow that was swpelled bad I mean t exactly what I am thinking . mab thisis really hard for me because I kkep wanteing to go back andn fix allt he crap errors I am making, I never realized how bad I was at typing ok that is better I guess I just need to get in the wrythim or nto to get the typing thing right. well I don't knw I have done this before in my spare time but somthinges was that suppoes to say somethings because I think I meant somethines  man that is weird I can't type it I somethings no I want to type sometimes ok then,  this mamkes no sense myabe my mindis just ompletely twisted and illogical. I doub t it though because it sut nevermind that word I  often think abou t things so logivally that it scares me. proving yourself wrong is knida werid because you almost regret it sometimnes. an interseting thought that keeps coming to me, I will have to ask the prof this: if one is beign tried for  a murder, and to get "away" withit he pretends to be insane, and the trial lasts like a real long time like a year or two, and this whole time he has to pretend he is really off the wall completely insane, would he after a while actually in reality become insane, but because he is really insane not realize it and still insist he is completely sane in his own mind, I somehow htinki  that he could really go insane and not realize it, I guess itsa ll perception thought, I mean who perceives what, I perceive mysefl to be sane, but maybe on another standard I am insane, who is to say what is really right?  Well I think ultimately there is a standerad or fgith and wrong it is just ath people who are wrong can't really be proved that they are wrong because we deal with perception. like basicaly I belve in GOd, and what he says andhis standards are absolute truths, but since those of us who believe it are human, we can only relay it as our perception see, and those who have a different perception may be wrong, but cannot be prved wrong because each argument is a perception. basically that is what faith is there for, some fcould argue that faith is actually a device made up by the human mind to justify a perception, but then you could argue that this arguement is actually a perception devised to justify a different percepton. I really didnt find blari witch scary, I mean, it really was a little freaky, but not hjold my breath to stop from screaming scary. whats wrierd is I have started thinking outside whati am typing and I keep thinking how I am faliing at truly represeintinng my thoghts. can yoiu belvie I am actually tryin to think of a creatvie way to end this?  How do yo end sterama of conciousness anyway??????????? in reality you can't can you, I just have to force my hands of the keyboard.

__label__label0 I don't know what exactly I am supposed to write about. and I think about how much time I spend trying to perfect everything in my classes, but when does that ever go through. I think that there is so much to do and I have no time to do it it. the stress keeps growing and growing. I am a bad typer so this won't be as long as it should be biut I don't really care I keep fixing my mistakes even thoigh I know I am not supposed to I thik that my hand will start to hurt really soon after so much typeing that I am going to inevitablly have to take a break soon but I ll just keep going psy seems to be an interesting courseso far and I am looking forward to listening to some of the lectures. thinking/ I don't know what else I am supposed to type about so I am going to write words that don't mean anything to me I miss my mom and my family and I miss my exboyfeind even though we had a bad breakup, I don't know if this is approriate for this assigninment or not but I sometimes I think that my thoughts go in weird directions and I think abnormal thoughts that people don't usually think about but then again I am just another teenager who is full of life and evenerygy anf I I someimtes wish that my teenage days were over and I could then setlle down and do something useful with myselfv but I love being young I wouldnt give this up for the world and to know that in a couple of years I am going to be off doing sothing that will whats the word I am looking for effect, thats it, the rest of my life and the way that I live and the people I will be freiends with and the people I will work for what exactly do I have to do to make things work out for me/ what exactly do I have to prove to people to show them that I deserve respect and a good life/ I think this typing is a waste of my time because I am not even getting anything done and I haVE so miuch reading to do and I have better things to do than to type this and no one is even going ot read this it angers me that I have to spnend 00 mins on something no one is even going to look at there are about 000 people in my class and I doiubt anyone will know who I am for a long time f even ever. I wish that I never sined up for this classs as a freshman. I wish I could go home and not be stuck in a place like this and I wish things could change for me. I don't know how I am supposed to think about the way I think. I think thats stupid no one understans fully how the brain works. no one will ever understand the way I work and I wish they would all stop trying. I live my life for everyone else iu thats wrong, but I can't ever live up to any expectauions and it upsets me. I will most likely grow up to become a psyco! thats all. I'm stopping now.

__label__label0 I hate the miami dolphins and jimmy johnson, always smacking his lips. the broncos suck with out elway and not the dolphins will win. god I hate the dolphins. I miss erin so much, I hope I can stay faithful to her. everyone makes me feel stupid for staying with her when she is still in high school, but she is only 0 hours away. I can hardly wait till she comes down this weekend. I could not be more stressed, tests and other crap are bogging me down. it is so hard to make friends here that I feel comfortable around and that is only making me more nervous and stressed. I hate my rtf class, it is stupid and pointless. the reading is so painful I can barely stand to do it. dammit the dolphins scored again! I hate the dolphins! thank god almighty the cowboys won,I would have had a heart attack if they had lost, I miss my friends so much. I can hardly wait to see them in a month. there are so many damn hippies around here, sometimes they are entertaining but they are mostly just annoying. DAMN I HATE THE DOLPHINS. my phone bill is going to be huge from talking to erin, my parents are going to kill me. I feel pressured to entertain her friends this weekend and that I also stressing me out. my room needs to be cleanded badly, this place is disgusting. why can't erin just be here now, if she went here my life would be next to perfect. 
__label__label0 The computer that I am on is not very good, so oi hope that it doesn't kick me off, because it would really suck to have to do this all over again. I don't reallly understand how writing my miscellaneous thoughts will help me to learn about psychology. I do see how it can help others study my psychology, but what do my thoughts have to do with a class on introdutory psychology. This last few days I have really missed my girlfriend, seeing as how she is still at home, finishing her senior year. But thankfully I get to go home in 0 days and will hopefully get to see her for an entire saturday. I love her more and more every day which leads me to the conclusion that absence does make the heart grow fonder! I got a job as a houskeeper in the union on the weekends from three to midnight. The sorry thing is that I won't get to see any football games and also my dad is coming to visit me this weeekend, and won't get to see me untill monday because of my job. the good thing about my job is that I really won't have a chance to party. I have been sober for a year now and would lie to keep it that way, and my job will hopefully keep me away fromthe parties. I have given up drugs, cigarettes, and alchohol which leaves me with only reforming my dirty mouth. The way in which I plan to do this is by wearing a rubber band around my wrist and popping myself everytime I cuss. I also let the people around me know about this so that they can inform me of the times that I cass without my knowing it. College life has been pretty good to me so far, but my cousin is not responding nearly as well as I am. I have heard that she calls hrying everynight to her house. But I think that it is because of the fact that her parents, particularly her mother have done everything for her and always spoken for her the entirety of her life. Now that she is own her own, she doesn's know what to do with herself. I feel sorry for her sometimes, bt other times I think that it is about time she learned what life outside her family is like. I do hope that things get bette for her. and that things stay good for me 
__label__label0 Right now, I'm a little worried. I just stopped talking to my friend PROPNAME on the phone and he was talking about claiming credit and what not. I hope I'm not forgetting to do something or else I'll be in trouble. That's the last thing I need right now is trouble. My dad would kill me if I did something stupid (e. g. forgetting to do something I needed to do) and was disenrolled from any of my classes, especially ones in my major. I looked over some information I had, and I really don't think that there will be a problem, but I wish PROPNAME wouldn't have mentioned anything about it. I'd much rather be surprised than to know something was coming and have nothing to do about it. It would be like a giant meteor coming to destroy the world. I would make rather just die in a giant flash of light than have to worry for weeks knowing that there was nothing I could do to stop it from happening. In Deep Impact the president broadcasted to the world that there was an asteroid coming on a collision course with LOCNAME, I would hate that. Sure they are going to try to stop it, but I don't have that much faith in the LOCNAME Government to fix poverty let alone stop an asteroid from killing us all. Dig a giant hole in the ground. sure, that'll work. But anyway, I hope nothing bad happens to me. This whole college thing is a new experience for me, I'm not used to taking responsibility for everything like I have to now. I'm alone up here, except for my sister not that she can do anything. If I screw up it's my fault and I have to live with my mistake. And even if I do mess up, what would happen? I'd get dropped from a few classes and I'd have to wait another semester before doing the classes that I want to get done now. It might be good in a way, I'd have an incredibly easy semester and later I would have more electives in which I could take anything I want rather than having to take Chemistry or Psychology. All I can really do is hope, I guess. Other than the ocassional worrisome things, college is pretty nice. PROPNAME is an awesome dorm, much better than what I expected from a dorm. I think that I might like living here next year if I don't move off campus. I'd prefer living here actually. I never was very social before in High School, but it's nice here, it's different. Most people here aren't complete idiots. Honors dorm and all. Also people are maturing I think. There aren't as many clique-ish people here. People are more accepting of other people's views and lifestyles. It might just be that we're all in a daze from being thrown into the college and are just looking for something to hold on to, but it could be maturing. I hope it's maturing. Before in High School nobody would talk to me. I think I scared them. But here it's different. Here people don't seem to care. I think I have to give the whole "God you're so HOT lets be boyfriend girlfriend" thing a few more years, but I can live with just friends, for now. That's always bothered me though. How people, no matter how smart or mature they are, are obsessed with looks. Personally, I don't want my girlfriend/fiance/wife to be gorgeous by society's definition. I feel that every woman in one way or another is beautiful, as cheesy as that may sound. I've met people that I'd like to get to know better, and they aren't model types. I've seen those types too and they don't impress me much at all. But I think the real thing that's keeping me from getting to know any of the people I'd like to know better is my shyness. I'm not used to being social, so being thrown into a dorm with so many other social people is a strange change for me. It takes some getting used to. I need to adapt I guess, become more comfortable with my surroundings and my place in the surroundings. My friend PROPNAME became engaged too. That scares me. He's 00 I think, maybe 00, probably 00. Right now, I'm only 00 but I can not see myself getting engaged to be married in a year. 00 years, when the average lifespan of a person is over 00. That's 00 years, a long time to stay married. And if I do get married I never want to get a divorce. I'd rather spend another year making sure she's the one than finding out a year into our marriage when my wife might be with child or something else. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but I think that's the way it should be. But I can't tell Casey that. it's his life, I've seen him and PROPNAME together and they are a good couple, but people change you know. Maybe it's just my fear of the unknown or maybe it's true, but marriage ties you down, it keeps you from changing, it's binding. I'd hate to see Casey or PROPNAME's life ruined by this. Or at least I hope they don't get married until much later, and just stay engaged. Maybe I care too much and maybe it's none of my business, but this is just my stream of consciousness and it doesn't matter beyond my own mind. 
__label__label1 It is just past one a. m. and I feel like doing this now. I'm not really tired and know that I should go to bed because I have to go to class at eight tomorrow. I've done all of my homework and am extremely bored. I just got off the internet with my boyfriend back at home, which would be LOCNAME. He's lonley just like me and we have been talking for about three hours. I miss him a lot and don't quite know what to do. I really don't have a lot of friends here. I had seven best friends that I grew up with since around fourth grade and all seven of them went to ORGNAME. I really feel left out. They all e-mail me and tell me what a great time they are having and I wish I were with them. I've wanted to come here since I was in fifth grade though, so this is a dream come true for me. I just wish I had someone to talk to. They were always there for me and we always had a great time. I also miss my family, which is probably to be expected in the first weeks of college. My brother called me today, he is 00, and told me that he just got a new dwarf hamster and I know he got it just because I told him last week that they were the cutest things. He takes everything I say to heart, even if he dosen't know it. My mom's and my brother's birthday is in a week and I'm not sure if I can get home. I wasen't able to bring my car up here so I'm stuck at the mercy of my roommate. I just want to be there for their birthday's. If my roommate dosen't go home though then I'm stuck up here. I've known PROPNAME for quite a long time. For about eight years. We've never really been best friends or anything but we decided to room together because we knew we could trust each other. She is pretty neat, although she does complain a lot. I have really nothing against here though. I'm kinda hungry, if you would like to know that. Instead of eating dinner I went down the hall and watched the ORGNAME music awards and ate candy and popcorn and I'm still hungry. I don't want to have to get up in the morning. When I scheduled my classes I should not have put four classes in one day, but I had no choice. I'm really regretting it now though. Homework is hard to do if it all has to be done on the same day. I'm also taking an aerobics class and it is quite fun. I never expected it to be so physical though. I know you are supposed to exercise and all, it's just that it hurts. I am so out of shape and it just makes me aware of that fact. My eyes are getting all fuzzy. And it is very cold. I'm getting tired now and I think it is because of all the blue writing on the white background. I wasen't tired before. So, my twenty minutes is almost up and I might go to bed now. I doubt it, I am a night person. I'd rather stay up all night and sleep all day. That would be great. Well, I'll talk to you in the next writing assignment. 
__label__label1 Hi, when I think of this type of writing I think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and I thought it was very strange. right now I am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. PROPNAME PROPNAME is kind of cute and PROPNAME PROPNAME is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. My boyfriend plays football for St. marks. I love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. My friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but I can't imagine not talking to him. Last night at the Pike BBQ thing, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME played and that was cool, except that I had cramps and felt bad and PROPNAME had not called so I was mifted. I knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but I still wanted to hear from him, I am not sure that I am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. I fell like I am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so I don't know what to put. I am so tired right now. I went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (I told her to make me go)  The pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. I had issues with that; I don't think I was as openminded as I could have been because I was tired and hungry and grumpy and I had not talked to WEs this morning. My roommates phone is ringing,  I like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying,  We are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than I do. That's okay. I am not that big of a party girl and I think that my friends think I am a party pooper. Oh well, I did not party hard in high school so why start now. I know how to have fun, but I came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend PROPNAME went to ORGNAME and she has not called me or talked to me yet. I like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to I think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht PROPNAME. I am tired adn bored oh well  There are some very ood commercials on the television. I know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but I am a perfectionist. That is a major character flaw I am not that bad any more, however I am editing this little paper as I go,  I mean that I am just correcting my spelling, I wish that I knew how to type really fast,  liek super fast. wes thinks that I am Super Fine like the sugar I bought to put in my tea. Wow dallas is getting their butts kicked I normally would cuss a little in describing the cowboys, but I don;t knonw if that is appropriate for this assignment, I guess it does not matter one damn bit because it is not like anyone will read this. Anyway, Our pledge retreat was fun, okay this tyoing thing sucks. I have no idea what I am thinking. that is what I am thinking I get to go home and see wes's football game against PROPNAME. I hope that they win. okay why the hell has he not called me yet. this is very frustrating I know that he is busy but I would like to hear from him YEA only one more minute. kick ass. I love that phrase It is fun to say. My roommates phone keeps beebing and it is driving me crazy, well not really  but that was just something to type. okay time is up bu-bye  I like that way of saying bye,  The red skins just scored,  okay really bu-bye this time. 
__label__label0 clearing your mind must absolutely be the hardest thing I've ever done. To consciously try to just let your mind leak onto a computer screen is in no smallway troubling to me. I guess it should be relatively straightforward, but the entrails of my mind are hard to onterpret. In fact I wonder if the stuff I'm writing down right now is the actual true thoughts going through my conscious mind. Like right there, when I said "conscious" mind instead of just typing mind that tells me that I'm still thinking that I'm writing for something when I guess the true nature of this experiment or mind game or whatever is just to see what filth our minds gush out. in all honesty I'm not concerned with filth. I had possibly the most incredible feeling this Monday andI am still absolutely quaking from it. I had an incredible, picture vision rocket into my head about the girl I'd like to and hope to marry. Beforehand I had agonized voer her being away from me and the possibility of her blue eyes straying but I finally had the vision, and I say vision because I looked and saw her 00 years from now and I truly loved her. Then last night I had called her earlier in the evening and left a message and I thought there might be a remote chance that she would call back, and she did. That alone made my night . Then I started feeling good about myself and so I gave her a little taste of the treatment she always gives me and always succeeds in making me more eager for her-I acted like I had better things to do. So as I got off the phone adn said that I must away to bed she said, and this is the goood part, "Hey I'm not letting you go yet!" PROPNAME never in my entire existence been so happy as then. Call me pathetic, but I could watch this girl breathe as she sleeps for 00 hours a day and I would not fear etenity because that would be my perfect heaven 
__label__label1 Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in PROPNAME, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  
__label__label1 Life is ever changing. Nothing remains the same yet, you keep everything with you. Every good thing that has made you happy and every bad thing that has changed you in one-way or another. Right now I miss him. I feel love and sorrow. Lose for what we never found. Why wasn't I the one. OR instead, Am I the one who he needs?  I hate questions that keep me up at night. You tell yourself, "Go to Sleep. You have a big day ahead of you"  But does your mind pay any attention to what your body needs?  No, never. So, I find myself wondering what he is doing and what he is thinking. Is he okay?  Not caring if he is with someone else, just wishing him happiness. I hate myself for being so nice. People use me and don't even bother to thank me for that. Is that to much to ask, A simple "Thank You"?  I am greatfull for lots of things. For my mother and father and grandmother. By the way I wish she were hear. Sadness with a touch of happiness runs through my body as I think of her. As I think of when I was two years old and would help her clean the house. About all the days she made sure I went to school and did my homework. Especially of the day she left us. The day she left me. I was running. I remember I wanted her and she couldn't say anything. All I wanted was to say "Thank You" for all the love she showed me. I guess that is why I say Thank You for everything now. I should have told her that she ment everything to me. Well, I did, but I don't know if she heard me. It is because of her I am who I am today. Not only that, it is because of her that I am here. The world should be a better place. Not for anyone in particular. No, just everyone. People should be happy with who they are inside. If not, than it is difficult to reveal yourself to anyone. How many people do you know that became who they are or accomplished what they have by being true to themeselves?  I don't know many. Sure, I'm only 00, (well 00 next week) but life has not been easy to me either. When I think of my childhood I don't have fond memories. Most people I know would easily go back to the days they had no worries as children. Well, not I. I hated being a child. Even then everyone took control of me. Starting at the age of six my brother sexually abused me. Can you imagine that?  My own brother. Sure, I forgave him, but he wasn't the last. I don't remember how many people messed with me as a child, I try my best not to think of that time-period. Though I do remember that I wanted to be better a better person when I grew up. I wanted to leave and never return to the pain. Now I am strong. Stronger than what most percieve me to be. I love everyone despit the fact people are harmful. I trust everyone despite the fact people are decietful. Most importantly, I am happy. Though I do miss holding him:)

__label__label1 As I sit here and complete this assignment, I am reminded of all the other homework assignments I have been bombarded with this Labor Day weekend. Much of it is reading, and I know how important it is to keep up with it. I have learned many lessons from procrastinating. I keep thinking how this weekend is flying by too quickly. I am currently enjoying my short stay here back at home. I feel as if that in the blink of an eye, I will be back at college. When I returned home on Friday, I went to my brother's high school football game. Just being in that atmosphere brought back all the feelings of high school. Some were good and some bad, but I will always treasure the memories of going to those games and having the time of my life with my friends. My birthday is next Monday on the thirteenth, and it will definitely not be the same without all of my close high school friends. I cannot believe my birthday this year has to be on the worst day of the week. I will probably celebrate it with my family next weekend. My feet are freezing right now. I need to put some warm slippers on. Since I am writing this assignment on paper first, my hand is beginning to cramp up. However, I am beginning to think of how much I am truly enjoying this assignment. I like the way I can just freely express myself without any impediments to cease me. I feel a bit hungry because I have not eaten breakfast yet, and it is nearly lunch time. I have a familiar craving for fruit. My mom has read my mind and has just brought a bowl of grapes over to me. The taste of cold, plump, luscious grapes satisfies my momentary craving. I need to go running today because I did not eat very healthy yesterday, and I feel fat. I wonder if it has been twenty minutes yet. I think so. I better stop before I babble on forever and ever about the most randomest things. 
__label__label1 I should have done this assingment sooner. It is a different type of assignment from ones I usually get. It is hard to write out what I am thinking about. I can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe I can but I just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that I think about, especially someone I don't really know. I think that is the reason I put off this assignment for so long. I didn't know if I wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. I don't know if I thought I would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if I just wanted to keep them secret. Not that any of them would be embarrassing. I think that I mostly  just didn't want to have to write them down. It doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. I was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if I would actually get off at nine. I also thought about an internet friend from LOCNAME who I haven't talked to in a while. But I didn't think those were too interesting to write about so I began to think about other things. It is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. Just the other day, I was trying to write a philosophy paper and I thought I would be able to write it very easily. But when I actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. I knew what I wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. I became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause I couldn't expand my thoughts. I believe that I could have written a beautiful paper but at the times I sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and I couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. I htink that I have this problem often, but usually I can overcome my "writer's block" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. I think that is another reason I put this assignment off for so long. I made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have "writer's block. "  I seemed to not be thinking about anything so I couldn't just put my thoughts down. I was also worried about writing about the right things, but I realized it doesn't mater what I write about, it is just supposed to be what I am thinking. These twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and I feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. I have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that I don't have to think too much about them. I just need to write and not worry about how "stupid" I think they sound. 
__label__label0 I have a headache I took some excederine a few minutes ago I am tired. After four days off I was out of the habit of going to school. I feels good to be home. This assignment is odd. I am full. My head is hurting again with a dull pain this time. Tuesday night, nothing good comes on Tv  I have to watch satellite shows. Some people did this assignment in the first day of class. I guess it is hard to find anything to do when you move away from home  I am glad I decided to live at home, but I am afraid I am missing out on meeting new friends. Sometines I feel like an outsider on campus. But I wouldn't have made friends easily either. I would just sit around, study and be bored. I wish I was more outgoing. I want to speak to people and make new friends but it is one of the hardest things to do speaking to strangers. I want to but my own inhibition stops me. It is funny how you can want very badly to do something but someting inside you stops you from doing it  This is really helping my typing. Like in high school typing class  High school was generally a good time  I had trouble meeting people there also. I was time to graduate, more would have been ridiculus. I waited until people would make an effort to meet me rather than be proactive  I should approach people myself like I intended to do today but couldnt  LOCNAME is a big place  I have a lot of concerns  I like chemistry and welch hall but I am a business major  Business majors earn more money  I want to buy a house and a new car on my own break away rom my parents  but I am not ready to leave home. starting high school depressed me  I am afraid I will hate business  I think God's plan was for me to be a scientist but I am taking all the wrong courses  Common sense tellw me to major in business but my gut feeling is science  there are no easy answers  I can be a judge, which is cool  I don't think I think fast enough on my feet to be a lawyer  Drafting documents I can do  A masters in business would provide as many opportunities a law school But with law I get a license and a Doctors degree. Is prestige that important. Sometimes lawyers carry a stigma  I don't want to seem overeducated to work in business, but its now or never. It is too hard to decide what to do in life  I am afraid I am making all the wrong decisions. time is up I like this assigment 
__label__label0 OK so right about now I'm thinking about what a great and interesting assignment this is . I am also thinking about all the stuff covered during the last classs about the brain I can actually see my brain working, with all that left and right functioning stuff. My thoughts are now drifting a bit becasue the phone just rang but it was for my roomate. Now I'm thinking about this one girl I sat next the last couple of classes we were usually arow or two apart but man I really thinkshe is  beautiful. I hope to sit right next to her this upcoming class and start up a conversation or something. I hope she likes me, I'm nervous as all hell. Ok now I'm thinking about all the stuff I have to do today. After this assignment ill probably ask someone to do my laundry, then ill do some english and chem and of course the dreadful calculus. My sensations are somewhat jumbled I feel kinda depressed just because I have been looking for a girlfriend for so long and can't find the right one. I feel like I have so much love to give but noone to give it to. Also I really miss my friends from home in LOCNAME antonio. there are about three girls I have my eye on right about now. this one girl I went to camp texas with whose name is PROPNAME, that girl from psychology class, and this girl I have been in love with for about a year( but she is in LOCNAME LOCNAME and has a boyfriend) ,  I usually think about her every hour of th eday and dream about her like four days out of the week. Yeah I reallly miss PROPNAME a lot. sometimes I see myself kicking that boyfirens ass but then I think about how upset it would make PROPNAME. Almost everything I do is to show her that I am better thatn that loser of hers. Iv'e never met anyone remotely similar to PROPNAME, one of a kind. Oh well I got to stop thinking about it or ill end up in tears again. anyways I really can't wait till September 00 because this band that is from my home town in san LOCNAME LOCNAME is finally putting out a CD and it comes out that day. This band(Sublime) is actually old but the lead singer died in 00 of an overdose and the band members finally got over the death and decided they ow it to him to keep playing,  there motto was long live the Sublime sound. there sound is like a mix of a lot of Reagae, punk, hip hop, and some spanish stuff in there to. So since they were going to need a knwe lead singer, they got a long time friend of the band , PROPNAME PROPNAME, a tatoo artist from Southern CALI, to sing. There new name is "Long Beach Dub ALL Atars"  I could go on and on about hte history of this band and what is goung on but it would get crazy and who ever reads this would think in crazy, good thing noone is going to read it. That would kinda be crapy if anyone read this becasue they would be like reading my mind or something. I just found out I have three minutes left and I wish I could stihere and do this all day for real m like in a zone or somrething. right now I'm stumped I don't think me mind is moving at all, I'm ust thinking about hitting the right key. I feel like typing out the lyrics to the song Badfish right now becasue they are about love afor a girl and for the beach and ocean and the su, and big reefs underwater, god and all these things that ust hit me hard.    
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling very tired. I have a nervous feeling in my stomach probably because I am going to meet a guy that I've had a crush on this friday. I am kind of upset that my friend from chicago hasn't called me. I am also nervous about the semester, because I am hoping to bring up my ORGNAME since I didn't do so well, last year. My second year and already I feel like my classes  are just going to give me a lot of trouble. I'm still on basics and at times I feel dumb because I should already be in my upper division courses. I am motivated again to do well and I feel that everything I am doing so far is going to get me to where I want to be. I have exercised, studied, relaxed, etc. What else do I need to achieve my goal. I want to get into med-school and become a doctor. But, I also want to finish as soon as possible. I miss my family, but I don't miss the rules that they give me. My parents are good parents, don't get me wrong, but I still disagree with a lot of the rules. I guess everyone raises their kids differently. But in a way they have me scared. Scared, to go out to clubs with my friends, or parties or any other social activity that happens at night. Mainly because they would always tell me that it wasn't me they didn't trust it  was the "people out there"  So, that freaks me out and whenever I do go to clubs or anything I'm always paranoid that someone is going to have a gun and just start shooting. Or an even worse thought is that I might somehow get hit by a drunk driver. Whatever happens in the world that makes the news and freaks out my parents is what I'm afraid of. Maybe, that's how they wanted it. I'm still a pleasant person to hang out with, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just worry too much. Back to the feeling tired bit, well this past weekend I went home for my sisters birthday. It was a surprise. She gave me a big hug. And it made me feel really good, because me and my sister are always fighting. And going away to college has brought us closer. She is 00 and I'm 00 so it's a big age difference. Anyway I went to her party that my parents had for her and I slept about 0 hrs. the entire weekend. I got home Monday morning and slept all day. And about being nervous well, sometimes I always have that feeling. And usually I can explain it, but there are times when I don't know why. I like this guy PROPNAME from LOCNAME, the one who hasn't  called. And since I've met him, I can't seem to stop talking about him. I catch myself talking about him as though he's made a big impact on my life. And really he hasn't. So far everyone I've met has heard about him and my roommates are tired of it. But I can't help it, so lately for everyone's sake I've been keeping quiet and trying to talk about other things, but I still have him on my mind. 
__label__label0 I can't believe I'm doing this assignment should be asleep right now I wish that my roommate would quit playing his music. My other roommate is a dork he's always talking about god and crap and telling me that I shouldn't drink and this and that fuck him he's no better than me he's just as bad in other ways I really hate it when all his friends come over here it's like fucking chinatown that's what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the 00nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and that's where all the hot girls are I need to get on that floor I should have just lived in towers that would have been better. speaking of hot girls I wonder what stephanie is doing right now. I really should call her and try and hook up with her I can't tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but it's hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did I just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that I am just a perverted moron but that's not true I don't know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think I am stupid, especially when I am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and I can't believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable. I wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game I really hate my pledge brother PROPNAME that guy seems so shady if he's not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch he's acting like a fucking tool that should be PROPNAME's new nickname, tool. oh well its been 00 minutes and I am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye. 
__label__label0 well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 0, even though we came home around 000, and I had to get up at 00 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it 
__label__label1 Sometimes I think of what other people are thinking. I watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. They must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. I don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. I feel strange in the fact that I am putting my thoughts into words. Though I am concentrating on writing, I am also able to let my mind wander while I write. The way I think and the way I process my thoughts has changed since I've been in college. Leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which I desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that I have at home. My life in LOCNAME is good, but it is missing all those people that I made such a major part of my life. I wonder if those people will ever be there again. My family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. My friends and my boyfriend are the ones that I spent ever spare moment with. Now that I am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. I always travel back in time, in my head, to the days I spent with them. Every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times I had with them. Maybe they are thinking the same way. I can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. Those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. My mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but I have yet to see what she is talking about. My mother is great. Now I realize all the things she has done for me. She was always there for me, and even now that I am hundreds of miles away, she still there. I was distracted by the distant voices behind me. They seem to be discussing a project. Some kind of stress has been put on this group. I am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. Stress is one thing that I cannot deal with. When I stress I start to think a lot. When I think, I get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that I no longer can do the things I used to do in the past. Some people beside me are also using the computer. Their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that I am writing about them. If I were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. I can always feel someone looking at me. Even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes I can see someone look. Even when I don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. After this writing assignment is finished, I have to drive through LOCNAME's traffic to get home. That is the only thing I can't stand about going home. What should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. Things like that frustrate me. The light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. I have a feeling that LOCNAME is going to be just like LOCNAME, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. It is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. Pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. After that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again. 
__label__label0 well I guess I begin. anyway, I don't really have a clue as to what I'm thinking or feeling at the moment actually. I'm hoping that the psychology computer gets this even though I'm not saving it in word processor but whatever. I had a good day today well I guess. I went to mason's funeral. things just. well. I can't really place how I feel about that. well I'm upset, but can't place exactly why. but I don't feel like talking about this. I'm interested in the weirdness and indecisiveness of my mind. my husband just walked over here to check out what I'm writing. he only had to read the first few sentences to figure out exactly or should I say how inexactly my mind works. now, why does it work like that? your guess is as good as mine. but whatever. I wish I had a game of some sort. maybe just a pet to play with. I love my husband very very much anyway my friend reggie used to write sort of like this in a metaphorical way. anyway. I feel like I'm throwing off the experiment by writing stupid shit. perhaps in another place another time will unfold to a utopia that sings the praise of wrath in a time where pain is nonexistent but perhaps that makes no sense. but anyway I guess I'll keep on typing what pops into this head of mine or theirs or his or hers. from laura's box or my box. I hope lisa gets my time card I'm pretty sure I turned it in but I can never really be sure of anything. now can I? so I'll continue about the unicorns of relentlessness and the dwarfs of forgetfulness while I sing. la. la. la. but to be exact well my mind seems to be shutting down. I don't have thoughts all the time like most people. the only person I've met who doesn't either is my mom wait but maybe I have thoughts that are just on hold or don't ever quite make it to where my interpreters can interpret my interpretations of the world around me. but anyway I believe in god I believe in nothing also. but how can that be. it's a "metaphysical can of worms" that we've just opened up now isn't it no I'm not. it hasn't been twenty minutes yet yep that's right. sorry to burst your bubble but that's what I want to do anyway I happen to be learning quite a bit about myself at this point. in fact this is rather therapeutic. what would he write if he had to write for twenty minutes I think that these should be anonymously posted so that I can feel better knowing that someone is just as nutty as I am. or even that I'm not ridiculous. anyway I doesn't. blah blah so  
__label__label1 Here I am in college. It's pretty weird and scary all at the same time. PROPNAME is in LOCNAME, he says that he is in love with me now that he is away from me. I on the other hand have pulled away. He was so controlling and bad to me in high school that it is hard for me to turn away now that he is so nice and perfect. I love him very much, but I've met another guy who is so perfect in everyway. He is so nice and understanding, some much more than I've ever experienced. Mom is coming today. Yesterday was my birthday so she is coming today to take me to eat and bring me some presents. I am so tired, I was up until 0 this morning, she is going to think I'm sick. I don't know how I made it to my morning classes. On Fridays I am done by 00 am! That is so nice. I kind of miss my friends back home. It's hard to having friends that don't understand you completely yet. I love texas! 
__label__label0 so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. I wonder if I should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 0 or 0 A's. I could be one of those A's. but what if I'm one of those C's that she says are "solid writers"?? wish I was a good writer. after I read must read chemistry and psychology if I don't start soon I'll never start. and lord knows if I get behind in any of my classes, I'll never catch up again. I'm glad that I bought the notes today for chemistry. now I know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 0:00pm I can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. I'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. I've gained so much weight already. I wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. I bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. I'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. I should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes I just eat because there's nothing to do not because I'm hungry. I know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although I'm skinny, I'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. I know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says I'm everything anyone could ever want but I have so many flaws. for instance, I have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. I hate being late. that's probably why I'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks I'm a nerd but I just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. I like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. I always try to get ahead. that's why I'm always so stressed out. sometimes I wish I was not such a worry wart. I want to be laid back, really I do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. I tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should I eat for dinner. it's $0. 00 chicken wing night at pluckers. I live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but I still have left overs in the fridge so I'll save myself the 0 or 0 dollars and eat in AGAIN. I wish I was rich. I wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. I remember the day when it used to be like that. but I'm glad I ran away. I'm with PROPNAME now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 00 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 0 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. I think I'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. I guess that's it. I enjoyed this project! 
__label__label1 I can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course I let him in anyway. What is this control he has over me? I can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. All I see are blue eyes and red hair. Deep, deep blueness. There I get lost into submission. Is it me? Is it all just something I do to myself? Where are the lines I should be drawing. Why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? I wonder if he's sleeping right now? I know he's home. Maybe I should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? His room is so close just right down stairs. I know he look up at me every night through his window. He's sees everybody I let in. I'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? It will be an interesting year. I wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. Although, it's hard sometimes. Especially with the angel downstairs. Ha! no pun intended. I just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. We're so different. I'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. Maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. I think that might be part of it. I read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! He asked me when I met him if I thought we'd be dangerous together and I said, "I'm not dangerous with anybody," but I'm begging to change my mind. I wish I could see inside him. Usually I can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. I guess I'll just start looking harder. If I go down there right now I know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. I'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. Why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. Then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. Who casts the spells on us? Who laughs at our bumbling confusion? Is it all a matter of having the ideal children? Are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? If so, how does my body know? Do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs? 
__label__label1 Going off to college for me was the chance for a new beginning, a fresh start. A makeover. All the things I disliked about myself could be fixed. Or so I hoped. Unfortunately, the thing about myself that I hate the most and has plagued me for so many years has managed to follow me here as well despite my efforts to escape it and start over. PROPNAME. It hurts my relationships with others as well as myself physically. I thought that the gross puking that occurs after I eat too much would magically disappear when I became a healthy college student. But it hasn't and now my roommates are on to me. But I'm not supposed to know. Instead I just get to imagine what awful things they are thinking of me and know that every time I put food in my mouth they think I'll throw it up. And they don't even know because they haven't even asked me about it. They just speculate and have apparently come to the conclusion that I'm bulimic. Which I'm not. Yes, I have a problem that I need to take control of. But I don't appreciate the way they're going about the whole thing. My roommate, who has known me for the past three years and is aware of my condition, could actually believe them. And she didn't even ask me. Instead, she picks up the phone and calls my boyfriend. I'm going to see him tomorrow and I was so excited but now I have to deal with this. She has to go worrying him like this. But he won't worry. My loving, caring boyfriend will instead contemplate breaking up with me. He won't have anything to do with a bulimic girl  and I'm not one. I really care about him. He's my best friend. I miss him so much. I just always fear that my problems will drive him away. I wish I were more confidant and more everything. But I can't help the way I feel or the way I am. And I really need him. He makes me so much happier and healthier. But I'm not as dependent as I sound. I really had no idea how much he meant to me until I left him. And I'm always afraid that he won't feel the same. I know that we'll break up eventually, but I hope he's right about us always being friends. That is so important to me. And maybe one day we'll find out that we're meant for each other. I do believe that there is one special person that I'm supposed to marry. God has a plan for my life. But I am totally clueless as to what it is. And you know I'll never know if I don't invest any time in Him. I need to get my life in order the way I planned to the day I moved off to college. 
__label__label0 My mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking ORGNAME my roommate's mouse on her computer. It just keeps going and going and going. Then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. I have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. I hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. He died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. Now I'm thinking about lunch. which I was supposed to have an hour ago. Yet, it is very upsetting because I have no food in the dorm in which I want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. I'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit LOCNAME from LOCNAME this Friday. He'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. That will be quite exciting considering that I haven't had any great food in a long time. I'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where I moved from. This weekend I'll be going to see my parents. When I think of my parents, I get a guilty feeling because I know I haven't been very truthful to them. But, there are just things that I can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. It makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, I don't really miss them yet because I feel restricted in their presence. The sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. Maybe because I just took a shower. My body feels warm and clean. I love that feeling. The sound of food is calling. but I need to type for another 00 minutes. For some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. The thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that I have an extreme hatred for insects. The thought of them makes me itch. Now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. Writing continuously makes me tired. Speaking of sleepiness, I think of the experiment we did on Monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. I was one of the control group people who just sat there. Sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. I fell asleep soon after that. Then I woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that I left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because I had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. It wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that I drooled all over myself. Not a good image. Speaking of image, I went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. It felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. Usually I am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and "mingle," but yesterday I needed to because it was a "rush" event. I am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something I really want to do because I'm not the extremely social type. However, as for now, I will keep on rushing to see how things go. It makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because I know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. It already makes him nervous enough to know that I'm up here at the populated ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. So, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. But like everyone's advice to me: Don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. Maybe this is why they gave me the advice. Because every time I go to some party or meet new people, I feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. I suppose I get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. Now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. However, I am still determined to make this relationship work. Now I am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. One more minute to go. I see PROPNAME on my computer screen. He makes me want to do well in school. I hope I will do well this year. I feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but I suppose I'll learn to handle it. 
__label__label1 I am very excited right now, because in a couple of hours I will be on a plane to LOCNAME LOCNAME to visit my boyfriend, but I am also a little anxious because lately we have been fighting more than usual, so I am not sure what will happen this weekend. I just hope everything goes well. I just talked to my friends that live there; I am very excited to see them as well. They are planning a lot of things to do with me this weekend; it's going to be fun. I am also a little worried because I am going to miss my lasses tomorrow, but I am a good student so I hope to catch up soon. I missed classes the day before yesterday too, and I bout some gifts for my little sisters. I miss them a lot. I have five siblings, one brother who is the eldest, and 0 sisters, one older than myself, the other three younger. My older sister and I both study at LOCNAME, my brother studies law in LOCNAME, where my family lives. This is my third semester here. The first that semester I was here, I was very sad and depressed. I missed all my family very much, and felt so alone, because my sister had her own friends and I knew no body in this city, but then I got used to it, and now I love PROPNAME, I couldn't wait to get back from my summer vacation, even though I had a wonderful time in LOCNAME. I worked this summer in the finance department of the LOCNAME LOCNAME, and it was great. I also took a correspondence course from ORGNAME and did very well on it. But the best part of the summer was definitely going out with my friends. I went out almost every night, it was the best. I am not really sure what I was supposed to do with this paper, or if it's going to be right, I am just righting everything that I can think of. I really like this class. I have so much fun in it; the professor makes the class interesting and fun, something very hard to do with such a large class. I usually try to avoid large classes as much as possible, but I am glad that I got a chance to be in this one. Well, time is about up. I am a really slow typist, because I only type with one finger, so this might seem shorter than the other. I really have to start typing like a normal person with two hands, but what can I do, right? Well, I'm going to return to my packing, I've got to get up early tomorrow. See you next class. 
__label__label0 I get sick to my stomach during your class and not because I dislike you. I think there are too many people in one room for my personal tastesI start to feel claustrophobic. However, it's fun to people watch with such a large "sample. " There is a 0D icon on my computer and it reminds me that I like graphic design. I feel like a fool writing this. I've started a majority of the sentences with "I"a bad habit. I also don't know whether I'm not even supposed to write in complete sentences. This is what I'm thinking right now, though. Is this because I'm typing at a computer or because I think in sentences? Maybe I think in sentences, but it seems like it would be a waste of time. Surely it's easier to label things as I would see them and without pronouns, verbs, etc. There are green and red squiggly lines correcting my grammar and spelling at the top of this paper. Think I should correct that? I'm not expecting a response by the way. I realize that any answer you may have I would receive far too late to correct any errors I might have. My first class of everyday is Latin. I only thought of this because I don't like/am not very good at foreign language and have a lot of homework to complete by tomorrow morning. Another squiggly green line. Damn. Oops, another. Perhaps you're wondering about the origins of my surname. Well, I'll tell you. My great grandparents (on my Dad's side) came here from LOCNAME. Our name was PROPNAME. At LOCNAME LOCNAME they chopped it down to PROPNAME. My great, great, grandfather was a Lithuanian Rabbi who killed himself by trying to lift a cow over a fence. I get a laugh out of that. I never met my mom's dad. Actually, not even my dad met him. He died in his forties from cancer. Pancreatic I believe. My other grandpa died when I was 0 and a half. Interestingly enough, he "retired from life. " A week before he passed he took my father aside, his other son he was much closer to, and told my dad that he was ready to go. My dad got mad, "What are you saying? You have two new grandkids, there's lots to see. " LOCNAME , etc. He insisted he was ready and my dad was pissed off at him. Didn't speak to him the next week. His brother, my uncle, was in LOCNAME LOCNAME when he died. As much as it makes me angry, that's one of my favorite stories. My grandpa has always had a mythical aura around him and that tidbit only lends validity to it. I just found out a few months ago that he had another daughter with someone other than my grandma. My grandma knew, but didn't mindit was before they got married. My grandma also is dead and my dad and uncle knew very few details about it. When I got back from LOCNAME LOCNAME I was told of the newsI looked through my Grandpa's old wallet, something that apparently everyone else forgot to do. There were only a few pictures in there. My grandma, my uncle, my dad, and this little girl with a blue dress. My grandma told my dad that Grandpa gave a blue dress to her on her 0th birthday. Speaking of favorite stories, I got a job back home at a video store. I worked there because I was enamored with the manager; she's only a few years older. But she's great, hilarious, beautiful, everything and there's no one who doesn't like her. Before she opened the store one day she was in the local Fry's supermarket and this older lady came up to her and said, "You are beautiful. " PROPNAME, the manager, said, "thank you" and went on her way. Then she realized the lady didn't have to do that and that was a very nice thing to do. So she went over to the florist, bought a bunch of flowers, found the lady, and gave them to her. The lady thought it was so nice that she invited her to dinner that night. I think that's a beautiful story. 
__label__label0 Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. 
__label__label1 For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 0 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, "I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, "Why are you here at LOCNAME?" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, "I don't know" or "That's a good question. " So with that said, I ask myself, "Why am I here?" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? PROPNAME PROPNAME is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 00 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being "brainwashed" in college. So what exactly does "brainwashed" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, "When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. " NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to "use" my degree when I "get a job. " I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. 
__label__label1 Today I had my third day of classes at ORGNAME. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to ORGNAME so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in LOCNAME, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. 
__label__label1 I am really tired right now. Yesterday, PROPNAME (my roommate) and I went at 00:00 at night to PROPNAME PROPNAME to lift. I really have to use the restroom right now, so I will be right back. Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 0. 0 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. LOCNAME vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 000 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 000 people in it, and that is 00 more people than in my graduating class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME last May. Well, it has been 00 minutes. Bye!  
__label__label0 This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm "like the nicest person I've ever met!". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. PROPNAME hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like PROPNAME a lot too. He's so strong and "Mr. Cool" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe PROPNAME got up to almost 000 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the ORGNAME party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope PROPNAME is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish PROPNAME was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 00 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while PROPNAME was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but PROPNAME plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later. 
__label__label0 I am extremely tired having recently returned from classes. The bus ride wasn't as cramped as usual but just as long because of the heat, and because I had nothing to look at or it'd seem very much like I was staring at someone. Not that it really matters though, but either way, I prefer looking at the 'view. ' Anyways, I'm not much in the writing mood right now. I'm so used to just rambling on like in my journal entries only I tend to forget almost that I'm turning this in. Well, actually, I haven't forgotten that because I am not getting personal with this. Which reminds me, I haven't written anything in a while. I mean, anything all together, not just journal entries and such. Did I ever tell you how I started writing in a journal? First, let me note that I call it a journal, not a diary because it sounds much too feminine and prissy. A silly thought, I know, but that just shows how immature I was when I first started. That also reflects another aspect of the way my family is, but I won't go there. It's too complicated and no one will ever be able to figure it out. Really, my family and I are all about each other. People who know any or all of us may find that odd especially if they aren't so content with their family or at least at the moment. But, like I said, completely different, controversial, complex topic. I'll just end up talking myself in circles again. But like I was saying, my first journal was from Mrs. PROPNAME, my seventh grade English teacher who I used to help sometimes in the mornings when we actually got to school early enough for me to have time to assist her. I was her teacher aide, which was something that junior honor society students got to do. It (the honor society and everything else involved with junior high) really is petty, among other generally negative things. Well, let me type faster so that I can finish this lame, boring story. Well, at the end of the year, as is customary, we exchanged presents once again. I of course was broke as usual so I think I ended up giving her some flowers that I got from my aunt's wedding the weekend before. Hey, I think I did that with my secret teacher too. Yup. Anyways, she (Mrs. PROPNAME) gave me a journal because of the one almost actual conversation that we had (I wasn't very good at being social then, if you can't tell). We had talked about writing and I mentioned how I thought that it would be awesome to actually write a book someday, something great that I can sit back and just stare at knowing that I put all those words together, I wrote all of that. I don't know, I like to see good effects of hard labor. You know, the finished product. I guess that's why I enjoy writing, drawing, coloring, making things, and putting things together. Oh, and reading too of course. Anyways, back to my story again. Well, I also mentioned how I thought it was neat how one of my friends, PROPNAME PROPNAME, who had just moved to this school from the northeast, had written a sort of book that told you how to draw horses. The plan was that she would write and draw the pictures and another girl whom she later became better friends with in high school, PROPNAME PROPNAME, would type it and get paid for that. Well, Mrs. PROPNAME gave me the journal at our last morning together and told me that this could be my start. In fact, she wrote inside something cliche like, "just think, one of these days when you write your book, I can say that you used to be my student. " Except, it didn't sound so cliche as that when I read the inscription. She also said how she had always regretted not keeping a journal especially now. Then, I was just happy that I received a present, a pretty yellow one with stripes on it. Yes, I was a very selfish and greedy person. Needless to say, I did start writing in that journal. In fact, my journal collection has grown to about four or five maybe. I'm really not sure. I stopped writing for a long time then I started again. I've been too busy and lazy to write lately, which always makes me feel guilty for some reason. I guess I am really grateful to her for that first journal though. I wonder if either of us realizes what kind of a difference that has made for me, especially during the hard times I guess. Time is up now. I'll write more later. Bye bye. 
__label__label1 Today has been a pretty good day, I guess. It's Thurs. , so it's closer to the weekend, which always makes life feel better, for one reason or another. I've had a lot of homework, and I know that the fun is only just beginning. I hope that somehow I will be able to keep a healthy balance between social life and school life. So far, I honestly think I've been spending more time studying and reading for class than doing anything else. My dorm floor seems kind of rowdy at times. I just wonder how all these people can just go out and hang around and do all this stuff all the time. Don't they have homework, too? I wish that I was just really really really smart so that I wouldn't have to work so hard to understand things, especially things that seem relatively simple to many other people. I went to the SI group for Psychology today, and I really liked it, although we didn't cover much class material, considering it was our first SI meeting. However, I like the small atmosphere, and I like PROPNAME. I think that if I have any questions, it will be easy to have them answered then. I'm starting to worry about not making new friends and stuff. I guess it will all work out in time and I'm just feeling insecure for no reason. I would like to have someone to go to the game with Sat. (today is Thurs. , Sept. 0), but my closest friend here has to work, and I haven't met anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to go together. Oh well, that will all work out, too, I suppose. I kind of like this writing thing, because it's like writing in a journal, and I think it's healthy to write about feelings and such. Sometimes I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing with my life in general. I'm undeclared in school, and I have no real idea of what I should do with my life in the future. Certainly one day I will recognize that I have a specific purpose to serve. I would like to figure that out, soon, though. Tonight I'm going to ORGNAME with my roommate. We grew up together. I really like mocha and caramel frappacinos. It's really interesting to me how popular coffee drinks are now. We had a discussion about this in my sociology class. It's such a trend right now. I'm starting to get tired of writing, now. I have that irritable feeling where it's just almost miserable to sit here and do this. Well, it's really not that bad, actually, I just want to get this over with. check it off my list of things to do. My family misses me! They're very proud that I'm here, though. I hope that I can continue to make them proud. I guess that all depends on the tests. I don't even know what to expect. I just pray that I won't do that terribly bad. I'm definitely going to do my best. Okay, six more minutes. Do you know how long six minutes is when you're sleeping and about to get up? I cherish those last few minutes in bed, really I do. My mom called me this morning about forty minutes before my alarm went off. That was annoying, but luckily, I had no problem falling asleep again. I can't believe some people that have worked at the University get paid only $00,000 a year in some cases. That's incredible. I'm not sure a strike is appropriate, because students are paying money to be taught, but still I was shocked to hear that from Prof PROPNAME. Girls keep screaming down the hall and I feel like I'm nine years old at summer camp. That's weird. I've been thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. I'm thinking that it would be easier to study if I lived off campus, but easier to get involved by living on. Maybe next year I'll try getting an apartment and see how that goes. Well, my time is almost up. Bye. 
__label__label1 Today has been one of the longest days of my life. I have had only one class today so I am constantly looking for some way to spend my time. It seems that everyone I know here on campus is in class or at work, therefore I am left alone with nothing to do. When I sit there with nothing to do I become very homesick. If it were not for my Friday classes I would be long gone. It excites me however, that tomorrow I get to go home. I can't wait to be in my own house without a roommate or doors slamming through the night. One thing that I can't wait to see is my cousins. They are adorable. The oldest, LOCNAME, is like the sister I never had despite the fact that she is only nine years old. I enjoy being around her ORGNAME it makes me proud when she comes to me to ask personal questions. I have three other cousins too. PROPNAME, who is five, is so cute and has such a wild imagination. It excites me to watch her imagination at work. She is one of the very few children left in this world that can entertain herself for hours with a paper towel roll. Next is Will, the little man. He is only two and is constantly making me laugh. He is in love with ORGNAME ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. He knows every word to the songs and has his own little dance for each of them too. The youngest, and I have to say my favorite, is little Miss PROPNAME PROPNAME. She turned one on August 00. The reason that I think I like her the most or think about her the most is the fact that we almost lost her. She was born with the strep virus in her lungs and spent the first month of her life in the ICU on a lung machine. She is now a healthy little girl. She is now walking but it seems so weird to see her walk because she is only the size of a 0 month old. She is so tiny. I can't wait to see them. They are the world to me and I love them and miss them everyday. Just as I do my parents and my brother. That is on thing that gets me down about college. I don't like being away from my family. I love them dearly. They mean everything to me. Writing this paper has depressed me but I know that tomorrow I will get to see them all and spend the entire weekend with them. Yeah! My brother is cool. I am one of the very few girls in this world that got blessed with an awesome older brother. He is three years older than me and he has always been there for me, much like my two loving parents. I thank God everyday for the family that he has given me and the support he has surrounded me with. 
__label__label0 I wonder if PROPNAME will like the game. It is a shooter type game and does have a fun factor that is pretty high but will it last us until Playstation 0. PROPNAME. I want to see her again. Hopefully a couple of weeks from now. I am starting at 0:00 so 0:00 is when I will be finished. This wristband is the most stupid idea and it sucks that I can't take it off. I have to get up really early on Thursday to get my tickets to the game. PROPNAME and I will go to Target well maybe not. We will look at the magazine for a while or on the internet and see if we can find some games. Why the hell did I turn the fan on it is so cold. I don't know what to do for dinner maybe I will read before hand so that we can watch Highlander. I should ask Grace if she wants to eat with us. Damn only 0 minutes have gone by. That whistling noise needs to be fixed but I guess I'm already used to it. PROPNAME I must call Mike about the DBZ movies. Maybe when I have some money duh. Why the hell did I bring that statuette. I could easily fit it in with my stuff. I want to be laying next to PROPNAME and want her to be with me all the time. This cell phone thing is going to be expensive. Good the light is still flashing. Man its really hard mapping your own thoughts. Once I find a thought to write about my mind concentrates upon writing it down instead of just free thinking. Carpet is nice. It would suck not to have it the room would be colder than it already is. I probably need to wash my clothes soon I am running out in my drawers. Why is my keyboard making this strange thumping sound when I hit the space bar. It never did that before. Maybe because I am alone and there is no other. What's up PROPNAME. Amar just came in. Someone standing behind you is really annoying. Ha ha. Jeff will be back at five. We need a new game. Sleeping with my girlfriend was great. Damn my morals! Windows sucks my ass. Sit down and play some games. 0:00 sweet! Yes my air vent is really annoying. Pool would be cool. Yah I played pool in a while. Not really that good. You have your own stick bastard. I didn't know you have to have your own here that sucks. Come back soon. Oh well at least he is nice. I so badly want to have sex with PROPNAME but my religion and morals, life tells me not too. It would ruin both our lives. We could do it protected but there is too much risk. The amount of pleasure is not as great as the amount of possible pain, suffering, and problems we could incur. Yes its 0:00 I am done. Out. 
__label__label0 I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of PROPNAME PROPNAME at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 000 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 0 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when PROPNAME makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. LOCNAME is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. 
__label__label1 I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in LOCNAME when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope PROPNAME made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time PROPNAME's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to LOCNAME this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in LOCNAME. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to PROPNAME's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad PROPNAME doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 00 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 0:00. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 0:00 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought PROPNAME was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have. 
__label__label1 I hate you. I hate how you have the power to hurt me. I hate how I called you wanting to merely tell you about "our" song being on tv and I got shot down. I hate how you called me some other girl's name thinking it was her that called. I hate how you can call some other girl and start to like her so soon after we broke up. You said that you had feelings for me merely 0 days ago and how can you forget about me so quickly? Was I just not that special to you that you could forget about me so soon? I hate you for not wanting to have a long distance relationship with me even though you're only like 0 hours away. I hate you for making me hurt so badly inside. I hate you for making me feel that horrible feeling you get in your chest when someone just breaks up with you. I hate you for having the power to invoke such emotion within me. I thought that you were different. I thought that you of all people wouldn't hurt me. You always told me to give you the benefit of the doubt and I finally learned to do that. You always said how you never wanted to hurt me and you never did until last night. Nothing you ever did was as painful as that. I just felt like someone had stabbed me and run over me a few times. I care so much about you still and I just don't understand you. You told me that you didn't want to have a girlfriend this first year at school, but then why in the hell are you calling a girl to get something started with her? How could you lie to me when I asked you who she was? You of all people never lied to me and never hurt me, but last night you ruined everything that I had made you out to be. I had you on a pedestal from all the other guys that I've been with and you proved me wrong. I wish you could feel all the hurt that I feel right now. I wish you could hurt so much that you don't know what to do about it. I wish you could take this hurt away from me because I don't deserve to feel this way. All I ever did was care about you and be good to you. I'm not sorry I still have feelings for you because you were just that special to me that it will take me awhile to get over you. I could never call some other guy and start talking to him so soon. It's so early and not fair to the other person. It took you forever to ask me out because you wanted to make sure you were over PROPNAME but what about PROPNAME? How can you talk to her so soon if I know you still have feelings for me? Am I just that easy to get over? I thought I was so much more than that. I'm not stupid, PROPNAME. I know you all too well. I know when you lie to me, but I guess I didn't know you too well because I never thought you could hurt me. I never thought you could be with another girl so soon after me. You told me not to start something with another guy to fill that void of you. Is that what you're doing because that's not fair. I just can't believe you. I wish there was something you could do to make me feel better, but I don't think there is. I don't even know how we can be friends anymore. I can't trust you even as a friend. I now know that you can lie to me. I wish it wasn't like this between you and me. I wish we could be together because things were so great with you that I didn't want to let it go. You were the best boyfriend I ever had but I don't know about that anymore. You ruined that whole perfect picture for me. I hate you for making me feel such sadness. How can you do that? 
__label__label0 At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, LOCNAME, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows? School is stressful for me. There is so much studying to do and I feel like I have no time to do it. There is time though but I don't like to be alone. And to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. I guess I just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. Hopefully all will work out best. 
__label__label0 How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average PROPNAME. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the "s" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 00 minutes. 
__label__label0 Sometimes I think that maybe I need to make some changes to my life. Almost everyone I meet in my life think I'm too shy or too quiet. Personally I think I just don't like to talk. I tend to stand aside and listen or observe what is being discussed. Sometimes those who don't know me well get the wrong idea that I don't like talking to them. A lot of my good friends from high school think that I've changed since I came to college. They say I've learned to open up more to people. I think I'm still the same person though. I guess when a person moves into a college environment it's kind of hard not to talk to people. I mean we're always meeting so many people everyday. I guess another thing I feel like I need to change is my stress level. I tend to stress out very easily. Anything from school problems to things happening at home could make me nervous. I always feel so tense. It's as if everything is going by so fast and I don't have enough time to complete everything I need to do at once. When I'm around my family I usually try not to show them how stressed I am. However when I'm with my friends it's pretty obvious if I'm stressed out. I become moody easily and don't have an appetite. The last two years of college were stressful for me. I didn't know what I wanted to do in my life. I felt that everyone around me had a plan or goal they were working towards. For me, I couldn't find what I really liked. I tried talking to different people but it never really helped. Actually the main problem was myself. I'm always so indecisive. If someone was to ask me to choose between two things, I wouldn't know which one to choose from because I felt both were equally good or bad. 
__label__label0 Is ORGNAME ORGNAME for me? Should I have stayed with my friends in LOCNAME? I thought I was going to meet to meet a lot of new people here. I don't know what to do? Why am I here? I don't even know what I want to be. Is college even for me? I hate that song. I think I could be happy with a low paying job. I don't know. People here are different; maybe it's just me. College is supposed to be the best time. I over think everything. I should just go with the flow. Everyone tells me you will love it here once I meet a few people, but it seems unlikely. I have met a lot of new cool people, but I can't see them being as close as my friends back home. Even the girls here act differently. I have meet a lot of new girls, but it wasn't what I expected. It seems like I'm the only one who feels this way. I know I over think everything. Maybe I'm not giving U. T. a chance. I think I'm trying, but I feel awkward here. I worry way too much. I don't know why I always think about this. That music is loud. I hate complaining like this, its useless, but it's all I think about. Who knows maybe I'll meet new people when I go to I. S. A. tonight. But I know it's going to be like everything else, you might meet new people but you will never see them again or get to know them. I'm so glad I am going home this weekend. What will I do? 
__label__label1 Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to inform you of my recent achievements, thoughts, feelings, and general relevancy of life. I have been under some stress for the last few months due to recurring repercussions of the recent divorce of my parents. I am and have always been one who stands and is ready to be strong for others, but some time it takes more strength to cry. I am glad that my involvement in dancing had led me to this time so near my departure for the Olympics. This had helped to separate me from the hectic antics of family. Although it has given to great an amount of time to reflect upon my inefficiencies. Again as I type I am thinking I am wondering as if this incoherent gibberish will be or can plausibly be translated into recognizable human thought and used in my aid. This in itself has become a major threshold of relief for me. Confrontation of my fears has always been a struggle. Fears a plague of man for centuries, we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being. See, as I continue I have diverged farther and continued in my pursuit of happiness and my race against fear. I fear that I am losing control. Not of myself but of family. They stray farther and farther from the objective, but seem to relentlessly ignore the many warnings and offers of aid from their peers. Is it true that we are not safe from torment even without villain, or can it be that the most prevalent villain be he who lives within us. Tearing at each muscle and heartstring, pulling our every emotion straight from the gates of happiness to the pits of despair. I've dug myself into this hole and finally confessed, but the only my own strength can bring me out. Ironic isn't it. I am not nearly psycho or even remotely suicidal, but life can bring one down. A carefree person is at the greatest risk, because it is with that lack of care that you neglect to watch for the advance of the ranks of despair. I have yet to find the reason or meaning behind any so feelings. Let alone answer any thoughts or feelings of my own, but simple writing forms a haven, safe place, or a virtual escape from the locks of my own mind. Only as I overcome the fallacies that I have founded my realities upon, may I escape the shackles of my own torment. I really have no problems, other than an overly kind heart and mind that troubles me more than worth. How can I escape my own shackles when it is by the same power that I am confined that I am held captive. My thoughts are low and stamina lost but open freely now are the gates of hope. Once again proving that the pen is far mightier than the sword. 
__label__label1 Well, I hope I'm doing this assignment correctly. I think it might be too easy and that's why I'm having a problem with it! Well my eyelids are very heavy. I'm very sleepy. It's cold in here but I don't feel like getting up and getting a blanket. I really need to do my Chemistry homework also. I'm trying not to procrastinate too much. I'm really bad about that. So I'm attempting to get off on the right foot. I'm bored. I'm looking around the room at my beautiful orange pipe that they installed last week. Just the thought of it makes me angry. I hate typing sometimes because I always hit the wrong keys. Next week is going to be busy. I have to pick E and PROPNAME up form the airport at 0:00 and I get out of my last class at 0:00. As soon as I get back to campus I have to go to a meeting. I hope I'm not late. I don't want to walk in late! I really hate typing! My feet are very cold, I need to get some socks, but I'm not sure if we are supposed to stop. My fingers are cold too. It would probably help if I dried my hair. At least that's what my mom always says. I really need to fix my computer wires. They are a mess! They should put a hole in the back of the desk so the wires can be in the back, but NO that would make too much sense. It has to be difficult! Well I've almost been writing for 00 minutes. Yeah, tem more left! My neck itches. My eyes are getting droopy. That dream I had last night was really good. I don't remember what it was about, but it was good! I wonder why I can never remember my dreams? Maybe I'm just weird. Who knows?. My feet are very cold. I have to get up and get some socks. Ok I'm back. I'm really excited about going to the Matchbox Twenty concert next week. That's another reason I wanted to get this assignment over with. Ooh, I've got six minutes left, I've got six minutes left! Yippee. I guess that's how you spell that. Well my spell checker didn't catch it. So I guess I'm right. I'm not a very good speller, but that's OK. I really want to take a nap this afternoon. I think I'm going to. I'm glad PROPNAME's not here. I have the room to myself! That put a smile on my face! I love Cheerios. They are one of my favorite cereals! Ooh, my hair is falling in my face. I hate when it does that. I don't understand why its so cold in here. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. I'm excited about going to the game. My hands are cold. I really need to organize my stuff in my room. I'm so glad maintenance fixed my bed! Now I won't fall out in the middle of the night! That makes me happy! I'm sleepy. Maybe it will help if I open the blinds. That blind man in the cafeteria was nice. I wonder what he was doing there. Well my time is up. Ooh, I even went over by a couple of minutes! 
__label__label1 What should I write about?. Anything that pops into my head? Okay. Well, I have to write PROPNAME email and via snail mail. I told him I'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was one fun and exciting weekend. I miss him so much. I think of him as much as I do about PROPNAME. But PROPNAME more so, of course. I can't wait to see PROPNAME again. Mom's cooking really smells good. She's cooking Filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. The watercolor picture on the front cover of the PSYCHO text is quite unusual. Looks like one of PROPNAME's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. Hmmmm. how much more time do I have? Eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. I keep thinking about ORGNAME and the internet. I have to catch up with my email writing and AFLS posts. I rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. There are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. PROPNAME posts there, though. That's really nice of her. Very thoughtful lady. But what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. They probably know more about PROPNAME than they do about themselves. They're so obsessed. I just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but I'm not that type of person. I like writing this way. It's like a diary or a journal of some sort. I should do this more often. It's quite relaxing. I used to keep a diary. I'd tell it everything, especially how I felt about PROPNAME when I was younger. about 00 or 00 years old or so. I had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. He liked me, too, big time. It was only a few weeks ago, when I saw him after 00 years that I confessed. We were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. It felt so natural  he said so himself. I could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. And we shared so many common interests that I never knew we had before. My, what a story we have. It's like a long lost love affair. This writing assignment is pretty neato. Just writing down thoughts. Putting it into words. I could write a whole novel. HAHA! I'm still thinking of PROPNAME. But, alas, I am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. I didn't really know him back when I was 00 years old. His family, yes, but not him. It's only during high school that I got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. It wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in PROPNAME's case. I eventually fell for PROPNAME and I will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as I shall live. Should I end here? I've got one more minute. Well, it's at least 00 minutes, but I feel like writing more. My mom's cooking smells great. Well, time's up but I'll keep on writing. I need to go to the bathroom, too. So, until next time. This is confidential right? Now, where's that submit button? 
__label__label1 Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Crystal, and I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and PROPNAME got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about PROPNAME and I talked to PROPNAME about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to PROPNAME about Buck. PROPNAME is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. PROPNAME and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in LOCNAME. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $0/hr. That should be 00 times more, but I only work 0 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in LOCNAME. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. PROPNAME, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 00 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. 
__label__label0 As I gaze at the screen I sit and wonder what is the meaning of friendship. This is my main thought at the moment. I've had rough relationships with friends. To me friends are the kindness that everyone needs. They are around when nothing seems right. They continually partake in your days' events. Friends give comfort that no other can give. No matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. Therefore a friend is always ready to lend a "helping hand". I guess friendship is a bond between two souls. A friendship is a promise to be "there" whenever possible and an understanding of one's feelings. A friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. In a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. The greater is the heart. For a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. Anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend. A friend has no materialistic need and can only be repaid with the same truth that is given to you. Friendship is a privilege and a great responsibility. As I write about friendship I think of my friends. One friend comes to mind. She is such a wonderful person. I love her because she accepts me for the way I am. For half my life I've learned to be scared but with her I know that it's okay to open up. So many things run through my mind that I don't even understand them. Thoughts of hate and confusion run about my mind all the time. It sometimes seems as if time just passes by and I can't stop to take a breath. People around me seem to talk but nothing is seen or heard from me. Sometimes I feel like all I do is live in other people's shadows. I feel that I wake up and I am really nobody. 
__label__label1 This is a very interesting time right now. Right now, I have so many different feelings inside me right now. This is a new part of my life, yet it does not feel all that different. I guess it's because there are so many familiar faces here and I'm still pretty close to home. I'm kind of glad about that, it makes me feel much more secure. I really want to take full advantage of my college life. I want to meet people, I want to have fun, I want to experience everything, and I want to do all that and keep myself on track. I signed up for a ballet II class and a street jazz class over at the union the other day. I figured that while I did not want to get heads over heels into dance again, I definitely didn't want to give it up because I still love it, so this was great for me because it will be a casual class and it's basically right across the street from me. I also signed up for an informal ice skating class. Figure skating was such a big part of me, but when I got too busy with LOCNAME, I had to stop, so I figured that now was the perfect time to start again. I knew it would be a beginner class, but I figured that it'd be good to work on basics. I took the bus there, got there late, and they were doing twofoot glides. No offense, but it truly was a beginner class. Afterwards, PROPNAME (the teacher) saw me jumping and spinning on my own, so she's putting me in the more advanced class after the beginner class, which was really cool. I also met these two girls, PROPNAME and PROPNAME, who were also in my class. They were so nice, they got off the ice before I did, but they actually waited until I got off and then they told me that they could bring me to and from the rink from now on so I wouldn't have to ride the bus, which I thought was just so incredibly nice of them. PROPNAME brought me home, and PROPNAME gave me her number so that I can call her next week and she can bring me there. I was very happy last night because 0) I restarted a hobby that I truly have a passion for, and 0) I met new people and I feel like I am starting to create a new world for myself. Seriously, that is one of the reasons that I loved figure skating so much, not just that I love the sport and that I love gliding across the ice and flying in the air to music, but because when I was skating, I was in my own world. It was like my safety, my refuge. So I am feeling very good that I am beginning to regain that. You don't realize how much you miss something until you actually do it again. I've been pretty happy with everything for the most part. It's been a nice and rather smooth transition, because it didn't feel like I was making too big of a transition. The main difference to me is that I don't have to worry about being home by a certain time to avoid making my parents mad. I don't have to worry about making my mom mad (because she takes everything so personally) and all that sort of stuff. I've been thinking about PROPNAME every now and then. Just passing thoughts about him, wondering what he's up to, if he thinks about me, that sort of stuff. It's not like I spend all of my time thinking about him, but he passes my thoughts very often. I guess he'll always mean a lot to me. It's funny, because I've been so happy with everything lately, but today, I am feeling particularly angry with PROPNAME. Just how judgmental she is upon me and how overly selfrighteous she is. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that (being selfrighteous), but with her, it is to a fault. It's to a point where she's hurt me and insulted me and angered me. And she claims to be watching out for me because she cares, but that's not what I call leaving me to find my own ride. She's let me down in a big way and she has no right to treat me like that. I'm not normally an angry person, but I am really upset with her right now! I really just don't want to talk to her for a while. Going back to LOCNAME this weekend was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed seeing everybody again, although it was only for a little bit. One thing I like about having high school people here at LOCNAME is that even if I wasn't friends with them back in LOCNAME, it's kind of like, now that we're at college, we have some sort of bond because we're from the same place, so we become friends, which is really cool. Anyhow, my twenty minutes are up, so I'll talk later! That's basically me for right now (or all that I can think of and remember right now anyways)! 
__label__label1 As I sit in this room, in this computer lab, I hear all the different sounds around me. The computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. I also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as I type. I've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. My eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, I would love to take a nap. This day was pretty long. I hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. I'm feeling so tired! I would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. I don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. I know when I go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but I ate way too much today and I am not in the least bit hungry. Not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. I wish I was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. I hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. It would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. Seeing him makes me miss him more but I guess I should enjoy our time together. I wish he went to this school or at least lived in LOCNAME then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. He seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. I don't believe him when he says that. I wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. I am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. I hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? I wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. I think I'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because I'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. I do love him though. It'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. Tonight is Thursday night. This is a good night because I have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. I should have done this assignment earlier but of course I always wait for the last minute. But technically this isn't the last minute because its not Friday yet, and it is early evening. Tonight I want to do nothing but relax! I hope I can get together with my friends since I don't see much of them anymore. I wish I lived at Jester at times like this. I thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. I have this sweatshirt on but I don't feel like taking it off. How many more minutes until my time is up? I've typed quite a bit of information thus far. Pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. I wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that I type fast and I can type basically every thing that I am thinking. This computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. I hear music and I'm wondering where it is coming from. I figure since tonight is the Mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. They should have a Honduran culture night. Haha. Why is the computer across from me making so much noise? Wow. I sure do ask my self a lot of questions. Well, I think my time is almost up. I guess I have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. I am so terrible at mental math. What happened? I have 0 minutes left I guess. How terrible I am at mental math! I am glad that I don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. My grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and I've been too lazy to go to the office hours. But I did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. Why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. I walked all that way to Jester for nothing. I'm sure if I got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. Why am I assuming that I will get a bad grade? Maybe I won't. The TA seems pretty easy going and she knows that I am interested in keeping/getting a good grade for that class. I. am glad the movie station is back on. I'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. Sleep. I want to sleep! I wish I wasn't always so tired. Yes! I only have a few more minutes left. I'd say about 0 minutes left. Finally! This is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in Times new roman font. I didn't know I had that much stuff running through my head. Actually, it doesn't surprise me. I always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and I can't think straight. I think that's why I interrupt people so much when I'm talking. because I have so much stuff in my mind that if I don't say it I'll forget it. I guess that shouldn't matter since I'll have another 00 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. But anyways. My time is up. How great! 
__label__label1 I cannot believe that I have only been back home for a couple of days and already I want to go back to UT. I guess in a weird way I consider UT my home now. It is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. I am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. I see things differently now than I used to and am starting to wonder if I even want what I used to. I want to go into journalism, but ever since I got to UT everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. I am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that I would love even more? I am only eighteen, I could not possible know right now what I want to do with the rest of my life. I have a good idea, but I cannot know for sure. Yet everyone expects me to know what I want. I do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. Personally, I just love the process of learning interesting things. I have been waiting forever to go to college just so I could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. Every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. In my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. It was a typical high school. Academics were mediocre, but football was God. The athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. Athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. Some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. In a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. I do not really think I learned much in high school. I learned more in three weeks in LOCNAME than I did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. I had all these romantics notions of LOCNAME and LOCNAME, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. I really want to go back there sometime. LOCNAME was so gorgeous, and I thought I would hate it. In the end, it was one of the best places we visited. Most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but I think it prepared me a lot for college. I had to interact with a lot of people that I did not know really well. I also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the Jester Dorms. Who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! It is kind of weird being in a dorm. Instead of having to drive to see my friends, I could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. We are practically living together. I just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. It just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. We either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. Unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. Two of my good friends are coming to school here. It really is a good thing too because I am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. I can talk and talk once you get me going, but I'm not really good at those first meetings. Things always seem too awkward to me. Then I just feel uncomfortable. I think that is why I usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. It is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. In time though, I should be able to relax and deal with all these things. I hope, anyway. 
__label__label1 Um. well I don't know where to start. This is extremely weird and I feel like I am just going to start rambling on and on. I think I'm thinking too hard for this little assignment and it's driving me crazy I guess I'll just go off on tangents and type away. I am so bored out of my mind and everyone around me right now is talking about being hungry and going to get something to eat. I shouldn't have eaten that can of soup and should have waited and gone some place good wit my friends. What am I thinking what am I thinking about. This is so much harder than I though. I thought things were just going to flow and I'm sure that they usually do but since I'm concentrating so much things are flowing like they usually do. I'm so stressed out right now. For some reason I feel like I have a world of things to do, do I? Well I know that when I think to hard about all the things I have to do it seems like I'm never going to finish doing what I have to do. In the long run though things seem to work and yeah I'm not going to freak out. I think right now I'm going to go back to my apartment and plan out exactly what I have to do for the rest of the day then get a pen and just scratch out as I go along. I know that I'll fall asleep though. I've been so lazy lately. I think I should start running to get my blood flowing but I know myself and it'll never last. Well who knows we'll see what happens, I could just go home and clean the apartment that would be a good work out. I think I'm thinking too much about unimportant things I guess who cares I'm just going to do whatever I want to do as things come to my mind and I'm not going to force myself into jogging around and sweating then never wanted to run again. Holy cow! This is not fun at all I'm running out of thoughts and this is just becoming words jumbled on to a paper. I wonder if I'm suppose to have paragraphs and stuff oh well too bad. Is this suppose to be something important or say something about myself. If it wasn't for having to type this my day would be complete I could take a nice long nap without having to worry about getting this out on time! Ugh! Okay I wish I could just live in LOCNAME and not go to school. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight? Nothing is fun anymore it's always all the same stuff. Um well jayne and them are coming in from LOCNAME LOCNAME so we'll see what happens. This movie is so cheap I laugh at the stupid parts even though they make no sense what so ever. What a mess what a mess. Ugh I need to clean up my home today so bad I don't want to! I clean up and two seconds later it's a mess all over again. Okay well I'm thinking my time should be up. Is it up yet. Yes two minutes and them I'm done. I'm starving all of a sudden. I'm so frustrated with this whole thinking process It's just a mess I hope we don't have to do this all the time. I think I'm going to be disappointed when I read back on this. I'm going to see that not one productive thought runs through my mind in 00 minutes. That is so pathetic. I wonder what would happen if I didn't have to do this and I started jotting down my thoughts. Okay time is up. 
__label__label0 I'm supposed to write for twenty minutes. So I think that I will write about what I know the most about. I know the most about myself. Maybe this means I'm stuck up  because I'm writing about myself and not about something important, like homelessness or starvation and poverty and other things of that nature. But if that is the case, I will just have to be stuck up. I don't know that I really understand myself, so I'm not really sure what I should say. Sometimes, I'm fairly predictable. Other times, I just don't know why I do what I do. I guess everyone could say that about themselves, so I'm not being too original here. I'll try to think of something more original. I am weird. I wonder if everyone thinks that they are weird. I am not comfortable with love, yet I crave it. I close the door in love's face when it comes knocking. I like movie love. The kind where everything just ends happily ever after. PROPNAME is a perfect example. She finds the man of every woman's dreams, and gets him. I think I once found the man of my dreams. But I just wasn't ready to find him then. At least that will be my excuse for letting him get away. I wonder why people think that love is so important to find. I feel like it is the purpose of our being here. Do animals really search for the ONE? Or do they just find a new partner every season? Maybe that is what is supposed to set humans aside from animals. Everyone thinks that humans are so much smarter than animals. I think that maybe animals are much smarter. They don't mess with love. They just have mates. I bet their lives are less stressful. I guess love really isn't that stressful, as long as both people are in love. It seems to me that when you are in love, everything seems perfect. Life suddenly loses its stressfulness. I think the phrase is that it looks like you're looking at the world through rosetinted glass. Roses are nice. I love flowers in general. They smell good. They look pretty. They are such pointless gifts because they die so quickly once they are cut. But I guess that is what makes them so nice to receive  the simple fact that someone spent money on something that will only last a few days just to brighten your face for a moment. 
__label__label1 This is beyond weird! I never thought that college could be so exciting and scary at the same time. It is so weird how my thoughts have progressed through these two weeks of college. I never thought that things would be this independent. I am finally away from my mother and father who always told me what to do since I was a tiny little ballerina princess. No more telling me what to do or when to get back. And yet the weirdest thing about all this is the fact that I feel no urge to go out and party on sixth street. I guess all that time my parents were telling me what to do and when, was all taken into consideration when I moved up here. In changing the subject, I just came down with a throat infection and it is the worst ever. I told my parents that I had to get my tonsils taken out a long time ago but they never listened to me. It is not fair. I had the worst night's sleep last night and to top it all off, I have to catch up on all my class readings which means no catching up on sleep. I am such an observer when it comes to just walking down the street or on my way to classes. It is so funny how people I know act in a bizarre way around others compared to how they act in front of me. The other day I caught myself looking at a little boy no older than seven years old, and he caught my eye because he was on top of his dad's shoulders doing the "hook 'em horns" sign with his tiny little fingers. It was the cutest thing because it reminded me of when I used to get on top of my father's shoulders and do the exact same thing. In a blink of an eye though, it all seems but a distant memory. It is so weird how I always dreamed of going off away from my LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME life and coming to live my life far away from all the kind of people I could not stand. Do not get me wrong, I loved my family and "real" friends, but there was just something about that town and how everything ran on the game of politics. It was all about what kind of car you drove, where your family came from, how they were connected to some of the richest people in town, and so on. It all meant nothing to me in the end because the way I saw it was soon I was getting out of there with some place to go where people did not care about things like that. I accomplished everything I wanted in high school. The highlights were getting head drum major two years in a row and winning homecoming queen and getting to conduct in my white gown in front of my band, my family, and in front of everyone in LOCNAME! It was an awesome day. The best days were when we would attempt to study for an extremely hard economics test by going over to someone's house and actually doing no studying at all. Those were the best because even though we saw each other in class, it was just on a 'hi' and 'bye' basis. When we got together, we would get each other caught up on the latest gossip and laugh about the stupidest things all the way into the night. Somehow, we all managed to pass the test the next day and we all felt better knowing that we had connected the previous night. Talking about people in our school was the main thing because our school was made up of all kinds of want tobe's, gangsters, stupid people who actually fooled everyone into thinking they were smart, and so on. Unless you were in band or on a varsity team, the people you hung out with were not at all your friends. It was the best feeling knowing that so many friends were there at band practice everyday and tennis as well. I would have to say the only thing really excellent about my old school were the faculty. My band directors were my closest friends and still are to this day as well as my tennis coaches. They always went above and beyond the call of duty to try and help with whatever I needed. Now that I am gone, I guess it is time for them to help raise another bunch of good students and friends. I feel really good leaving that small town, not knowing what to expect out here in LOCNAME. My morals and ideas my parents, friends, and teachers taught me through the years will always remain a part of me no matter where I go! 
__label__label1 I am in a hurry right now. I have a retreat to go to in 00 minutes, which is at the end of this writing. I feel very rushed and very sweaty. Personally, I don't like long term assignments. I usually end up doing things at the last minute (like now) usually do to forgetfulness on my part. That's one of those college things that I have to adjust to. Other things I have to adjust to are the food, independency, new friends, new people, different people, persecution, etc. , etc. However, I really like this place because of the above reasons. For a majority of my life, I've been mostly independent, living in a singleparent family with one younger sibling. My mom took care of me and my brother, but she would always work. I didn't have much of a father figure growing up either. My parents got divorced, and my dad moved to LOCNAME and got remarried. I stayed with my brother and my mom in LOCNAME. During those times, I grew and learned a lot about life, by myself. That was the catch. Everyone learns about life, the right things, the wrong things, in some way or form, usually from their parents. However, since my mom always worked, and I didn't have a father figure, I learned about life by myself. I made mistakes, I made several wrong decisions, and I did things that I regret. However, I also learned a wealth of knowledge that I feel others my age do not possess. I was ahead of the peers around me, in life and in experiences. My independency started at an early age, one could say. I learned to take care of my brother, as well as other everyday tasks. Do you know how many people on this campus don't know how to do their laundry?! It's insanely too many. For many students, their parents have pampered them and done their laundry for them for their whole lives. And then they come to a university where they have to do it by themselves and have no clue what detergent to use, how much, how to separate clothes, or even what fabric softener is. In the past 0 weeks, I've done my laundry twice now in the dorms. I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and since their is construction going on, our laundry hours are from 0pm to 0am. These hours suck because from 0 to about midnight, there are people crowding the place. Also, I'm usually out during those times, at the gym, arcade, eating, whatnot. So, the last two times I've done laundry, it's been at 0am in the morning. The washing cycles takes 00 min while the drying takes 00 min, totaling to about an hour and half, given loading and transferring time. The first time I did it, my roommate was with me. We stuck our clothes in at 0am, and came back at 0 to stick it in the dryer. But at 0:00am, we realized that our laundry was still down there. However, we were still in our room playing video games. We ran down there and found that the door was locked. Our clothes were stuck in the laundry room for the rest of the day. We wouldn't be allowed in until 0pm that day. This was especially bad for me because I had practically run out of pants. However, I seemed to have made it through. So, the second time I did laundry, I did it myself. Again, it was at 0:00 in the morning when I stuck it in. This time, however, I made sure that I wouldn't get locked out. So during washing and drying, I slept on the ground by the laundry room door. My drying actually didn't finish until about 0:00am. To my dismay, they did not lock the door this time at 0. I was very frustrated and tired; but glad I had clean clothes. Anyway, I miss my family. I really don't want to live with them again. I just want to see them and talk to them more than I already do. My mom calls me everyday. I think it's annoying, but I'm sad because I think it's annoying. My younger brother is getting involved with some bad friends and school, and our mutual friends tell me about it, but I can't do anything. I'm also sad because of that. There are more reasons I'm sad. The drawing for tickets for the LOCNAME vs. OU game went on yesterday(Thursday). Each student had to get a wristband with a certain number on it (mine was 00000). It was given out at random. They started the drawing on Thursday with number 00000. By 00000, tickets were already sold out. Guess I won't be going to the game. That really stinks. It's ok though it would've cost me $00. I'd rather go to free games anyway. I think my 00 minutes are about up now. Again, I am still in a hurry to leave, since my ride for the retreat will be leaving soon. Goodnight. sort of good afternoon. 
__label__label1 My goodness. I have so much to do over the next few daysnot to mention the next semester. Wow, my first semester in college. I love this freedom. I want to go to sleep. I feel like I'm completely wasting the time and the freedom I have by sleeping through it all. My roommate is at a LOCNAME LOCNAME function right now. I'm in the sorority. I really should be there. I guess I'm a party pooper. She pissed me off a few hours ago. I really liked her, but I'm beginning to get some weird vibes from her. Someone was caught smoking weed on our floor in our dorm tonight, and the resident assistant went to talk to him about it. My roommate got really mad about it. She said, "That's so dumb. That's why those people wanted to live off campus. The RA said he was going to be lenient on that kind of thing, and now he's getting them in trouble just because someone ratted them out. " Oh well. oh God. I have to go deal with some feminine hygiene issues. Okay, I'm back. Anyway. I don't care where you live. That's still completely illegal, and people shouldn't be doing that. She was just so blasé about it. I don't drink, and I don't exactly condone that either, but smoking pot is so much worse. If people are going to do illegal things, then that really sucks. But if they're not hurting anyone besides themselves, then whatever. If that's the case, then let them do their own thing. But they absolutely do not have the right to feel victimized if they get caught. That's so immature and irresponsible. I'm listening to ORGNAME by ORGNAME right now. Wait. I have to check the spelling on "Pachelbel. " Yay. I was right. I figured I would be. not to sound cocky or anything. I just like when things are spelled correctly. oh. I have to press "repeat. " I really like this song a lot. I'm getting more and more into this classical music thing. My parents, or my mom really. my dad's not really concerned with me very much. my mom raised me to be pretty cultured. I love music and the arts. So anyway. I love this song. The string quartet played it as the wedding march at my mom and my stepdad's wedding when I was only eight years old. I was the maid of honor. Goofy. This song reminds me of one of the instrumental pieces from the little mermaid. the part in the movie where Prince PROPNAME is escorting the human PROPNAME around his town. The instrumental piece is playing when they are dancing in a little square and he lifts her up just as the music climaxes. Oh. it's so beautiful. That part always gives me the chills. That sounds so dorky. I think it's just the combination of the beautiful music and the thought that PROPNAME and PROPNAME are falling in love. Hold on. got to press "repeat" again. Sometimes this laptop really makes me mad and frustrated. The keys are so small and close together that I press the wrong one a lot. It's really annoying. I miss LOCNAME. I used to live there. I feel sick. I'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. He was smoking earlier, and I was in the same room. On top of that, I've had a cold for the past four days. I'm all stuffed up, and I have to blow my nose again. I switched to another classical cd. I especially like some of the pieces on this cd. Right now, PROPNAME's (yes, I did look at the cd to see how to spell that) "Piano Concerto in B flat minor" is playing. I really wish I knew what "in B flat minor" means. Ok. my "stream of consciousness" was interrupted. I feel really bad. My hallmate called me and I've been down in her room for the past 00 minutes. Oh. I just walked back into the room and "The Waltz of the Flowers" from the Nutcracker is playing on my "000 Masterpieces of Classical Music" cd. This is such an amazing song. I miss taking ballet classes. I really need to get back into it. I'm so out of shape. I have this yucky flab on my thighs. And I really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. I'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that I've been doing for the past three years. It's all for show. I want to go back to taking classes where I can dance for the sake of dancing, where I can appreciate the beauty of it, where I can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. I guess I'm weird. I just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music or when I'm dancing. I just have these moments where I get PROPNAME and I'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. I really miss LOCNAME a lot. And I'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. My throat hurts. I just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell "throat. " That kind of thing really scares me. I mean. We're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. I really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. It just really pisses me off. That's so analretentive of me, but it just really makes me mad. Okay. I have to do my homework for my linguistics class now. I must say that I had a really interesting time typing this assignment. I've never done anything like this before. I think it has convinced me that I need to start keeping a journal of my thoughts. 
__label__label1 Isn't it amazing how lifting weights can make you so aware of your muscles? Every last inch of me is sore. I am such a weenie. Exercising is fun though. It helps me relieve stress. I'm already starting to feel a little stressed here. I wonder if I am an abnormally stressed person. What is a normal stress level? I'm having a hard time deciding which organizations to be in. I want to be in communication organizations to help me be prepared for my career but I also want to be involved in a Christian organization. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME sounds neat but it takes up a lot of time. I wish I were better at knowing what God wants me to do. I want to follow Him and to be patient but I also don't want to not be assertive and let opportunities slid past me. I feel like much of my life I have been too laid back, letting things come to me. I'm tired of being out to lunch. I want to prove to my dad and my brother that I can be responsible and detail minded. I want so badly to get a 0. 0 this semester. I feel so torn. Part of me says drive hard! Study hard! Don't let organizations take time away from academics! Prove you are worthy! But I know that I need to follow God and the He is what gives me value. I am probably making too big of a deal out of all of this. I think I'm just frustrated with mistakes I've made in the past. I need to let those go and not worry about what my dad and brother think. I know my dad has faith in me deep down. I just feel sad and I don't really know why. I just wish I had more direction but even as I type that I know I just need to listen to God. I guess that's the problem  I'm mad that I don't get a clear answer from God. It's so hard. I've never been totally sure of what God wanted for me. Well maybe that's not true, but I never hear his voice telling me what to do. I wasn't even sure if coming to LOCNAME was what He wanted. I saw lots of doors open up for ORGNAME and when I was expecting to see bad things about UT I found that it really wasn't that bad and the students were really friendly. Now I'm trying to figure out what decision to make about organizations and I'm secondguessing every phone call from members in the organizations and the gut feelings I have when I go to the meetings. I don't feel any strong direction and I'm mad, frustrated. There must be something I'm doing wrong. I want to be closer to God but every time I try I end up getting so confused and frustrated with Him and myself. Why does being on the verge of tears for a long time make you have a headache? Man I hate how my desk is set up. Gosh, I'm being so negative. I really hope my paper is the one out of 000 that y'all decide to read. This really isn't representative of what I am like. Tonight is just a bad night. God has given me so much yet I worry about so much. Like my business and professional speaking class. I don't like the idea of being graded on my performance. I know I won't make eye contact and make all sorts of other mistakes and get a bad grade. Wow! Listen to me. I'm going to be one of the people they call to do a study of depressed people with low selfesteem. I put on that questionnaire that I am generally happy and have a high selfesteem but that was last week. Tonight for the first time since moving down here I feel sad. I was so proud of myself for not freaking out and adjusting well. Maybe God is trying to show me that I really can't do this on my own. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here thinking that it's rather nice that the Ethernet in my dorm is finally up, although I feel bad that my roommate is still having problems with her computer. She has an ORGNAME Aptiva and it seems that the wireless Ethernet card just doesn't agree with her system. I staring at my philosophy book in front of me, and I think that drug legalization is an interesting subject. I've never considered drug legalization before. I always thought that drugs were bad and that was the final end to the case. However, all these philosophers (who aren't all that old and ancient) think that legalizing drugs might be a good idea. Not that they want to promote drug use and make it easy to obtain for everyone, but legalized in a restricted fashion like cigarettes and alcohol. I also need to write some letters to my friends and stuff back home after this assignment since I haven't talked to them in such a long time. I can't decide which sort of stationary to use since I collect stationary and stickers, so there is a wide variety to choose from. I miss them greatly since I don't have as many friends in LOCNAME as I do back in LOCNAME. I haven't been here long enough. There are my roommates, though. As a matter of fact, I'm curious about whom my roommate is calling right now since he seems like a close friend. She's talking about food since she didn't get any before she came back, and that makes my stomach respond slightly. I only had 0 slices of pizza for dinner, and that apparently isn't enough since my stomach rumbled when my roommate mentioned food. She also asked me if a friend of ours was 00 or not, but I don't know. He's a nice guy since he helped me with my phone jack. I couldn't plug in my phone since the jack had been painted over to the point where the wires can't even register each other. I think I'm running out of things to say since I can't imagine what else might be of interest to occupy my mind. I've nothing to look forward to this evening except reading assignments from all of my classes. I realize that reading is essential to the learning process, but all these long chapters are tedious. There isn't too much of great interest in reading these heavy textbooks. I wish we had textbooks like they do in LOCNAME. Their textbooks are really small and light so they don't get backaches and have to lug around huge backpacks. Perhaps people in LOCNAME will slowly grow shorter since the weight of backpacks stunts the growth of young people in this country while LOCNAMEese children grow taller with the freedom of light backpacks. It would also be nice if international music from LOCNAME and other countries would be more accessible here. It's hard to find Japanese popular music in LOCNAME. You have to either order them off the Internet, or look for the small stores that specialize in importing these types of CDs. It is rather expensive, too, but it is kind of ironic that Japanese CDs also cost about $00 in American dollars in Japan. CDs are cheapest in LOCNAME since they only cost about $0$00american dollars there. It would be nice if I could visit LOCNAME often, but I don't have the time and plane tickets cost more money than I have to spend on leisure travel in a year. I think that is a pity since I would like to see my uncle and my grandmother more often. And the fruits in LOCNAME are of a much greater variety and sweetness. The same type of fruit here is much smaller in size and a great deal more expensive. They don't taste the same either. I think my dad misses LOCNAME the most, although he has made many friends in LOCNAME. I miss having Chinese food every night, too. It feels weird not using chopsticks for two weeks in a row. I have to remember to bring some the next time I went back to LOCNAME. I really miss my dad's cooking. He cooks really well. And he knows where all the good Chinese restaurants are. It's hard for me to order food myself since I don't know the names of the dishes. The names I do know are in Chinese, so sometimes I pronounce them wrong and the waitress gives me this funny look. I think the food I like best at this particular time is Vietnamese noodles, dim sum, and this chicken steak with rice. I think I can get Vietnamese noodles here, but dim sum is something best eaten in a big city because it's a specialty that only some cooks can get right. I am not sure about the last one since I am unfamiliar with the Chinese restaurants around campus. It is something I may do during the weekend, exploring the nearby food places to see what is good to eat around here. I really talk about food a lot when I'm hungry, it seems. There isn't much in my room's refrigerator since I haven't gotten anything as of late, and it would be rude to eat everything that my roommates bought. I shall have to go to the store in the morning or after school to obtain some snacks for when I am hungry like I am now. The cafeteria here closes at 0 PM so I can't do anything about being hungry at the moment. I have a screen mate program that creates little lambs to wander around my computer screen. There are five of them wandering around right now, and one of them just sneezed. I think it is funny since I just sneezed recently. These lambs are very adorable, and they don't take up much computer space. They sleep and jump around, basically entertaining me while I'm doing my homework or just when I'm surfing around the Internet. I love being connected to the Internet at all times since all of my classes post important information on the web, and because I like to do personal research of my own into the subjects and hobbies I cultivate. It is also good for multiplayer games, but there seems to be a firewall in my dorm network that prevents me from hosting such games. It aggravates me greatly, but at least I can participate with a steady connection unlike when I used to use ORGNAME. 
__label__label1 Right now I'm listening to PROPNAME. The band not the person. It can be really confusing talking about all the PROPNAMEes that I know. There's the band, which happens to be from LOCNAME and is really awesome. Then there is PROPNAME who goes to school here. There is PROPNAME who goes to ORGNAME and who I dated at the beginning of the summer. I really liked him. It's too bad that didn't work out. Then there is PROPNAME who goes to ORGNAME and who I really like a whole lot. I've liked him for almost two years now. We just really connect and get along. It's crazy when you meet someone you just work with. I have met a few people like that, and I'm not just talking about boys, but all relationships. I always feel lucky when I know someone who is like me, who I can just hang out with and be boring with and just have so much fun. My mom and I are like that too. I miss her so much. She is my best friend. I know some people say that, and it just becomes another petty phrase, but when I say it, I mean it with all of my heart. She is the most awesome person I have ever met. I want to be just like her. That is my goal, my stretch, the place I know I can never reach, but my dream. She is my stars. I would be so happy even to be half as great as she is. She is a teacher, but not only in the sense that she works at a school and teaches her students French. It is one of her innate gifts. She is a teacher and a nurturer. When you let her be those two things, awesome things happen. Now that I let her be those things in my life, we have the most fulfilling relationship one could ever ask for. All I have to do is hear her voice and I am practically in tears. It's crazy how much I miss her. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. I just want to be with her all of the time. It's crazy how this is my mother and I feel so close to her. I'm not supposed to be in that place for at least a few more years. I guess I am just incredibly lucky. My family is the most important thing in my life. I figure it will take time until I get used to being away from them. I don't think anyone would ever peg me as the homesick type. I would have never pegged myself as the homesick type. I had no clue I would take it this hard. That's a surprise. I guess it's such a shock because two years ago first of all I was not so close to them, and I was a major stoic. No feeling. And now I am not afraid to admit that I love my family and miss them. I think that I am going to go home this weekend. I wasn't planning on it, but I don't want to stay away from them that much longer and there's no reason I have to since I do live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. It's not like it's a terrible trip. My father makes it every day. I don't know if I'm going to though. I really don't want to ride home between two huge men in my dad's carpool again, and I don't have my car yet so I don't know. I'm still listening to my Travis CD and really enjoying. It's on the last song, which lasts almost 00 minutes and is like 0 songs in one. It is really great. Sometime I have to listen to the words though, because I really have no idea what it is about. Now I'm back to being excited about seeing the band. It's in less than two weeks, and Travis from ORGNAME is coming down to see them with me. That is going to be so awesome. I really want to go home but the whole carpool thing really bugs me. Maybe I should call my dad and tell him that. Just tell him that I don't want to ride home with his carpool because that is a terrible experience. Maybe he would be able to work something out for me. Well, the CD stopped, and twenty minutes has elapsed, so those are my cues to stop writing. I'm going to go make my decision now. 
__label__label1 Last night around 00pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. She told me that a guy I went to high school with had just committed suicide on Friday. Apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which I had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. No one knew where he was so they went looking for him. They found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). It still hasn't hit me yet. I have been at school with him since the first grade. I know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. After last year I thought everything was going to be better. At the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) PROPNAME committed suicide by hanging himself. After getting over that, PROPNAME was killed in a car accident. After coping with PROPNAME's death, I thought nothing else was going to happen. I mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. The rest of my year was going great until April. That was when I found out that one of the girls who I had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. She overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. I couldn't believe it. For years I would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. Going to her funeral was the hardest thing that I have EVER had to do. I cried the minute I got there and didn't stop crying until days later. Seeing her parents made it even harder. I mean what can you say to them. Nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. Nothing could make you feel any better either. She had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. I absolutely and completely fell apart. I couldn't see where I was going I was crying so hard. Even now as I am writing this assignment I'm getting tearyeyed. I still don't understand (and I probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. I mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. PROPNAME is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary/junior high school. Everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. Now I'm just wondering if the saying will come true. Will there be a third suicide or death that I'll have to deal with? I really and truly hope so. I sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. When I first started this assignment I didn't think that I'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. This is kind of therapeutic though. I'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so I've decided to start typing about something better. I really excited to be here at the university. I really love it here. My classes and professors are great. I am worried/anxious about final exams though, but I still have awhile before those come around. I'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. Unlike in elementary through high school in which every 0 weeks you got a progress report and then every 0 weeks came your report card. I'm also getting used to being alone a lot. Sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. But then again you meet so many new people. Well, my time's up. 
__label__label0 Right now I am a little worried that I am not doing this right because I don't really know what I am suppose to be writing about. Well, I am excited because my best friend, PROPNAME, is going to be in LOCNAME in about two hours. She started school in LOCNAME about two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since then. We are going to the lake tomorrow and Labor Day and I can't wait. I love going to the lake with PROPNAME because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. I am excited about school starting. I have always planned on coming to LOCNAME, but I never thought the day would ever actually come. All my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. I think that I will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester I am going to have to take a nursing 000 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that I have to give. I hate giving speeches. I always think that I'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech I start to shake and sweat. I am getting better at it though. I believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. My freshman year in high school I was terrified of getting up in front of the class. I would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what I was saying. It was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. During my junior year I was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior I played at region band and almost made district. I also performed skits and memorized a Shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. I am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that I don't know very well. It's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that I know well or my family and friends. I just feel like people that I don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. Now I just try to forget about that and try to focus on what I have to say. As a nurse I will have to deal with people a lot. I enjoy talking to people one on one, but I will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so I will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. I hope that by the time I graduate college I will have no problem speaking in front of people and that I might even enjoy it. 
__label__label1 How do we know that everyone is seeing the same color. We all call colors by the same name because we are taught that as children, but do we all see the same thing? When I look at something that is red I know what I am seeing, but I have no idea what someone else is seeing. They could be seeing what I know as the color brown. I am sure that there is some piece of scientific equipment that could prove this theory wrong, but it is still an interesting concept to me. Seeing something through someone else's eyes is impossible. I have no idea how others see the world. If the color theory were right seeing something through someone else's eyes would give an entirely new aspect of things. Red trees, orange apples, the LOCNAME flag would be completely different. It is easy to say, no that's a stupid idea, but if you really think about it it is fascinating. People always use the argument that we call colors by the same name. "What color is that? Well, its brown. Well I see brown too so your theory is wrong. Not so fast. When we were learning the color names as children we all learned the same names. When someone held up a card and said, red, that is the name that you gave that color in your mind. There is no proof that everyone saw the same color. I do not think that this is actually the way that things happened, but it is interesting nonetheless. I would like to know how this theory could be proven wrong. Just like I would like to know how they can prove that certain animals are colorblind. They cannot see through that animal's eyes, how do they know what it sees. Some animals certainly are colorblind, like the deer. You can wear bright orange when you hunt deer and they do not notice, so they are obviously colorblind. Who is the first person that figured that out? They were either really stupid or really smart. I would never think about wearing bright orange to hunt an animal. I'm sure that's not the only test there is to see if an animal is colorblind. There has to be a scientific way to prove it. My 00 minutes is just about up and I have run out of things to say. This is kind of a weird assignment. It will be interesting to see what kind of application this has. I actually enjoyed writing this paper. It is a lot easier to write when there are no set guidelines. 
__label__label1 I am here, miles and miles away from where I started. things are progressing slowly but I can see what I want now. yes for a moment it seems oh so clear and then it fades. it does not matter what I do with my life only that I am alive. anything besides being alive is what the time was like before I was born nothing. I do not fear this nothing however I just know it will be at the end of all my experiences. so I better make these experiences count. there is no resting no relaxing when there are times to be had. I again get distracted though. this body I inhabit continually calls upon me to fulfill its need. if it is not this it is that. but it is the only place my mind has to stay. sure it is a great tool beautiful in a way but I feel the drive to leave it behind. I spend many passages of time trying to discover what feeds the burning inside of me, what will motivate me to take a task to a great level. I want to design I want to build I want to create. a need is present to put something not just something but something carefully crafted out there for others to take in and make it part of their entities. I alone have fed off what others before me have so delicately created and taken it in through my eyes and ears and other senses. all those creations have helped craft the person that I am. so I know it is time to project all this back outwards with a spin that is all my own. and when I do this I must not think about it I must subconsciously perform using the feeling that lay inside me. I have found a companion. we have discovered that when we combine our idea our thought our joy our pain it becomes a thing of greater nature. we are translating our combined impulses into a media, a media that will allow this combination of raw human toil to be available for others if they so choose to spend the time taking it in and seeing if it is a part of them as well. 
__label__label1 Right now at this moment I am feeling a little anxiety. I tell myself that this is normal, being a first year student I should feel this way. But the thought does not comfort me. For some reason I feel I am the only one who is going through this right now. I don't feel anxiety all the time though, when I run into friends or go to class it all disappears. My only explanation is that I am comfortable with routine. I hate routine. There is nothing exciting about it, it's just boring. There's no risk in routine or adventure, only security. Maybe that's why I feel so much better when I have work to do or a class to catch. I hope I grow out of this and become more relaxed. The way I see it is that the only way I'm ever going to grow out of this is to get use to the different lifestyle by gaining confidence over time. You can only gain courage towards something as you do it. All I have to do is get over that first hurdle, just do it and not think about the situation for too long. That's my problem; I worry about the future way too much. Worrying is a waste of time and I know that from experience. Half the things I have worried about here at school have turned out to be nothing. But for some reason I still worry, I worry a lot. I have noticed that nothing ever turns out the way you plan in your head. So if I plan on worrying, why do I actually worry? I know there's a good chance it won't happen because I thought of it. I will never enjoy life like this. If this keeps up I'm going to have a problem. I want to go out into the world and totally change something. But I know for sure that won't happen if I don't grow up!. 
__label__label1      Urg! There is sand in my sandal. It's been there for a while now.  It was so annoying that I had to take my shoes off while I was driving   home from my horrendously long art class today. I had to wait for   half an hour for that stupid bus. It was at least 0:00 by the time I   reached my stop. You'd think that rush hour would be over by then. It   wasn't. I sat in traffic from LOCNAME all the way out past the Y at 000.  That is just insane. I was stuck behind a maroon jeep cherokee with   a Gore/Liberman bumpersticker on it for most of the way. But that   guy exited when I got to the 000/Mopac split. Then I was confused as   a white Rav 0 started diving through lanes into spaces too absurd to   drive in. It was quite odd and annoying all at the same time. Then I   was almost cut off by a stupid woman in a red mini-van and her   punk looking son. I'll just say this: I was ready for this day to end at   about 0:00 this afternoon.  Now it's getting cold in here. My dad's office is always cold. Of   course, his computer is always on. It's a giant that's hardly ever   used. Shame really. So my feet are starting to get quite chilly. More   of the usual discomfort.   The smell in here is rather interesting. It smells like candy. Cherry   candy to be precise. For a moment I thought my boyfriend might be   eating some of the lollypops my dad always has on his desk. He   wasn't though. Odd. It's really not that usual for an automotive shop   office to be smelling like candy.  There are too many boxes at my feet. It's hard to get comfortable with   all of them at my feet. I keep mentioning my feet. Why is that? They're   uncomfortable, that could be one reason. I feel bad because I have been sort of brusque with my boyfriend.  Here he is, come all the way from across town just to see me and I   can't even spare him five minutes before I launch into my homework.  I think I'll give him a hug now. Just a minute. I think he appreciated   that. It was a necessary break in my stream of consciousness. He   gives so much of his time to me, the least I can do is give him some   back in return. Sometimes I wonder why he is so loyal. I tend to rush past him   when I'm doing something or I overlook him when he wants my   attention. He really dosen't deserve that. He's such a nice person. I   always tell him that I'm a mean person and that he would be better   off with someone prettier and nicer. He just smiles and hugs me   and tells me there is no one better. I have my doubts, but I really   don't think I'd give him up if someone better were to come along. I'd   fight to the death to keep him. That's how much I love him. I'm a very jealous person. I'm stingy with my boyfriend and I'm stingy   with my friends. I don't like anyone being around him (mostly   females) if I'm not there too. I know I shouldn't be so difficult, but it's   not really something I have any conscious control over. I don't like   my sister being around my friends either. I hate sharing friends with   her. She's younger than I am and she has her own friends to hang   out with. I don't bother her friends, why should she bother mine?  I'm beginning to wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over for   me to wash it. I've been needing to do laundry for a while now.  There's charcoal stains all over my shorts, and I've run out of spiffy t-  shirts to wear, so it's off to the wash. I don't know whether or not I'll   have time to do it all tomorrow as I had hoped. I also need to pay a   visit to my old high school tomorrow. I've promised my friend PROPNAME I   would visit. There's really only three teachers I want to see: Mr. PROPNAME   (physics), Mrs. PROPNAME (English, Creative Writing), and Mr. PROPNAME   (Newspaper). The trinity of great teachers. And with all great figures   there has to be a   devil  . Mine is Mr. PROPNAME, my art teacher for three   years. I looked up to him as a mentor and he turned his back on me   at the end of my senior year. I was crushed. Still I wonder if my   boyfriend brought his laundry over.  He's really not the most hygenic person in the whole world. I've had   friends tell me that he's lucky to have me because he's too   disgusting to date other women. I don't have a problem with him.  Sure he tends to go three or four days between showering, three or   four weeks between laundry cleanings, and three of four months   between room organizing, but I love him anyways. And besides, I've   been know to go a day or two or three between showers. All this   talking about him makes me want to hug him again. I think I will.  Once again, just a moment. okay, I'm done.  I keep hearing the sound of a little red desiel ORGNAME outside. There   are no windows in here, so I really can't see. Very strange indeed. My hands are starting to cramp. My wrists are aching and my   fingertips are numb. It's a leathal combination of the extremely   powerful air conditioner and all this typing. My hands are starting to   look cold too. When my hands are cold they get a little paler. Even a   little yellow. Did I mention that my neck hurts too? It does. My butt is   doing nicely, though. Must be this comfy chair. My dad bought it at   the ORGNAME ORGNAME  for his birthday. It's really nice.  Sometimes I wonder if I have a brain tumor. There are times when I   forget simple things, or I get simple things confused. I really hope I   don't have one. I'm planning to spend the rest of my life with my   boyfriend. I suppose I should really call him my fiancee. Yes, that   works. We're going to be married on February 0, 0000. It's going to   be marvelous. We're going to have platinum puzzle rings made for   our wedding bands. Why puzzle rings? Because we exchanged our   own special puzzle rings as marks of our engagements. I don't   know if I would call it official or not. We haven't formally announced it   to our parents. Mine already know I'm not leaving him. I half think my   mother wishes I would. My dad likes him, though. That's always a   good sign. There is a gigantic printer seated on the desk beside me. It's a   monstrous beast of a machine. It's actually a printer, fax, copier,   scanner all in one. Great piece of machinery, really.  I don't want to do the dishes that are waiting down at the house. I   had a long day filled with the joys of muenstral cramps, and I'm   really not up to the task. I hope someone does them before I finish   all this. I have five younger sisters, three of which are at the   dishwashing age. You'd think one of them would do them. Still, I   have an ominous feeling that I will be burdened with the chore as I   am burdened with so many other things. Sometimes I can't stand   my family. Fortunately, my step-mother is no longer part of that life. I should   really be calling her what she now is: my father's ex-wife. That fits so   much better. I'm just glad she's gone. Life would be much more   hectic with her still here. She's a bi-polar wrech who refuses to take   her pills. Did I mention that she cheated on my father when they   were married? One more reason for me to despise her. I despise   any person who cheats on their spouse or partner or whatever you   want to call the person you are in some way or another bonded to. It   may not be a happy bond, but theres nothing that excuses cheating   in my eyes. I will never cheat on my fiancee and I hope to God that   he never cheats on me. I would be crushed. I've been watching that timer like a hawk since I started. I'm so tired   of typing that it hurts. Literally. But with a minute and a half left, I must   press on. Ha! It's a pun and I didn't even realize it! I'm so clever.  Some would argue that point, but I still think I have my shining   moments. Everybody needs their shining moments. Without shining   moments, we're just dull. Afterall, what's the opposite of shiny? Dull.  I never want to be dull. I'm certain that people already find me dull,   but as long as I don't know about it, it's all good. I just hope they   never say it to my face. That would make me either sad or mad. I   guess it depends on the weather that day. But people who know me   don't think I'm dull. At least I hope not. I just don't like waiting all   afternoon for a bus that takes thirty minutes to run. And you can   quote me on that one. So there. Yep. 
__label__label0      lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 00 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 0. instructor, 0. teachers assistant, 0. myself, 0. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a0 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 0 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 00 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face 
__label__label1      what classes do i take next semester?  i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it?  is it too much for me?  i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what God has in store for me, and what he thinks I should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children I will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that God has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that God has blessed me with several things and I am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, I may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason God has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.  
__label__label0   o. k try not to think. just let all your thoughts come together. this is not as easy as i thought it was going to be. the guy next door is still playing that crappie music. i wish i could go one day without hearing that, but i think it's ok my roommate just walked in and started to talk to me so i lost my train of thought. alright he left. i'm glad mary, his girlfriend, is going home. i hope they don't walk back in here and see what i just wrote but is suck last night hearing them makeout when i was trying to sleep. but she's cool. my hands are getting tried of typing. i don't know if i can make it the whole 00 min. now he's playing a new song but he turned it off. thank god. we need to clean up, this place is nasty. i don't know if i going to be able to get eric to clean. the bathroom is nasty. im run out of things to say and write. eric has some gay sunglass. i hope he doesnt wear them around me. i hope i just didnt offend my teacher or who ever reads this by saying gay. i hope my teacher doesnt think now i think he's gay, not that there's anything wrong with that. thats like that episode of Sinfied. i don't think i spelled that right. i don't have time to change it. just 0 more minutes. i didnt write that much. i hope i still get i good grade, im just i slow typer. time is almost up i need something to do after this. ill call dan well maybe not i don't want him to think i have no other friends    
__label__label0 I'm in my roomate's room right now, since my computer is not hooked up to the internet yet. I never realized how little she does. She has a piece of paper, apparently meant to be a homework assignment, but it's covered with the most random, 0st grade-type drawings I've ever seen. She obviously put a lot of effort into this. I guess she was trying to avoid doing her assignment. This room is a mess. I can't wait until my computer's working. I haven't checked my e-mail in a while. I guess I should do that, seeing as how I'm expecting scholarship information. I really need some more money, preferably free money. It'd be nice to not have to work for once in my life. Not like my parents help me. PROPNAME have better things to spend it on, like my spoiled-rotten older sister who can't fend for herself because she's never had to. I wish I could call Mom evry month and tell her how much money I'll be needing this month to survive. It's pretty ridiculoous when you have to give plasma for food. I need to just file for independence, I basically support myself anyways. I'm actually thinking about getting my wisdom teeth pulled at one of those labs that tests anesthetics on you. I'm supposed to pay for it myself, but how the hell am I going to afford that?  Rent's coming up and I haven't even received all my financial aid money yet. Oh, well. Maybe I can somehow either win the lotto or get discovered. I'm going to a modeling contest in a week. Hopefully thing will go well there. I really need to get out of LOCNAME. My boyfriend PROPNAME lives 0 hours away in west LOCNAME. He's supposed to start playing college football again in the Spring. There's going to be draft people there form the ORGNAME. That'd be pretty cool too, except that if he moved to a different state, he'd want me to go with him. I'm not sure I want to succeed in getting out of here through him. PROPNAME, my roommate, has some of my stuff in here. That kind of pisses me off. I don't take her shit. my other roommate PROPNAME owes me $00 dollars. I need it for my psychology book (ironic, isn't it?). I found out yesterday that he owes all his friends money, almost $0000 total. I don't think I'm going to be seeing that money anytime soon. I don't get payed for another week, and my job pays crap. I want to get a new job, one that actually pays me decently, but unfortunately, I love my shitty job. I graduate in 0 0/0 years if things go right. That is, if I can get into the Psychology Dept. (once again, ironic). Why is Psychology the only major in Lberal Arts that I actually have to apply for?  I could've have gotten in easily when I first applied for school if I had known what I wanted to do. Oh, well, not much I can do about it now. I've missed way too many classes already, and it's only the 0rd week. I've never been sick in my life, and now my immune system decides to go on a vacation. I wonder if my parents realize that I'm probably never going to talk to them again after I graduate?  I know if I mean that or not. Sometomes I think I do. I don't think soomeone going to school full-time should ever be burdened as much as I am by financial responsibilities. It's jsut not right when, according to everything I've applied for, they make too much money. 
__label__label0      I am feeling sad but feeling so much better. Yesterday was hopeless, today there is hope. I am realizing that I am so much more complete without my boyfriend than I was with him. Next time I will not let someone control my thoughts and actions so completely. Next time I will not let myself make excuses for someone. I have learned a lot. I feel like I want to kiss him so bad, to feel his lips on mine, to feel his skin on mine. I want him to hold me all night and tell me everything is all right. But in my heart I know it is. It is so hard to be his friend but I want to so much. He says he doesn't want to lose me. It is funny, we see each other more often now that we are just friends. And no that is not friends with benefits. There is no way I would let him take advantage of me like that. . but it would be so much fun. Then it would hurt so much. It's really not hard to be with him, I love being with him. The hard part is leaving him. Every time I do I feel like I may never see him again. He hugs me and says it will be ok, babe, I promise. I know he is right, it will. I just wish it was going to be like I thought it was going to be. I had such big plans for this fall. After waiting on him all summer, who could blame me?  He seemed so perfect for me last May. What happened?  I need to stop asking myself these questions and move on with my life, I know that. But being his friend and seeing him all the time is going to make that more difficult. I am just trying to be as sweet as possible and show that there are no hard feelings. I really am not mad at him; I just wish I could change the way he felt. Alright, that is not really true. The truth is, I wish he was a different person. I wish he was the person I imagined he was and truly believed he was all summer. Instead, I fell in love with a commitment-phobic guy who drinks to much and actually owns a rifle. I can't believe I could be so stupid. He looks so sweet and innocent. I am moving on though. Or I will be shortly. I just need to dwell for a little longer. Like I said, there is hope today. I know I am beautiful and intelligent and witty and sweet, I don't need him to tell me that. I just wish I had someone who would. I am trying so hard to be independent but I have never really had a significant other I could depend on so I guess it's not that hard. I guess I am just in love with the idea of being in love. I want to be swept off my feet. I just hope I'm not infected with that crazy disease where I can only love people who don't love me back because I want to make people love me. I really hope I don't push people away. I try so hard to be a good girlfriend but when someone doesn't call you when he says he's going to and leaves you hanging a million times, what are you supposed to do besides get upset and threaten to break up with them?  I definitely put up with his shit for way too long. I know he will be a better friend than a boyfriend. It will just be so hard if I have to see him or hear about him with someone else. Especially if that someone else happens to be his ex-girlfriend. She tried to get back together with him this summer when I was 0 hours away. What a bitch, I can't believe she would do that. I hope he isn't still in love with her. Oh well, there is nothing I could do about that anyway. Didn't I say there was hope today?  Well, there is:  for the first time in days, I actually felt hungry. It felt so good to eat and not feel like I was going to throw up. It also felt good to not burst into tears every five minutes. Yeah, there were a few times when I would have liked to, but I think I did alright today. After all it has been only a little over 00 hours since he made his decision. I am doing very well, I think. I think it is helping that he wants to be my friend. When I told him I didn't know because it would be hard, he begged me, saying,   Please try, I don't want to lose you.   I am glad he did that because I don't want to lose him either. Even if he is all wrong for me, at least he can be there as a friend for me. He says he might want a relationship with me eventually but I don't want to wait for him. I can't. It would end up making me more miserable than ever. I think I am better off just going on with my life and talking to him only as a friend. I think the more I see him the more I will realize how wrong he is for me. I need someone who will put me before his buddies and who will love me with everything he has. I need someone who is ready to make a committment to me. I need someone who will send me flowers just because he is thinking about me. I need a fairytale romance, I need to be swept off my feet, I need love, real love, crazy love. Like all the songs, all the cliches, that is what I want more than anything. And I don't even know if I believe it exists. I want to, but c'mon folks, let's be realistic. Somehow my parents still manage to love each other but there is not really much passion there, at least that I am aware of. Maybe there is, but I doubt it. If true love is more than just a friendship, that means it involves chemistry and passion, but that stuff fades, it always fades. So what is to separate a strong, passionate friendship with true love?  Fucked if I know. All I know is, things are really looking up for me now. I'm going to be just fine. :) 
__label__label0 Hi my name is jennifer doolan. . i am writing because i was told to for an assignment. i am not sure what i am thinking exactly.

__label__label0      PROPNAME benjamin's writhing assingment, september 00, 0000. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. Everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but I don't think it would be so bad. In the meantime, I still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. I do not want to read it! It is simply boring! Blah, Blah, Blah, building, blah blah blah. I am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. I wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats Thermal Delight in Architecture that is. It is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). BORING!. On thursday, I have Visual Communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. The proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he DOES NOT. I honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. Anyways, i am majoring in somehing I love to do, so I guess i can trudge though the school. Some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at ORGNAME, the consumer of business). Speaking of stuff i love to do, I love music! I really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since I have been wanting to do architecture since I was like, FOUR, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . .  On a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the COUNTER RESET!!! NOOOOO! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 000? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 000, and i knew people there. speaking of people from ORGNAME ORGNAME, one of them is in this class. Say hello to PROPNAME PROPNAME everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well TRY to call him out) you get your own personl shout out PROPNAME! from the Proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). Jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is I LOVE WHAT I DO and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . AND again, I won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i CAN  T SPELL worth CRAP&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. Darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products! (oh wait. we already are!) I am running win XP right now :) i do like it, it hasn't crashed yet. . knock on wood. it would crash while i am doing something for class though, with my terrible luck. (spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 0 minutes left! Hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! Muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. I guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! It would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . WHOOPS! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. I find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in Arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 00min are up, and i have to sleep myself!   
__label__label0      Well here i sit at college and Its kind of weird. IN the next room there is music playing which I like. It makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that I went to. It was in good ole LOCNAME, and I was Occumpanied by my cousin. Now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending ORGNAME ORGNAME. She now lives in LOCNAME, what a tough life. My room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. I always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. Actually it is quite organized. I have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as I have grown older I have realized that indeed I do enjoy some sense of organization. My roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that I have. Coming from LOCNAME, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from LOCNAME. A friend away from home you could say. My connection in the bussiness. . haha, I didnt always live there though, I came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. Im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but I do remember that it was right before I entered High school and it was still a major adjustment. I went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. My high school that is. Now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. That is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than I could have imagined on that friday night. Nothing could go right. I miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. You never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. I have not written much lately, and I know that I should have been writing every day. I once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. That and reading, but I know that I will have no shortage of reading this year. I have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. I enjoy reading. I guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. When your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. You think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. Somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. Inspire or say something meaningful. Its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. With so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. You can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. You have to find the median. The happy place you could say. Not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. You can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. You have to make it happen. As clich'e as it sounds, its true. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME and the Stones,   You can't always get what you want. .   You could say that they truly are wise old men. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. Amen brother. Spoken by a true poet. I have always liked comedy in my writing. Not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. I mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. If they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. It was a wasted tree. Often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. I by no means claim to be a great writer nor do I claim to make people laugh, I am simply claiming that I like to laugh as I read. I enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. If it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. It is a shame that I do not write as much as I used to. The Ideas are there, I just have not gotten them out yet. They will be there, it will just take time. I guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. My memory is not the greatest right now, at 00 years old. When I hit seventy or beyond, I can't wait until I have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. . 
__label__label1      College? I wonder how it will be? I just started it. It seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but I wonder is it something I will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         This is my first time living away from home and the ones I love and care about it. I feel the necessity to show to my peers that I'm not scared and do not miss home. But in fact i miss my home and my sister who I fought with all times. I don't know why I feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. I can't understand that part of my mind. Is it because I want to fit in the croud? Is it because I want to show others that I'm strong?           On the other hand - I love what I have been experiencing for the past week. I have experienced things I have never before. I never had to do mylaundry myself and now I do that and I find that I like doing it. I have to go to eat myself. At home the plate was always on the dinner. I feel as if I was spoiled at home and that I was given too much. Here I realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. And that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  I have learnt to handle things on my own. At home, if i met someone I didnt like, it was as if  I ignored them but here I realized that it is difficult to ignore 00000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . So far I can say that college has taught me more than I thought it would.          College is not the only thing on my mind. I think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? How will I manage to survive financially? If I will make a good living in the future? I question myself why I think so much about the future and so little about the present. I give undue importance to the future and not to the present. My thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. Things done turn out the way i want them to. I end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          But thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. I question myself if I really do believe in God. My faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. Losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but I coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. But when I lost when my father, I really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person I was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. I decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. But when i lost her at the age of 00, I thought forget God. He doesnt exist. However looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in God. I wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        I used to always think about eating food. But since the past year that it had changed. But i'm back to the way i was. I wonder if I'm a emotional eater? When i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. However when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. I would love to visit a shrink to get to know if I'm a emotional eater. 
__label__label1      Well, ORGNAME seems to be a very confortable place. I like my classes fairly well. Claculus and Physics will probably be the most difficult. Chemistry seems like it will be very easy. . and Psycology. well psycology looks to be very interesting. I talked to my sister last night. She graduated from UT with a degree in psycology. All she told me was,   don't get hooked. we don't need two psycology degrees in the family. and at least someone's got to make the money.   That someone being me. I really love my sister. she is a very unique person. Her life has been a blast. She likes to go places and have fun. . she's got a hugh fun-excited spirit. She's been to LOCNAME LOCNAME. . and now she lives in LOCNAME. I almost went skydiving with her a couple weeks back when I visited, but the weather got real bad the day we were going to jump. I think it will take me a litle while to totally accustom myself to LOCNAME. it's hard leaving the people I love. . my family and my girlfriend. I am in a very serious relationship. We've been together fro almost a year now. . and I think that we're going to make it through all this time apart and end up very happy together. Man this is taking a long time. I miss my brother. He is a marine. He joined the reserves back in January of 0000. last january he got a call saying his unit was being activated and he would have to leave for LOCNAME in two days. So mid january of this year he and one of his good high school friends who just so happened to end up in the same unit drove down to LOCNAME. From LOCNAME they were sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME for some training. they stayed there for a couple weeks, then were sent to the east coast. . somewhere near the cheasapeake bay area and had to go through a few months of training. They did some pretty neat stuff like riot training and stuff like that. he was able to to call us every now and then, and it was good to hear from him. Then after he was done with his training he was finally sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. There he and his unit were stationed for patrol duty. . basically they drive around the outer wall and patrol it. Since he has been there he really hasn't had much time to talk to us. He did take his laptop so he can get on the internet to e-mail, but he isn't given much time to do that. every now and then he gave us a call. He called the day of graduation to see how I was doing. I really wish he could have been there to see me give my speach. It was just not the same without him. He acctually called me here the other day. at about 00:00 at night. so I didn't want to talk long cause it was keeping my roommate up. But He comes home in November. . so it won't be ong before I see himn again. When he gets back my sister is coming down from LOCNAME to pick him up. . then they are coming over to LOCNAME to see me. . and we're all going to go skydiving!  I can't wait. I'm going back home this weekend. I leave tommorow right after my last class. I'll get to LOCNAME around 0:00 in time to see the high school football game. We won state last year. But my girlfriend is in the drill team. . so I'll get to see her perform, I miss her a lot. time is almost over. I've got a little moer homeowrk till I can get to work on a project I've been planning. I'm making my girlfriend a cd. . well actually two cd's. I think she will like them. It felt really good to sleep in a little today. Thursdays are the only day I don't have an 0:00 class!  so I like thursday. well. . time is running down. . only a few seconds left. . so I'll say adeu. . till we meet agian. 
__label__label0      Ok so my roommate is sleeping ORGNAME I have til 0 when my scuba class is started to do whatever when I am done writing this. . . I think I'll get online ORGNAME talk to people like I normally do. . talk to my friends in RR since I haven't met too many peopel down here. . . well I've met them, just haven't gotten to know anyone. So I'll get online ORGNAME listen to music. . . I hope I can get another job offer since I want to go camping on the 00th-00th & my training for the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is o nthe 00th. . man I don't want to tell everyone to go sat night & tude on sunday because we already talked about going friday afternoon. . of course even going friday afternoon they have to wait on me to get outta class at like 0 I believe but still. . tehy'd hafta wait til I got out at 0 pm on saturday if I did get a job at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. I need some kind of job so maybe I should just go to the interview & try to get the job. . it won't be that big of deal if we wait til sat & I could even meet them up there if it's a problem. . . I want to work at Urban Outfitters though because I coudl get discounts on cool clothes & room accessories & it's closer & prolley less demanding that working as an usher. . Of course being an usher would be cool because of free concerts & stuff but at the same time I wouldn't be able to sit w/friends or anything at those concerts but it's ok. . . & starting rate for the ORGNAME is $0 which is more than I was making at ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. I think any job would pay me more than ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . except of course LOCNAME but that's not a real job. . . Man 00 minutes is a long time. . Tru LIes was a good movie last night. . Ultimate frisbee was fun once half the guys left. . . I had no clue what was going on when there was 0 on each team but when it was 0 on each team I got better because there was less going on. . plus the guys had no choice but to throw it to me. . . There were only 0 of us. . we won though & I scored a point & assisted the winning point for our team so they couldn't have been that disappointed to have the girl on their team. . . I can't wait for the Two Towers to come out this winter. I'm so mad that PROPNAME lost that book! PROPNAME PROPNAME 0 will be very good too & I know PROPNAME is like counting down the days. . I can't believe PROPNAME' mom. . PROPNAME & I will always be friends despite the fact that I'm in college. PROPNAME is gonn agraduate & come here anyways. . I need PROPNAME to make me laugh. PROPNAME is my giudence counselor friend & PROPNAME is my fellow geeky to laugh w/friend. . you need both kinds & I'm glad I have both kinds. . even though PROPNAME has headaches all the time which aren't her fault. . I feel sorry for her but at the same time, she's a wimp. . & her many boy problems & many boys starring her down do get annoying. . that was so funny when PROPNAME noticed that after being w/her for like 00 minutes. of course she wAS TALKIGN a lot more than she normally does that night after working first night  at  ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . I was excited the first night PROPNAME talked to me too. the boy is gorgeous! Too bad he had a girlfriend. . not that that would mean we would've hooked up or anything. . just would have been nice to know he was available. I am drawing a blank on what to write now. . this fan kleeps blowing my hair & it's annoying me but I know this room gets hot when you sleep so I'll leave it on for PROPNAME. . i NEED to put a tack in the bottom of that paper there because that thing kept me up for like an hour last night. . I was so tired last night. I can't believe it took me so long to fall asleep. maybe I'll just take PROPNAME's idea & take a nap for a bit before my scuba class. this scuba class better be good because I really wanted to take a karate class or a self-defense class. not for the actual use of self-defense like the wussy girls taking that class. . I want to know that I can kick someone's ass if need may be. . I think I could put up a pretty damn good fight if I really did get mad enough. . even my play punches are hard acording to others. . that makes me feel like a butch girl though so I don't appriciate it when I am told that. Use those arms   Ugh! I shoulda stopped! Oh well! & the phone is ringing but she's asleep so she won't answer & there will be a message & that stupid machine beeps until you check it-good no message. . 
__label__label1 Ok, well here's the first writing assnment. To begin with, i'm really, really hungry. As is the case, in many college student's lives, i only woke up about an hour ago, and so havent' eaten anything. I've already done laundry though, so I guess you could say i'm semi=productive. I've also talked to Road Runner because they came out the other day and installed the new cable modem in my apartment, but it didn't work. So i tried all the diagnostics that they told me to do, and it still didn't work so i called them this morning. As is always the case, it worked when they asked me to go to the internet, so I seemed like a fool. Well, as soon as we hung up the phone, i tried the internet again, and it didn't work. . I'm pissed. So now i have to use my roommate's computer and a regular internet connection, which is slower than anything else you can imagine.  But on to other things. I'm going to play football with my co-workers from the club on 0th street (the VIBE). It's amazing how you never know when or where a friend might come from. It has always been my belief that a boss will never be a friend, even though it may seem so at times. . . it's really just business. But these guys are different. Perhaps it's the type of business, or maybe they are the one-in-a-million type, or maybe even i'm mistaken, but either way, we're going out to play football as soon as i finish writing this journalistic internet assignment. My best friend had his truck towed yesterday, and the day before he had his wallet stolen, so of course he came to me wanting to know if i'd lend him some money and take him to get his truck back. So, being the good friend that i am, i went to the bank and withdrew 000 dollars and took him to the towyard to get his truck. However, since he didn't have a liscense, i had to sign for the truck, wich only means that i could get into a world of trouble if he ever wanted to screw with me. Apparently by me signing for the truck, my friend could come back the next day and ask for his truck, and since it wouldn't be there, it would be   stolen   which meant i would be held accountable for grand=theft=auto. But i assured my friend that even though he is bigger than i am, i have a lot more friends that are bigger than he is. . you never can tell with people. So back to being hungry again, now my stomach is growling, and i wish i would have eaten before doing this thing. Of course, i am only half way finished, and i grow hungrier as each minute passes. I really shouldn't be playing football today though, because i should be reading all the assignments for my various classes, but what good would that do me?. . . really, i would be a unsocial. . . and besides, i like football better than studying. I guess that's wjhy my grades are the way they are, but who cares, i was a grade worrier all through high school. . i never got a B in my entire li0fe and graduated top 0% (00th of 000). BIG DEAL. I've realized now after 0 years of college that grades really don't mean that much. I mean, yes, you have to graduate and all, but how hard is it to make a 0. 0?  I've failed a couple of classes now, and still have a 0. 0, so you obviously have to REALLY screw up in order to make below a 0 ORGNAME. I guess i shouldn't talk that way, because school is hard for some people, but then again, htat's just an excuse, because i think that anyone can learn somehting, you just have to find the right way to get to them. It's like physics. I can teach anyone physics, it's just a matter of how you explain things. BAck in highschool, my physics teacher was horrible at explaining things, and everyone was alwyas confused, but i would re-explain using every-day examples, and then they would understand. I explained circuit-theory using the large highways in houston (where i lived) as the   circuits  . The cars were the   moving charges  , on-ramps were like batteries, and so forth. Using this method, all the people that i tutored on average scored at least a grade point higher. . give or take. ANyway, i just wish i had it in me to be a teacher because i know i'd be a good one. I just can't see myself teaching. I want to own businesses, and yezs, make a lot of money. I have a business eye. everywhere i go, i'm always seeking a new way to make money, or what business i could start that would flourish. Well, it's almost over, and i must say, i'm not as hungy \as i was at first. So thats it. There's my mind in a nutshell! 
__label__label0    i don't know what i write i mean am i supposed to write . . whatever. . pete sampras is strugglin, tv is good i like watching tv, i ahte it when it runs crap shows though, it's just no good man. pete sampras is leaving andres agassi in the us open finals. i haven't played tennis in a while. . pete sampras' wife is pregnant. . wow. . she's the teacher from billy madison. my roommate said he had dreams about her. crazy. i hope pete sampras wins. he hasn't won anything for the past two years. tennis players grunt a lot. im trying to think about what to write. it's not too bad i guess i'll just try to keep on typing andy roddick is gay. i would like to be rich some day. i get good grades in economics? but i don't know what to do in the future. i've never even had a job before, i don't know what im going to do. i think the stock market's going to crash again. . a second dip, oh well. it doesn't matter anyways. things like that happen all the times. im tired i just ate barbeque, there are some leftovers but they're all mixed up with potato salad and beans and beef and it's just a bad combination. i would like to go to europe sometime. my speakers on my computer suck. i want to play videogames i would rather do that than do this now but i need a good grade this semester i have to get a 0. 0 gpa at least to get into the business school it's going to be so tough i mean, this year with the largest damn freshman class there's going ot be so much competition ig uess. i like to play golf i haven't played golf in a month i would really like to do that right now i think i figured out what i was doing wrong before now i would like to try out my new grip that'll be cool if i could now. a few of my friends have a show at fitzgeralds next weekend, it's their forth show and they're missing a lead singer, i think they kind of want me to do it but i don't really want to,b ut should i make myself want to? would that help me in life, as in taking more chances and be  more social? im not a very social person i would like to be but i just can't. i think i have somewhat of a low self esteem but not low enough to make me hardcore depressed like some people. . eh i have 00 more minutes to go this isn't all that bad. i forgot what i was thinking, my friend hongpoo just came over he's watching the tennis match on my computer as im typing this. i like music music is good sampras is ripping some serves, he's got like 00 aces but he's got 00 double faults. the crowd's cheering. billy madison was a good movie. my roommate says sampras' a lucky bastard. ted? head? oh hongpoo hates head. he says they're bad rackets. which way is a better way to spell racquet? racquet or racket? im going to play some tennis after doing this assignment i hope there aren't questions after this four all!!!!! maybe veronica vaughn just got fat maybe she's not pregnant afterall. iu would like the sampras forehand, it's freakin amazing. got him. got him good. alskdjflasdkjfksdjfahhhhh! hongpoo's going to write the samething about me, what is he thinking does he think he's smarter than i am?  i i think im watching tv because i need thoughts i don't really think i just kind of chill and don't do much. sick! im going to listen to some weezer now they're a pretty good band, not amazing like some other bands but they're good agassi double faulted. yeah agassi's pretty damn good. i would definitely like agassi's backhand it's freakin awesome sampras has a 0 hander, but i don't know i like agassi's better, sampras has a better forehand though it's freakin flat and fast it's awsome say it ain't so? yeah . i need to learn how to play more songs on the guitar i have a nice guitar but id on't play it enough, sampras is going to win the us open he's pretty good. he needs to win he's going to win. yeah i hate macs, they're so stupid about things like how they're all overprotective about their technology and stuff that's why they suck balls. pc's are better not because of their performance, but because they're so loose about everything like i could make one myself actually i did built my own computer so that proves my point. elvis is the man. i want to play tennis too man. tv card on the computer is pretty cool it's like having a tv but not. pete sampras is going to have the most grandslams . 00 yeah. . im done 
__label__label0 My fiance is making me do my writing assignment now. He just pushed me in front of the computer. This is my third time to try and do this thing. I'm really hoping that it works this time. It gets kind of frustrating. PROPNAME wants to read what I'm typing. He's making me nervous because I don't want him to read this, but I'm sure he'll figure some way to see it. He says that I don't trusthim because i don't want him to read it. I don't like loud noises, especially from things like vacuums. PROPNAME is vacuuming right now. I don't like it when people play music loud either. It just bothers me. I love PROPNAME, sometimes I just don't get what he expects from me. I am so tired. I haven't slept since I came to LOCNAME. Thats probably because my bed is broken and no one has come to fix it yet. I'm really thirsty. I just walked back to campus from the capitol. PROPNAME bought me one of those glowing necklace things. September 00th makes me sad. I was is my chemisty class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and the principal made an announcement for all of us to meet in the cafeteria. I didn't believe it at first. Why does PROPNAME always bug me. He likes to see how much he can annoy me. I love him, but I don't like to be bothered. I'm starting to get really sleepy. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My freshman seminar should be a really easy class, but I don't do well speaking in front of people and I'm not very creative. I'm probably the least creative person on the planet. I want to go home. I can't wait until friday because I get to go home. Sometimes I think that I can't stand my family, but when I'm in Austin, I wish I was home with them. My roommate is out with some weird guy she met on the internet. I swear she's with a new one every day. I'm afraid something bad is going to happen to her. Raquetball is fun to play. PROPNAME and I were supposed to play yesterday, but we forgot. Its really hot in here. I'm usually always cold.  My contacts are bothering me. I think I need to put in a new pair. I'm really thirsty. I wonder what other people are writing about. I've always wondered what other people think about. I wonder if people think as weird of things as me. Sometimes I think really weird things and have no idea why. I really like cranberry juice. Its pretty good. I need to clean my room. My roommate and I are both really messy. It looks pretty bad. I really like frogs. I have so much frog stuff. I feel like I've been typing forever. Time seems to be going incredibly slow. A Walk to Remember is a really good movie. Sometimes I miss working at the movies. but I hated working there too. I guess that's just the way it goes. My fish are pretty cool. There salt water fish and are very pretty. I don't like it when PROPNAME touches me in certain places. I just don't want to be touched there. It doesn't make me feel good. But if I say anything to him about it, he gets mad, and thinks that I don't love him and don't want to mess around with him, etc. I really don't feel good. My trashbags smell like vanilla. They smell pretty good without the trash in them. Three minutes left. Yay. Jesse freaks out over the strangest things, especially anything star trek. I don't like that show. I'm don't like most things that are sci-fi. I used to though, I'm not sure why I don't anymore. Time goes by really really slow. Work is boring. I never actually do much work. Making copies isn't exactly exciting. But I'm not exactly exciting anyways. I also have no sense of humor and can be incredibly boring at times. Yay!! I'm finally done. That took forever. 
__label__label0      Right now I am sitting in my room. my TV ison and I'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. I have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as UT does. Right now I'm here in my dorm room, it kind ORGNAME smells like B. O. , but I think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up ORGNAME mess that my room-mate and I have made. The TV is on right now and it's kind of distracting but I'm not going to say anythign because I would consider that rude. Is it bad that I put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. Dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth I really don't care what others think about me. All i care about is what I think of myself, and whether I'm happy with myself or not. At this point I'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. I miss it though. I really don't think that I was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. Is it bad that I don't like school?I know that it's only going to   benefit my future   and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. People don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. It does not cost anything to dream. I'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. I'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. I think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. I set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then I have a total break down. I feel as though I am a failure and I probably will not amount to anything. If you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. I'm sure that by now you can tell that. I'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. I'm very much more comfortable with a 00:0 ratio classes. I'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a   B   I would say   A   but that goes back to my really high standards. Instead of being dissappointed I would rather achieve something that I know that I can probably complete. I think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. I will always wonder if I was ever able to fufill that   A   that i wasnt but never really went for. Does this make me a bad person? I think not. I'm really considering going to a university back home. I'm here in the college of Fine Arts in the Dance department. What can you really do with a ORGNAME in Dance? I'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? There goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. I think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. I'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. I understand that UT isn't a specialized conservatory in the Arts, but if you are going to offer a major in Dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. I am really considering majoring in Psychology with a minor in Dance. The university back home, ORGNAME of the ORGNAME ORGNAME, offers a minor in dance and a major in Psychology which sounds like the perfect program. I was also thinking about Mass Media. I was thinking about being a talent agent. I need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I'm not sure what that is right now. 
__label__label1      So this is my first writing assignent for college. I keep forgetting that I am actually in school, and not on vacation of some sort. I just got out of bad and am havign a lot of feelings right now, all about non-important things, like boys. I am mad I lost my earing last night, mad that i still have feelings for my ex-boyfriend in a way, and mad that I don't know what to do about people here. It is just a totally different experience then anything else and I wonder when I will get used to it. I think i also need to learn how to type better and use punctuation! IMs never need punctuation or capitilization. or even correct spelling. Roommate is still gone, staying with her boyfriend, and its ok because i like him better now. Before I thought he was boring adn not as nice as PROPNAME, but he is quite goofy and is always nice to em, though soemtimes I get the feeling its because he feels that I am a dork who just goes wherever PROPNAME goes. People kept telling us that rooming together would be a problem, but so far we have only had issues once, right before school started when we were spending way too much time together, and that was not good. That one night she left to stay at PROPNAME's and walked out saying, have fun, made me want to punch her, because obviously I was just going ot be hanging out in the room, alone. Now that I am meeting people on my own out of   the group  , its much easier to do things and feel like I have a life. I still need to meet more people in my hall, and in classes, but most of them are so big that just being there I feel like not really participating. Going to the lake on labor day was quite an adventure, and one I am glad I had without PROPNAME. and jumping off the cliff was one of the coolest things i have done in a while. It also made me glad that no other girls went off the 00 foot cliff. I like doing things that girls normally don't do in these group situations, like the firebreathing and the shotgunning a beer. . but having done it once, I don't need to do that again. but I stil almost beat that guy when we did it, hehe. I don't understand why people drink beer- it tastes horrible and I have heard that after about 0, you don't taste it anymore. . but that means you have to drink 0 of them and then you must be getting pretty mindless to keep drinking somthing you don't like in the first place. Then it seems more like somthing people do to be   cool  , or whatever else people think they need to do. I have seen less of that in college. people seem more laid back in general about all sorts of things, but then again, there are still sorority girl types out there. I can't get over my dislike of the idea of sororities, probably because I don't know many girls well who are in them. I have been mostly meeting the guys in PROPNAME's fraternity, and they are all nice, and not all mindless drinkers (mostly c. s. majors or engineers) and I am gald that i got to meet them all. . but they are all older then me. I used to love to tell people how young I actually was because they were always shocked, saying things like,   oh, you don't look/ act   however old I was at the time. My birthday was just over 0 weeks ago, and that sort of blows my mind because of all the things that have happened so far. Its like every phase of my life is separate from everything else that has happened in my life. its hard to even think of middle school anymore, and even freshman year of high school seems like someone elses life. Its also hard to belive that everything with PROPNAME just happened last month, that we broke up in August and now its just September, barely, but it still feels like forever since it happened. OH CRAP. the phone just rang and it was some one asking me to go to the co-op with her- yeah! no more looser-dom! But then somehow I hit somthing that made the site go away and now that I'm back ,the timer has started all over again. Well, I think I have about 00 more minutes. So, all I have accomplished today was sleeping until noon, which has to be my sleep limit, I NEVER used to do that. and now I guess I will go to the co-op to return a book and hang out with PROPNAME, and then. I guess I have to get ready for my   date  , I guess thats what it is. I am not looking forward to it anymore after last night, I don't know were we are going or even if I want to go anymore. So yesterday PROPNAME was telling me about her comparitive values seminar, and how they had to come to class with somthing to share that they were   absolutely certain   about, somthing not-ohysical that they could prove. PROPNAME said that   I am me  , and that seems certain enough to me. . but another girl said that she is a woman, and they just picked that apart in class because really, how can you be certain of that? I think the point of that class is to weird you out and show you that nothing is certain. . so as if you werent already clueless enough at this point in your life, now you have some class where they tell you nothing is for sure. Besides physical things, what makes me a woman? The way I act? Why do I act the way I do? Those questions could go on forever with no answer, but it really made me think about the whole gender thing. Possibly I am a gay man trapped in a woman's body? Oh, the lady in the cafeteria-place today called me   sir  . I can't believe that happened, she said she couldnt see me around the sign or sneeze guard or whatever was there in front of her but. she called me sir! Brings back not-good thoughts of LOCNAME thinking it was funny to call me   butch   and PROPNAME telling me that I am   just one of the guys  . yah, maybe some gender issues here. I am a woman! Even if its not totally certain according to all this deep philosophy stuff, I AM a woman, and I happen to like boys, and I am pretty sure I don't resemble a guy (even with my upper-body buff-ness from swim team) but it is still a sore topic for me. It doesnt help that I am tall. oh! another phone call. I think my time should be up but the timer is all off, so I will say that this is 00 minutes and that is that! 
__label__label0      College. . humm. Its strange that I'v made it this far. I always viewed college as a date in a book that i would eventually reach, but not now. There is absolutely nothing familiar anymore. My days are completely different. I guess change is good though, I mean there is no place I would rather be in life than right here. So why am I so worried all the time?  Constantly tierd. My eye has developed a slow twitch, very strange. I miss my cat. I wish I had the ability to purr. If only I were a cat. The weirdest thing about college is waking up. Every day of my life until now I have woken up in my bed or some state of comfort. Now when I wake up there is that small period of time when I think I am still there, safe, but then reality smacks me in the face. My roomate is really good at that in the morning, helping me realize that im not at home. Very annoying! I wish i enjoyed my roomates companey, but I don't not at all. She smacks while eatting, very inconsiderate, keeps the room at 00000 million degrees. Ah What am I going to do, not a whole lot, I guess its a good learning expeirence. I must say I have met some cool people though, which make the ride all worth while. Counting Crows,, ahh, for some reason they know exactly what I am feeling. They   hit the nail on the head  . I wish I could talk to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and spell correctly. The thing that I have noticed about college is there are more headachs and less sleep. more headachs, less sleep. I really should deal with this problem. It seems impossible with all the things I have to get done but eventually I have found that everything works it self out. Time, time , time. I do not believe in time. There really is no point to time. Well at least keeping track of. I mean time is good for healing and new stages in life. But why do  we put it on such a small scale. I mean it should just be a concept, like infinity. I mean I wish I could not say at this exact moment it is . . 00. 00. 00. There should only be moments and nothing more. We all live in one big moment. Another thing thats been on my mind is something A friend and I were talking about. He said why does society make squares out of everything. I mean think about it the majority of buildings in this world are in the square shape, rooms are square, tiles are square, I think I might go out in the square hallway and take a drink from the square water fountian. It is exausting. Why would someone go to such detail to make a square out everything. The name square even sugessets boring. Why not an oval, or better yet an amiba. No one can box me in. I also am frustrated with the fact that everyone wants to have a career,Example,   Yeah I'm pre-med, ohh yeah well I'm going to be an engineer    I really have to desier to   make something of myself  . What my career will be is sitting in LOCNAME,no preference really any where in LOCNAME will do, with a big family,lots of animals, and friends walking around soaking upp all the history, looking at the arcitecture, and most importaltly just being happy. I could just learn the rest of my life. with no money , which is a square by the way. . 
__label__label1 It's late and the fan is on it keeps spratically blowing on my arm. My arm is getting kind of cold. I have been reading for about an hour now and my eyes are kind of lazy. I have some catching up to do on my homework and i need to go get a book tomorrow, the one i got online was the wrong one. today was a long day, i'm glad it's over. three classes and a long work-out session. i like it though, the working out, it make me feel. . . good. i like to feel good. tomorrow is going to be an easy day. ony one class. my nails look bad i sure need a manicure. the fan is really relaxing with the blowing and the hum sound it makes. there is no other noise, usually there is a radio playing but not tonight, homework was the important thing. i want to do several things this week, attend some meetings for soccer and for this business fraternity that i want to be in. i think it will be fun to be involved with the school. i sure wish i could find some information on the football or baseball spirit groups. thats really what i want to do. i love watching ut play no matter what sport. i was athletic in high school i wish i would have listened to my dad when he said   you should practice, you could get a scholarship   i could have, the demand for girl golfers is pretty high. i didn't listen oh well can't cry over spilt milk. i miss my parents, i know they miss me. my mom calls alot but im glad she calls me because i would fell kind of foolish is i always called home. you know, everytime i visit i get teary eyed. i know that sounds stupid but its getting better though. i love this school though, the only school i ever wanted to go to. been a fan forever. everyone else in my family is an aggie. i will be the first longhorn in family history. pretty cool i think. i wish i could do more with my room. its too small and my closet. man i have no words for that. but i like it here, its close to school and everything else for that matter. the walking across campus kind of sucks but thats ok because its ut campus, that makes all the difference in the world. i can't believe i got into the business school. i still remember finding out like it was yesterday. i was completely speachless. literaly i had to go outside, it was one of the most liberating and self gratifying moments of my life. i am smiling right now. i have alot of pictures of my friends in my room, i miss them too. mainly my best friend PROPNAME, she is getting married in november and i hate that i am not there to help her out with all the wedding stuff, she calls and i always do what i can while i am at home but its not the same. we were neighbors you know. for the better part of out childhood. i am usually not this depressing sounding. i guess its the long day and all the prior homework setting the mood. my arms are starting to hurt because i am typing with my comp on a stool by my bed, sitting on the edge. its a strange position but i havent yet got me a desk. . like i said the room is small and well my comp desk was big. well good night.         
__label__label0  I hope I'm doing this right because I'm not sure. I feel so tired and I have so many things to do in such short time. I wonder if I'll pass all my classes. I'm afraid that I won't make A's and not make it into Medical school. I can imagine how my dad's sisters will laugh at him and tell him that they knew I wasn't going to make it. I feel lost, depressed, and anxious. Who should I talk to, well mayb nobody because what if people think I'm crazy or stupid or something. Everyone else seems relaxed and having a great time. I can't even walk out of my room because I either have homework or some quiz to study. I can't believe I froze today on my quiz and miss two simple questions. What's wrong with me? I used to take pressure fine now I feel like some crazy person. I miss PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He understands me. The good thing is that he's coming down and if my dad brings my truck up here, I can go and pick him up at the airport. I want to bring him back to LOCNAME and show him around. It's going to be nice to walk with him down the Drag and just showing him the campus. I can't wait to see him. I hope everything goes well since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth. I don't want anything to happen to him while he's flying over here. If anything happens to him, I'll feel terrible because I'm the only reason he's coming down. I hope I can have a good weekend with him. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. But with my parents, God, I can imagine them. They take things so seriously. I wish they weren't so strict and understand that me and PROPNAME are serious about each other. I guess that's why I'm so shy. I could never go out or do anything. Now I can't keep a conversation with anyone because I think that they don't like me but oh, well I don't need them. I have such a headache. It's just all these thoughts I have in my head. I wonder who's going to read this. They're going to think I'm some kind of psycho, however you spell that. Life is so crazy for me. I can never relax or kick back. I hope to God that in the end this will pay off. I wish I was already in med school but hey it all takes time. Now I understand what Dr. PROPNAME said. That man is so brillant. I hope to be just like him. He does surgeries like nothing. And to think that he didn't make it to med school here in the LOCNAME and had to go to LOCNAME. If he didn't make it with straight a's here at LOCNAME, what makes me think that I will. What did I get myself into? But this is my dream and I'm afraid to disappoint my family. I've always told them I was going to be a Doctor and if I don't they're going to ask me why, some will laugh at me, others will disapprove of me like Mr. PROPNAME, others will rub it in my face. How embarrassing? Agh! I even got voted most successful in high school. I can imagine everyone talking about me and how I thought I was so smart. If only they knew I had to work really hard for my grades. I was just like them. I want my mom to be proud of me and I want her to know that when she's old I'll take good care of her. I don't want to see her working hard anymore. Well this felt a little better taking everything out but now I feel like crying. Maybe that will help as well.    
__label__label1      Right now I am listening to a great song. It is a song by PROPNAME PROPNAME called HUrrincane. I really like and it is a true story. PROPNAME PROPNAME is probably my favorite artist of all time. He is an amazing songwriter. And i love how he can play harmonica and guitar at the same time. I realize other people can probably do this but I just love to listen to PROPNAME PROPNAME. In this song Hurricane he tells the story of a boxer named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is framed for a crime he did not commit. His lyrics are really great because he plays with his rhyming and his rythm changes a lot too. I have seen PROPNAME PROPNAME perform in three different cities. The best one was in LOCNAME. I think LOCNAME is just a great city in general. That is one of the main reasons I wanted to go to ORGNAME. I really liked the idea of living in LOCNAME. And now that I am here it is working out really well. The school is huge but it is a very friendly, very beautiful campus. I am always surprised by how many people I run into in the course of a day. Sometimes I hadnt even known that the person went to Ut or even that they were in LOCNAME. Yesterday when I was eating I saw a guy that I had no seen since eighth grade. He recognized me right away and said his name so that I would remember him. It was amazing that he recognized me froms so long ago. I thought that was really cool. And I love UT because there are so many interesting classes to take. I never thought I would be able to take a whole class devoted to classical mythology. I have learned a little about mythology in other classes but now I have a whole class for it. It is really fun to read about all the deities and gods and demigods in different types of myths. My roommate right now has a sociology class about juvenile delinquency. I think that is also very interesting. She is reading her textbook right now. My roommate is cool. I got very lucky with the pot luck assignment. Shes from LOCNAME LOCNAME and her mom is a judge. Yesterday I met her mom and she is very nice too. She took us out to a really great Chinese restaraunt. It was one of my first non Jester meals since I've been here. I don't mind the food at Jester. Some people complain that Jester is gross but I really like it. The people on my floor are very friendly. Two girls across the hall always come over and hang out with us and its a lot of fun. I have lots of distractions from studying though so I have to be sure to try and concentrate and actually get my work done. There is just so much to do here. Tonight I am probably going to go to hear a singer play named PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is playing at LOCNAME. I have never been there but my brother tells me that it is cool. It is fun having an older brother go to the same school as you. He looks out for me. I sat with him at the footbasll gamme and it was really fun. I even got to go out on the field during halftime to help form the tunnel for the players. My very first UT game was a big success. The second half was very uneventful but overall I had a really good time. I don't usually watch a lot of football but I am excited about going to support the UT team. I even watched a girls soccer game the day after that. We beat ORGNAME 0-0. It was pretty fun to watch. I love to play soccer but I have not been on an organized team since my freshman year. In high school I mainly played softball. But now that I am at UT I don't play that anymore. I am going to sign up for intra mural volleyball and possibly flag football. My roommate and I are going to try to be on the same team. It should be a lot of fun. It is coed so we got some guys to join our team from down the hall. When I was in eighth grade I played volleyball and I was a setter. I think that will be my job on this team as well. My favorite sport to watch is baseball. I like to follow the ORGNAME ORGNAME. My dad is a big fan so he has had season tickets to the ORGNAME games for years. Now that there is a new stadium, our seats are really good. We sit right behind home plate and it is a great view of the game. Last time I watched one the ORGNAME won. They have changed a lot of stuff about ORGNAME baseball. They used to have cool rainbow uniforms and an alien guy for a mascot. But now the colors are navy blue and red or something like that. ANd the mascot is just some bunny thing. I like the old, vintage uniforms better. I wish I still had my old ORGNAME tshirts because it is very hard to find that stuff now. I had a big poster of Orbit the old mascot. 
__label__label1      The library is so boring. I can't stand more than two hours of library a day. Daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. It is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. There are too many distractions and I believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. ORGNAME is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, I divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that I have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. I wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, I mean location of the computer, I have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. I have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance I may be watched. I am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. It is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother 
__label__label0      my mom is so silly or mabey it is th eway I say them she just gets things wrong. But I love her and dad and sister they just anoy me.

I think htat I could have fun decorating an apartment tlike cute artsy. Flowers there would have to be dried flowers oh the rain PROPNAME enjoy ti so much she is crazy. The board is gettin g hard to touch I can not believe the time went by soooo fast call mom 
__label__label1 Well, let's see, what am I thinking and feeling?  My thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. I guess what's really on my mind is this PROPNAMEy and this week. It's been really, really stressful. The only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. The week did not start off well, as I lost a really cushy job, and it was just because I procrastanated and that made if even worse. Then, I got an interview, off campus 00 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and I had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so I was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where I was supposed to go and was freaking out. I could have cried. Right before I was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance I called back a lady that I had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. It  was my dream job but I was sure it would already be gone. Just my luck though, I impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and I got the job!  It was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. So things got better after that but today things were just shit. One of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. My other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. I cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and I hate drama. I guess I can't complain though, my job is great. I love working with art. The lady I'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. There were just a lot of jobs cut though and I feel really bad for her because I know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. But my other co-worker is really funny and I like her a lot but I'm really sad that she might be going away soon to LOCNAME, D. C. Everyone  else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. Let's see what else. Oh yeah, of course boy troubles. Boys suck, that's all there is to it. Sometimes, I wish they would all just die. Or at least those that suck. Not my friend da PROPNAME though. I love him. He e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :)  Also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. Know what I really need?  A break from all people. I just want to be alone. I want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. I want to go to a dig in LOCNAME and get away from everything. I hate feeling I owe something to other's feelings. I guess I'm just tired. The minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. I guess I'm just tired of that. It would just be great to start all over again, but I know that I can't regret the past and that I learn from everything I do. I have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, I mean I have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if I do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. In the end, I guess it's worth it because I know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. It's just what you have to put up with. I only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. Well, I'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but I'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :)

__label__label0      It amazes me that I have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet I wait to do it until the night before the deadline. I don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes I guess I do. I'm really tired. I stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. Then I had to wake up at about seven. I don't even know why I woke up that early. We entered the draw for the ORGNAME football tickets and everyone I talked to said to get there early. So I wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. I was pretty irritated when I found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. I must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. I guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. I'm actually not as nervous as I expected to be. I came from a town of 0000, smaller than most people's high schools. Everyone told me that I was going to be sad and cry a lot. Suprisingly I haven't been upset once. Sure I miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. I do miss my boyfriend. He's great. That was pretty hard. I cried more when I left him than my parents. Don't really know what that means. I was just use to seeing him everyday and now I hardly get to talk to him. He's still great though. I hope it all works out okay. I know it will. What's meant to be is meant to be though. I've sort of learned the hard way that I can't decide my own fate, I've tried to change things but they still end up the way I worried they would, but they ended up okay. I guess He does know what he's doing. He's pretty good at it. Yesterday was kind of hard. The September 00th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. I got to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME this summer. My mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. Pretty Nice gift. She and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. It was my middle sister PROPNAME's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. She was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. It was real sad, but we forced her to go. We had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. It was truly amazing.   In my dorm we have a connecting bath. It's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. It took my roomate and I a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. We've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. One of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom. Wierd, but I'm glad we figured it out, it was really starting to get on my nerves.   I've really been getting sick. I think I've been sick since I moved down here. I'm sure it's because I'm in a new setting and I don't sleep near as much as I should, but I guess I'll adjust. I called my doctor and he told me I needed ORGNAME ORGNAME, which wouldn't get me well but it would make me   feel better  , and some sleep. It's hard because I still use my old doctor. He's the only doctor I've ever had. I guess it's that comfort zone thing again. I've lived in the same town, on the same street, with the same neighbors, in the same house. I've had the same friends for eighteen years. It's sort of odd to be gone from everything.    The coolest thing happened to me this past weekend. My boyfriend got me tickets to go to PROPNAME PROPNAME so I went home. There was a   get together   before the concert so we went over to one of his friend's house. As I was walking in, this girl was coming out, she just looked at me and smiled, so naturally I smiled back. Then she said,   are you PROPNAME PROPNAME?   I was like Yeah. She looked at me and said,   I'm Crystal.  I was thinking okay?? then she said   your best friend.  She was my best friend from Kindergarten to Second grade. She had to move to LOCNAME with her family. Then she moved to a little town, lifeguarded in another town where she met her boy friend PROPNAME, who happens to be one of my friends cousins. It's such a small world. PROPNAME and PROPNAME hang out so he has known her for a while. It's so exciting. 
__label__label1 As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 0 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. LOCNAME is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 0/00/00, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 0 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 00. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 00 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the LOCNAME LOCNAME will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.  
__label__label1    I'm not really sure what exactly I'm supposed to do with this. There is some guy in my room that keeps trying to talk to me and I don't know him. I wonder why he's in here. Theres a really old song playing on the radio. I havent heard it in a while. it reminds me of 0th grade. Every song does that, takes me back to a different place in time. Now this song reminds me of my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder what they're doing right now. I miss my old friends. I'm really excited about this weekend. LOCNAME is going to be a blast. I just hope that everything works out. I really want to suprise PROPNAME, but if I have to tell him I'm coming I guess I will. I really don't want to. That guy won't shut up. I'm thinking I might just take a cab from the airport to the university. My dad said theres a tropical storm. I sure hope it disentigrates before I get there. I hope everything works out with PROPNAME, though. I think this weekend is going to be the deciding factor of our relationship. Things are so tense every time we talk. I want to go back to that last night at his house. . it was so amazing. We stayed up the enitre night watching the meteor shower and talking out on his balcony. one of those moments I will never forget even when I'm old. I wonder what I will be like when I'm old. I want to be a cool grandma. I want to live in a big old house on some land but drive a really badass car and cook good food for m grandkids and spoil them. I guess b efore I  have grandkids, I have to have kids. which I don't want to do. I was watching the learning channel and MAN having those babies has to hurt. I could just have a c section. Thats what my aunt did. But then she died of cancer. Maybe I shouldnt have one. This cough is getting really old. I always get colds. Last time I had one was before me and John met though. HE brought me flowers for the first time. White dasies on the red tahoe outside of my room. I miss that. The note said he didnt have any soup. flowers would have to do. I love that. If I could right now, i would fly to miami and marry this boy. i remember the day my sister got married. It was the most beautiful thing i've seen. OF COURSE I WOULD DO IT DIFFERNETLY IF IT WAS MY WEDDING&gt; OK NOW MY COMPUTER IS FREAKING OUT&gt; UMMM I don't KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IT won't QUIT! OK THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER ME SO MUCH&gt; I HATE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU don't KNOW HOW TO FIX IT&gt; SOMETIMES THESE THINGS ARE JUST TOO SMART FOR THEIR OWN GOOD&gt; MY EYE ITCHES BUT I can't ITCH IT&gt; WIERD&gt; I WONDER WHY YOU can't ITCH INSIDE&lt; BUT IT ITCHES ANYWAYS&gt; HMM&gt; I WONDER WHY YOUR FOOT WILL JUST FALL ASLEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN AND YOU can't WAKE IT UP&gt; WHY DO THEY SAY IT FELL ASLEEP? IT SMELLS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER IN MY ROOM BECAUSE MY ROOMATE IS MAKING A PB&J SANDWICH&gt; I  M HUNGRY NOW TOO&gt; I COULDNT EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN EARLIER BECAUSE I WAS COUGHING TOO MUCH&lt; BUT NOW ITS A LITTLE BETTER&gt; I SHOULD TRY TO EAT SOMETHING&gt; I WISH THERE WAS JUST A PILL THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT WOULD BE FOOD&gt; IT WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL THING&gt; FOOD TAKES UP SO MUCH OF OUR TIME AND LIVES&gt; WE WOULD LIVE CHEAPER&lt; HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS&lt; AND PROBALY WOULDNT HAVE SO MANY OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE&gt; THATS A GOOD IDEA&gt; I THINK IM GOING TO COME UP WITH ONE OF THOSE&gt;&gt;&gt; 
__label__label0 Well to me PROPNAME will be writting for a solid twenty minutews so I guess I will talk about a very cool event that has just befallen me in the past few day. Early this summer I recived the new student directory, a directory that shows the pictures and intresets of the new incomming class. Well, when I first got the directory my sister who is nine looked at it first. When I finally got a chance to see it I noticed my sister had left me a note that said,    Girl you are going to marry page 00 nPROPNAMEed PROPNAME PROPNAME.  I looked att the picture of the girl smiled at my sisters innocent joy and put the dirctory on my shelf, and thought nothing more of the girl. THen on Wendsday of this past week I see this knock out walking down the escaltor. I was walking with some friends and in an effort to get a better look at this beautiful girl I told my friends to go ahead. So I tried to make myself, not that anyone noticed. ok pause I have killed like five ants while I have been writign this thing. any way I tried to make myself look like I was doing something until she neard the door. I then reached out and conviently opened the door for her. She said,    Thank you,   and nothing more but I felt great! Well as I wathced her walk away I felt something in my gut tell me to go up and say hi or something of that nature. Well, I am fairly confident person and I have been known on occasion to go tell girls I thought were very pretty, just that, that they were pretty. I don't really know why I say these things sometimes it just makes me feel better that I told them they are pretty. Ok number six just got it. Ok so I have this gut feeling to go up and tell her I think she is beautiful. So I run up to where she is walking,and I kind of get infront of her and say,   PROPNAME, I just wanted to tell you I think you are really pretty. Thats all thats all I wanted to tell you.  She says thank you and kind of smiles. It must be wierd for her to have some random guy just come up and tell her that, but I just kind of needed to. Well now for the cool as heck part. I reach out my hand to introduce myself,   Hi my name is PROPNAME,   and She says   Hi I am PROPNAME.    What is your last name?   I asked and she says   PROPNAME.  Well at this point I don't know if you can scroll back up to the begining of my story but, this is the same girl my nine year old sister picked out for me to marry! I couldn't believe it! Our conversation kind of ended there I said I would see her arounf and she said good bye. . I am almost out of time but I ended up talking to her on Friday and we are going to go out sometime this week. I couldn't believe how strange this whole thing played out but, I know I have prayed about it and I am just going to keep trying find teh right path and who knows, it might be something amazing.         
__label__label0       I am so glad that I am finished with that stupid test for psy. Now when I finish this I can take a nap. I need to do laundry and get ready for tonight. I need to get the money that PROPNAME and PROPNAME owe me to do the laundry. I am not sure what I am going to wear tonight. I am tired. I hope that we get tickets to the OU football game, I really don't want to go stand in line and wait though. I hope that PROPNAME and PROPNAME will not be mad because I didn't get the tickets. I like Adam a lot. He is a really cool guy and I am really glad that we are friends. I like to have close guy friends. PROPNAME is cool too. although I have to admit that I found him attractive at first. He isn't hot or anything, but it is something about his personality. I know that he has a girlfriend, but I have PROPNAME too. I love PROPNAME and I wouldn't mess anything up with him for PROPNAME. I don't like him that much. My arms really hurt from being on the computer so much. My whole body hurts from exersizing so much latly. I want to loose weight so badly. I wonder how this will be graded, I don't suppose that there is a right or wrong answer, but what if I am writing about the wrong thing. I think I over think things. I wish PROPNAME was here. You know I think that, but I am really not sure if he was here I would like it. I mean there is a certian degree of independence without anyone here. I think that everyone follows their path diferently than others.  I mean PROPNAME is getting married. I know that I don't want to get married, but do I really want to stay with PROPNAME forever. I think so, but it just baffles me how I know that circumstances were different with me then I would be in a sorority and would go out and party a lot. Maybe it is good for me to not to have some of the luxuries that others have and it will let me make better decisions. I just don't understand why money makes a person. Maybe this is really steriotipical, but I think if you have money you can do a lot of the things that poorer people couldn't do. That sucks. I thought that all people are equal and God gave us all differnt abilities and in the end we are not all alike, but rich in differnt areas of our life. The more that I think about it though I am not sure that is the case. I mean maybe it is true and life isn't fair!  That would suck too by the way. I personally think that some of my frinds grew up better that me and therefore they will turn out better than me. PROPNAME is very introverted and wants to go home. that is one thing that I have over her. I don't want to go back to LOCNAME. I see PROPNAME as a second chance for me and I will break out of the social barrier that I had at home. I mean don't get me wrong, I had good parents that loved me and always gave me the best they could, but my mom wasn't as involved as others were and I think that hurt me socially in highschool. I wasn't in the popular crowd and I am not sure if I want to be. 
__label__label1 the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       
__label__label1     Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 0th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 00 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 0 0/0 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 00-00 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. 
__label__label1      I FEEL REALLY TIRED NOW. I JUST COMPLETED MY PRE TESTING NOW,. THE TIME IS SO LATE NOW, I WONDER IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK TODAY. THERE IS NOBODY IN THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY. I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A HEADACHE. I HAVE SO MANY STUDYING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. I HAVE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK TO DEAL WITH, MY CALCULUS 0 HOMEWORK TO WORK OUT, MY BIOCHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO. GEES THAT SOUDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT TO DO. TODAY HAS BEING HELL FOR ME. TO START OFF, I LOST MY CREDIT CARD. I WISH I WAS AT HOME RIGHT NOW. I COULD WEAR I SMELL SOETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I WONDER WHAT MY SISTERS ARE DOING NOW. I AM SURE THEY WANT ME HOME. BHUT I HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE STUDYING. I HAVE TO DO EXCELLENTLY WELL THIS SEMESTER, TO BRING UP MY GPA AVERAGE. SO FAR I THINK MY CALCULUS CLASS IS GOING ON FINE. My PHYSICS CLASS IS ALSO GOING ON FINE. I WONDER HOW MY LAB WOULD BE LIKE. I HOPE I DO VERY WELL IN THE CLASS. I JUST HAVE FAITH THAT THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I KNOW IT IS. I AM GOING TO TRY AND DO MY BEST. I NEED A GIRL IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER GET A GIRL, WHEN I AM JUST TO PICKY. WHY NOSA WHY?I JUST CAN HELP THE WAY I FEEL. I MEAN IT IS ME, I CAN'T HELP IT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL, NOT A SUPERFICIAL GIRL, NOT A FAKE GIRL, A REAL, BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY GIRL. SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, SOMEBODY THAT COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM. SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MORE THANANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SOMEONE THAT WOULD DIE FOR ME. SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GROW OLD WITH ME AND STILL LOVE ME THEN. IF I COULD JUST FIND THAT SPECIAL PERSON, I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN OF ALL. IS IT TOO MUSH TO ASK FOR. I MEAN I AM A GOOG LOOKING GUY AND QUITE A NICE GUY TOO. WHAT MORE COULD A WOMAN NEED. I AM SWEET. SWEET AS AN APPLE PIE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR ME. MY SOUL IS SEARCHING TO FIND YOU. I JUST HOPE HER SOUL IS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WELL BACK TO REALITY. STUDYING. I GOT TO GO STUDY. I FEEL HUNGRY AND SLEEPY. 
__label__label0 I needed to do something other than re-write re-writing a paper for   my freshman seminar. Yes, although the new IMac was the   #0   computer for college students,   it has already failed me twice. I   wrote the first copy of my paper yesterday, this morning I dragged   myself in after a long Saturday night to continue where I left off. The   screen was frozen, and my half-way written paper was beyond the   reachable distance between me and my computer screen. My words   are lost in the motherboard of this machine. And then it happened   again. I rewrote the paper, without a harsh-word. In fact, my second   copy was much more to my liking. It made more sense and fit   together. And then I wondered how long my paper was. I have this   tendancy to write in extra small font and single spacing so I'll   surprize myself at how much I've written when i allow myself the   viewing pleasure. When I hit the   paragraph   button, the   application   unexpectedly quit.  This time I allowed myself a splur of profanity   and allowed myself to make a few phone calls, since I'd had such   bad luck I might as well run the long-distance up as well. But since   no one wanted to talk to me, I turned back to the Imac. Not for my   damn paper on the film Matewan again. No, not yet. But for my psych   paper. With my luck this paper will also get lost in the matrix of the   unknown. Those unimaginable invisble power lines, where my   thoughts, words, and fonts flow to any other computer connected to   this wired (and now wireless) world. Now I'm all caught up in these   thoughts about the   deep unknown.  I've confused myself, my study   of psychology and science isn't deep enough for thoughts that   sometimes cross my mind. I should stick to the petty crush I have on   my RA and practicing for my dance tryout tonight. While psychology   is something that really does interest me, I'm not sure why. It's   classified as a science. The science of the mind, I've done my   readings. But I hate science. I hate math. In fact they're my worst   nightmare. Numbers and equations jumble up in my head and I   don't really care about the anatomy of ants or why the sun is so   bright. It just is. I can settle for that. Asking something any deeper is   frightening. No, it's not my   thing.  My thing? That would be visual   performance and art. Specifically, design. The word excites me.  Creation and design could be seen as similar. One could be a   science and one and art, or one in the same. But the science aspect   doesn't thrill me. It's the art. The color and the comfort. I love to   watch, to look, and to experience. Not to calculate. Maybe it's   shallow-that I won't to the shit work. But what's shit work to me is a   dream come true to another. My time runs out and my mind races   too fast to type my thoughts. If my writing is as confusing as it's   made me feel, I blame it on the techno music that my roommate is   blaring. Maybe the IMac doesn't like the music.   
__label__label1 I am at work right now. I guess I'm a little hesitant about writing this   stream of consciousness, because we never do this in school.   We're always asked to write on a specific topic or something of that   sort, and to write what we think is such a broad topic. I'm sick, and I   don't think its because of those freshman jitters you were talking   about. I was completely confident in going to school. Nonetheless, I   got sick. . my parents say its because I don't have enough sleep or   because the dorms have diseases. I don't live in the dorm, though,   which is both a plus and a bad thing. I like living off campus,   because it feels more homey and seems like there's a place to get   away from school. Then again, a lot of my friends live on campus so   I don't necessarily get to hang out with them a lot. Its ok though,   because they always try to include me. Yesterday, I studied at ORGNAME   until midnight and my friend was so worried about me walking home   alone that she made these two guys walk home with us. I have bad   congestion and my mind seems like its under a lot of pressure, so if   I don't make sense, that is probably why. I'm listening to music   which seems kind of girly and I feel that the guy I work with might   think it is too, but he hasn't said anything. No matter what I do, I like   to have music on. when I sleep, when I study. Its a habit, I guess.   The main thing I have on my mind is successively passing my   classes. I have no doubt that I will pass. . but passing with A's is   another thing. I  am one of those girls who went through all 00 years   of basic schooling with all A's, and have never had a problem with   being behind in class or even worrying about getting a B. It might   seem like the work of a perfectionist, but  I wasn't always the most   studious. I'm quite the procrastinator. Ever since I started college,   however, it seems like I've had quite an interest in my classes and   studying. Of course, there's the occasional partying, but it seems   like college is an experience to do what you want to do. I like to   study and learn and feel as if I've accomplished something on my   own will. Its like reading. When I was little, I used to read a lot!  As   school started, they always made us read books, so I lost interest in   the joy of reading willingly. This past summer, I read Uncle PROPNAME's   Cabin and it was wonderful. It was probably the first book I read on   my own for awhile. When there's studying to do, and organizations   to participate in, there's no time for leisure time like reading or   watching TV. That is one thing I'm proud of since I've gotten here. I   haven't watched much TV. I wish I was more of a news-person, but   the news just doesn't catch my interest all that much. Its like   everyday there's another child missing or a new statistic that   everyone is obese. I guess shows like Dateline or 00/00 that show   the in-depth look at stories are more my style. We were told a story   in Mythology about how   people   used to have four legs and four   arms and two heads, and it was like they were connected by their   backs. Well, these 'people' became overly arrogant and so the gods   decided to split the two in half so there would be more of them and   they would be more efficient, and they wouldn't gloat so much. Then   they scattered the halves all around the world, and that is why we go   around searching for our other half. I like this story so much   because I'm a romantic. Hopeless romantic is more the term I   would use to describe myself. Even though I've been wonderfully   single for 00 years. . there's this hope that there will be a special   someone I will have sparks with and this higher connection to. I   don't know if I've watched too many movies or have too many   daydreams, but I guess I'm like most girls searching for their prince   charming. Sometimes I look into the atrological signs, of which I am   a Virgo. It usually always says that Virgos get bored quickly. I think   that in a way, I am that way. Its horrible to say, but I think I'll tire of   someone quickly if they don't keep my interest. Of course, I like to   keep everyone as friends, but romantically speaking, there has to be   something different about a person. There's a song by ORGNAME that   goes, 'I want to be like those girls in the movies, have a guy fall   hopelessly in love with me. '  Now, that seems kind of selfish, but to   know that a guy really cares about you and would sacrifice many   things for you is a really different characteristic. Guys nowadays are   so un-chivalrous. I feel like a little boy-crazy girl right now, but my   friend had mentioned that I should talk about this in my writing and I   guess it kind of stuck. Fortunately, I'm completely content with my   life and I feel that I have a lot going for me. I am not at all ashamed   of being single, but there's always those people who ask why there's   no guy in my life. What do I say to them?  I love being single.   There's those girls who go blind by love, and I hope to never lose   myself in the process of loving someone else. Its crazy.   
__label__label0      i can't seem to picture anything but just seem to think of silence and the color white. It also seems to help me think of me sort of like a simple person and how my mind is thinking of my personallity and the color white as if i am a boring person. Then i think that it is not the color that best represents me because i really believe i am outgoing and that the color white is dull and really not me. I seem to be distracted by the air condition in my apartment as if everything i am thinking is interupted my the noise of the air. Blue pops into my head sort of associating the air with the color blue but now it seems as if that is impossible because you can't see air then why would i associate it with the color blue, maybe because it is the color that artists have used in the past to associate wind with. Now i have a song by Puff Daddy in my head and all i know is that i repeat inside my head  the same verse   as long as we're here we might as well shine together   i wonder if they are actually his words because before he has been accused of copying words from other artists. Yet it is surprising that i am writing so much and not complaining, maybe because everything is just poping into my head this is different i usually don't think of anything. now i am thinking i don't pay enough attention to myself enough as if i ignore what my minds says. If once i could actually stop and think what my mind says like i am doing right now maybe i would be a better person and i wouldn't be in the position i am put in all the time and maybe just maybe i would'nt be in trouble all the time. now that i say trouble i think of my girlfriend and start to wonder what she is doing and maybe what she is thinkning. isn't it weird how we rather see what otherpeople are thinking rather than seeing what you yourself is thinking. i just thought that was weird but true. now i wonder what all this means all these mixed thoughts without no real sense in them. how can a test be made to tell me what or how i think that's weird. but then again that is the 00 century for you staring right at your face. Were there tests that could tell you how you thought 000 years from now or is this just something recent. that last sentence seems stupid like if i were asking the air and waiting for a response. it is raining outside and it is the first time i see rain in Austin because i am not from around here it is amazing how the sound of the rain makes me want to sleep but now after so long i found out that rain or the weather does not affect a persons mood. thats weird if there were anything that i was certain in psychology was that it did affect your mood or the way a person felt. just now i wonderd why do they say that if there is an eclipse it is bad for a preganant women. Just out of now where i thought that. Is it bad? wait a minute who am i asking thats weird how i still want to know something and rather than asking someone who might know something about the subject i rather ask myself to see i really can not come up with an answer. I wonder where my parents are if they are at work or if they are at home and if it is raining there too like it is here or my brothers where are they who knows we hardly see eachother anyways so it is as if i were home 
__label__label0 It's three thirty in the afternoon right now, and i'm working on my psychology homework. this is a very interesting assignment; i've never done one quite like this. it's actually quite easy--just putting my thoughts on this site and having it timed. quite fascinating. i'm excited today because i finally got my internet and cable installed!! it's been almost 0 weeks since i've been able to watch tv on my own and to use my own internet to get online!! i don't know how i made it, but i'm still alive. hehe. i'm glad that the time-warner people finally got the address right. the first time they came, the went to the wrong apartment complex!! how aggravating!! i've never been more miserable in my entire life!! but today, i'm feeling competely opposite!! ahh. the joys of modern technology. right now, my desk is hurting my arms. since i'm typing, the fleshy part of my arm is getting pushed into the edge of the desk, thus creating a groove in my skin which is sometimes painful. other than that, i'm ok. oh, but my chair is also making impressions on the back of my leg. i'm wearing shorts now so the back of my legs have a cloth pattern on them. my computer is working fine right now, which i am very grateful for. my friend stephen just instant messenged me, but i can't really reply back to him right now since i am doing this writing assignment, which is timed. i feel like i am writing a lot, but perhaps it is because i type fast. hmm. could be. well, i seem to be making many typos. i guess i should slow down and think of what i am writing before i write it. i sometimes get ahead of myself when i am thinking of what to write and it wreaks havoc on my typing. twenty minutes is a long time if you think about it. i mean, i've typed all of this in just seven minutes and twenty three seconds. i'm also trying to figure out which of my friends i should call to help me with the downloading of music. it's the greatest thing on the internet, but somehow i can't get it to work as efficiently as they can. all they have to do to play a song is click the list of songs that they have on the side of their screen, but when i want to play a song, i have to pull up a separate folder. bleh!! so i need to call one of my friends. but who should i call?? let's see. there's stephen, who im'ed me, rex, maria, sarika (she's going home this weekend though), mitra, lindsay (or is it -ey?), maria, her boyfriend zack, her boyfriend's friend stephen, ha, tahera, or jessica. i'm sure i know more people, but i can't think of them right now. the sad thing with the people i just listed is that almost all of them went to the same high school as i did. i need to meet new people. i can't hang out with the same few people every single day. but it's so hard to meet people when the classes have hundreds of people in them each. i go to class sitting next to a different person every single time. i rarely see the same person in my classes. i guess that's what i get for taking all the introductory classes. this stream of consciousness thing is cool. i'm thinking about my syntax (haha. such an ap english 0 word) and it's weird. i never normally talk like this. i feel as though i am babbling to myself or trying to sound intelligent as i babble. i guess i don't talk in an ignorant way, but i feel as though i sound more sophisticated than i really sound in real life. so i might go see a movie with my friends next friday entitled   one hour photo.   the ever so famous robin williams is in the movie, along with the very appealing guy from the hit show alias, michael vartan. the show alias is really cool--this girl named sydney, played by jennifer garner, is this spy/counterspy and she does all this cool stuff with all her high tech gadgets. and michael vartan plays her handler. now i'm talking on the phone with my friend maria. she called about what we want to do tonight. so we might play monopoly. apparently rex brought monopoly. or maybe it's rex who has it. i don't know. all i know is that now i have to call rex and see if he wants to play monolopy after his chinese bible study thing. i went to this chinese/taiwanese association thing the other night, and i felt so white-washed. that means that i don't feel like i'm as asian as them. i guess that could be a bad thing, but it probably was because half of those people were fobbish. fobbish means that they just got to the states so they're still really foreign-like. it kind of makes them stand out, but if they're ok with it, then it doesn't matter. i'm almost finished!! woohoo!! now i have to go call rex and see what we're doing tonight. good bye! 
__label__label1      Holy crap I should hurry and type. This is going to be a long time. I am already bored. Why do I have to do this. My wrist hurts typing like this. What is this going to prove. Ouch. my leg itches. So does my neck but I can't stop typing because if i do then this will be a complete failure i wonder what is on tv  my back itches i hope i don't smell bad should i be using punctuation oh well guess i won't this is really long i can't believe i have to do this i wonder how fast i can type i wish that i could watch tv later on im going to go and get something to eat what should that be i don't kow i think that i will have pizza more than likely that sounds good i need to use the restroom something smells good it smells like popcorn i wonder if there is a movie on i like watching movies remember that on time when i was at this movie with my friends and during the middle of the movie he said   this game is over   it was so funny i want to watch some cartoons like the transformers i wonder why that show is not on anymore i mean it was like my favorite show ever. my neighbor is blasting some excellent music. It sounds like it is punk which i enjoy very much. i want to stop typeing sargent door locks i want some milk i haven't had a good glass of whole milk since i have been here. All there is is 0% 0% or skim and those are all really gross. i can't see how anyone would drink that it is like watered down milk. but i guess not to many people really drink that. yes only 00 mins left for me to type. my hands are getting tired. it is quite cool in my room i wish that i was in jester and not in moore hill all my friends are in jester and that makes me feel bad that i don't get to see themall the time hey jerk face turn your music down it is making my stuff move on my desk. i hope that changing things into paragraphs is not required becaue if that is then i will probably fail but then again this just to written in a stream of total conscienceness so i guess that i don't really even need to stop to put periods in do i i need to take a nap this is really hard because i don't know if i am really even typing what i am think at least i don't have to worry about my laundry it was done yesterday. i can't believe how bad our team played on saturday we didn't even score in the second half that is pathetic why must this be happening i need to go potty but i can't because of this stupid paper ya know what cartoons are an excellent choice to watch i mean like aqua teen hunger force that show makes me laugh so hard i need to download some of those and the show undergrads that was excellent to bad it was taken off the air. i wonder how much useless trivia i know i bet it is a lot but when it comes to actual knowledge i don't really know that much i wonder why that is. i need to go swimming i like swimming how the water feels nice and cold it makes you go faster than warm water i wonder if i can swim at the joe jamail swim center how much more do i have to type shut that music off it is driving me crazy complete silence in my room is no fun hey gabriel turn on the tv so that then i can at least watch something while i type that would be a good think i wonder what those marks on my closet door is from i bet i have horrible grammar but excellent typeing speed that is all you really need. i hope that i get a good grade on this paper and that all of this was worth my time okay only four minutes left come on kevin keep it together you can make it through this i wonder how much i have typed because if it is a lot that would be really surprising i am so happy that this is almost over because i don't think that i could have taken this i wonder who just got on IM because that would be better than this i really need to do some studying i hope that the next paper is a lot better than this one because i hate just writing about what i am feeling are thinking because it feels so forced and like i don't ha ha that jerk next door has just left excellent oh well back to talking about useless trivia i bet that you couldn't name all the states in 00 mins it is really hard only me and my best friend reed have been able to do it and it took me 0 mins and him 0 and a half no one else i have challenge has been able to do it it makes you want to shoot yourself in t 
__label__label1      Stream of Conciousness. hmmm. My mind is clearest when it's late, music in the background is soothing, it makes me think of PROPNAME. The music playing is PROPNAME's favorite. It's amazing that one person can be such a pillar of strength. One person can change so much, by doing so little. Strength, Independance, Perserverance, Beauty, ORGNAME, Love, ORGNAME, these are things that everyone wants, we all want to be everything, and the best of it all. Not even that we want to be everything, but we want to be precieved as everything. People in high school who were everything were really nothing. In life people who think they're everything are usually nothing. I want to be something. I feel really small, i'm waiting to feel big. Not physcially, but emotionally, big. I'm not fragile, but I'm not that pilar of strength yet. this isn't home yet. My bed isn't home yet. With time it will be home. When I walk in the door it feels like home, but every morning when i wake up, it's not quite right. It gets more right every day. Dashboard Confessionals, listening to them makes me feel comfortable, just quiet enough to hear, but not load enough to understand. So much to do, lists and lists. Why is it I procrastine always, always. Study habits are so bad, mom was right. I hate it when mom is right. Why do I always yell at her in my dreams? Dreams are always there, emotions are always there, I can't hide them in dreams. Rain is wonderful, it makes me breathe lighter. I love sleeping when its raining on the window, that was nice today. Sitting on my bed letting the skys fall. This life isn't a dress rehearsal, that is a poster on my wall. I'm never going to get a second chance, this is all i've got, never again will this moment happen, and look, i'm spending this moment typing like a crazy person trying to fill up this twenty minutes. I never realized how long twenty minutes can really be. The sound of the shower is a lot like the sound of rain, i like it. I like the smell of our room after someone is done showering, it's clean, fresh, it makes me smile. why are pictures so important? I have every important thing captured into pictures, who cares if you're really happy, when the camera comes, the smile appears, wheater you want it to or not. It's like when I dance, you walk on the stage and I become a totally different person, its not me. Dance is wonderfully curel. Twisting, torking, pain, stretching, then you walk on the stage and slap on a smile, like it feels good, pretending or lying? hmmmm. . something to ponder. My biology book keeps staring at me, screaming YOU HAVE TO READ ME SOMETIME! and God, is it right, i've got to. Dedication, it's what got me here, and it's the only thing that's going to get me out within the next four to five years. Biology - how could that motivate anyone?!?! The only thing that motivates me is dance, sad, but true. What would i be doing without dance? Living on the street corners of LOCNAME? I would if it made me happy - poor, rich, whatever, happy. Happy is what i want. 00 minutes is up - stream of conciousness. . hmmmm. . 
__label__label1      well here i am, just sitting and typing. I've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - I've got class til 0, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week!  hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me?  thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 0 (or 0?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 00 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big L-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that PROPNAME (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong!  maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that I've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 0) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 0) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 0 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 0) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 0 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she HAS her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows!  im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never 
__label__label1 Just like everyone else's writings, I'm sure starting off with I don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like "king kong" or "umbrellas". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the "hobbitt" project and austin named one of the characters "dildo daggins". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say "dildo" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn't in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 0 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying "firewall alert" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause I don't like computers to begin with and I can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 0 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said "is that thing STILL beeping?" and she told me it had been beeping for 0 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 00 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don't know where my roommate is, she left at 0:00 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 0 but she is still not back and it's almost 0. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don't have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it's a standard and I'm not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, PROPNAME (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in LOCNAME this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $00! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can't wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I'd get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in LOCNAME from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in LOCNAME a youth group of about 00 came up from LOCNAME. I really miss LOCNAME- I can't wait to go back, even though I don't speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from LOCNAME, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time's almost up- I really didn't think I'd be able to type and think for 00 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye! 
__label__label0 Well now I'm starting my writing assignment for psychology. Great, just another thing that's keeping me from doing everything else I have to do. I still have another chapter I have to read for biology, but I guess I can do that after calculus tomorrow, I'll have a good hour to get that in. And I'm sure professor weiss will end up assigning another chapter or two for the afternoon class. Is that my cell phone?  No, I thought I turned it off. Ya its off, it must have been my roommate's cell phone. Man the awkward silence in this dorm room is deafening. I really wish I would have just sprung for the single room. But no, mom said that wouldn't give me the ?college experience?. blah blah blah. All the experience I'm getting out of this is to avoid being in the dorm room. My light bulb on this lamp I bought isn't very good, it does not give off much light, but when you turn it a certain way you start to go blind, it just does not make any sense. And I don't know who the architect was behind putting these dang bookshelves in Jester. There is not enough room for my computer monitor to be pushed to the back of my desk. and I have a flat panel monitor so that is saying something. I mean I have no space for my books, spirals, paper or anything with the addition of my keyboard and mouse. Its just ridiculous. Even if computers hadn't been invented way back when this place was built, it still makes no logical sense to have the book case as low as it is without completely attaching it to the desk. I mean, they might as well have just added 0 more shelves to the darn thing and called it quits. Nothing could fit back there, its just aggravating. Wow its only been 0. 0 minutes, I've got a long ways to go. I have to do my calculus homework after this, I hope that goes well. The last thing I need is to stress out over some retarded math problem and end up having it been typed wrong so there is no solution and you spend your entire night trying to figure it out when there is no solution available in the choices that logically fits into the problem. That is the thing I hate about multiple choice math problems, anybody can leave off a negative sign and leave you chasing your tail forever. I really wish I would have just waited to take m000l, I already had C out of the way, but I didn't want to wait and have all the stuff I learned in high school leave my brain and be totally lost when it came time to take the class. Plus I kind of like the mathematical stimulation, its totally different than any other kind of study. When you understand a math concept, you really feel accomplished with yourself. At least I do, I'm probably the only person on this campus that feels that way. well on the other hand, there are math majors, so I guess I'm one of few. Great only 0. 0 minutes to go. I guess the good thing about this assignment is that you can't really run out of things to write about, you just keep typing whatever your thinking, even if tends to weigh on the pointlessness of this assignment, its still something to write about, after all I'm thinking about it aren't I?  I still have not even read my psychology chapter. I wonder if that is even necessary, every other bit of reading I have done in my classes has been a waste. Well not a waste I guess, I am learning something about the material and to discipline myself to do the work. I really miss my best friends back home. They both went to LOCNAME campuses at home. LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I'm kind of glad to be here at UT LOCNAME since we obviously have the more qualified professors and all, but man I'm just depressed without my friends. I'm not very good at making new ones, it takes me a while to warm up to people. After all, it took me 0 years to become friends with my 0 best friends. Everything else just seemed like an acquaintance compared to them. They really are great. I just wish the felt the same about me, but I'm sure they don't. I'm always the one that over appreciates things. I guess that is why my friendships didn't really mean much, because I made everyone tired of it, I don't know maybe that is just total crap I made up. I tend to justify things too much when I should just let them go. I can't believe I have to sit through 0 sessions of biology tomorrow. If they were going to combine the course, they could at least make it be on different days. But no, they have to make it back to back, well not really back to back there is a 0 hour interim between the 0 classes. At least its time to catch up on my reading that I'll no doubt be behind on in a matter of days at this rate. I'm really enjoying chemistry though. Doctor Laude is awesome. I just hope I do well in his class, I hate liking teachers and then doing poorly in their class. Actually that is never happened to me before, I've always done well in classes that I liked. I don't know why people become teachers if they don't want to help students. Go flip burgers somewhere if you don't care, that way we'd only have teacher that cared and wanted to help us learn and graduate. It seems like all my professors will be like that this year. Except professor PROPNAME, he can barely speak english, I don't know how he is going to be over the next semester. So far he is been ok, I guess. He gets off on tangents when he can't think of what he wants to say. 
__label__label1 I hope that this 00 minutes goes by fast because I hate typing and Big Brother 0 is on in the living room and I can hear it but I can't see it. My leg itches and now so does my shoulder. It's funny how when you think about something itching then lots of parts of your body start to itch. I have an economics quiz tomorrow that I still have to study for. Maybe I will ask PROPNAME to get me ready for it. It's my first one in college so I don't know what to expect. So 00 minutes is a long time because I am out of things to say and it has only been 0 minutes. My lips are kind of chapped but I don't feel like getting up to get the chapstick form the bathroom. My head itches a lot today. I think it must be from the weather. Now my arm hurts my holding it up to type since The Towers does not give us a place to put our keyboards so they have to sit up high on the desk. I have such bad posture when I type. I slouch over a lot which makes my upper back sore. I don't know if I can go for 00 minutes without going through some intense pain. It has been almost 00 hours since I have talked to my mom. She must think that I have been abducted. I will call her after this long assignment. I wish someone would call me because I am so bored and it is the first night that I have stayed home alone. But I have had a lot of homework so it is good that I have been home to get it done. I need to give myself a pedicure when I go home this weekend. my toenails are getting really long. I think I will go to the high school football game on Friday if my brother goes but I am sure he will since the love of his life is on the dance team. My teeth feel really grungy. I guess I didn't brush them after I got back from dinner. But man was dinner good. I love beef chalupas but I love them more when my mom makes them and puts guacamole on them. I emailed a lot of people yesterday and I wonder if they have emailed me back. Probably not since everyone is busy with the start of school but oh well. Man it is really cold in here. If I turn up the air then it just gets too hot and I would rather be too cold than too hot. Except for in the mornings when I step out into the hall to go to class. it is freezing out there and then it is really warm in the elevators. This place has really bad temperature control. I have not gotten any mail so far. it would be nice to know that people still love me and miss me. They are about to announce the veto on BB0 so I am listening in to see what PROPNAME is doing. She is giving a whole life story up there and she used the veto on herself which is smart. Anyways I still have 0 minutes left. This has goe by pretty fast but now my wrists are hurting a little. Maybe I am developing carpultunel (sp?) syndrome. That can't be good. I miss my dogs a lot. They were so cute when I went home this weekend. I miss sleeping with Pita. my bed is so lonely without her. Maybe I should get a guy to replace her. That sounds like a good idea. I can't wait until the new and last season of Friends starts in late September. I am going to cry at the season finale. My roommate just said how happy she is that she didn't take this class because this assignment although not mentally hard is quite physically hard. Only 0. 0 minutes left. Oh happy day. I wonder if any of my friends are online so that I can talk to them when I am done with this. My bracelets are starting to dig into my wrist since I am putting pressure on them to type. I need to get some more stuff to decorate my room. It looks so plain compared to my friends' room but their room has too much stuff in it. My time is almost up now. I only have thirty seconds left. Man that really did go by now that I think about it. I hope we don't have any more assignments like this one. My hands hurt!   
__label__label0 As I sit here in my dorm room, I am really tired, probably because I stayed up late doing homework last night. My body feels sore but I like to workout so that doesn't really bother me much. I can not really concentrate right now, but that is probably because I just woke up and I still feel half asleep. I feel very stressed out right now because I have a chemistry exam on friday and I need to read to the chapters. I guess I should not have procrastinated, but I do that a lot. My roommate is actually going to class for once, and I am very happy for her. Hurray! I thought this assignment was going to be a lot easier than it is, but I guess not. I am really thirsty right now. My hair has gotten really long, and I am very happy about that because I cut it all off recently but it is growing back. My knee really hurts because I am out in the hot sun, but then go in the freezing classroom, so whenever there is a temperature change my knee aches. My junior year in high school I tore my ACL and had reconstructive surgery, so I have screws in it. My roommate just left and it is so hard to do anything around here because she just keeps talking to me even when it is obvious I am busy. How annoying! And she uses my computer all of the time to talk to her boyfriend and it is my computer. Like when I got on to do this paper, she wrote that she had to go and she was sorry but hopefully I would be quick about it. I wanted to tell her something so bad but we have to live together for a year and I don't want to make it a living hell. I don't know how to approach the situation with out us hating each other, but if this keeps on, I will end up hating her. Living with girls sucks because we are all so petty. I skipped my calculus discussion this morning, but it is my only class on tuesdays and thursdays and it had to be at 0 a. m. in RLM, which is so far and I hate that building! well my time is just about up and I am really excited because I am tired of typing. 
__label__label1 Here it goes. 00 minutes seems like a long time but I don't have to think really. Wait, that is the whole purpose. Think, Think, Think. The game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but I would never say anything. Just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Well, I see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. Hopefully I can get her a ticket to the game. Maybe I will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that I will buy a ticket for, lets say, $00. I think that should work. Ever since I came here I have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. It always comes off. It really annoyed me, I mean really annoying. So, when I went home this weekend I bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. I have installed them and could not be more pleased. I have beat the mattress! Victory is mine! Its interesting that I can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. Pretty decent view. Tonight, I worry that I am too behind in my classes. Yet, I can't imagine that everyone in the class is. I mean, I do a pretty decent amount of work. I bet I am about equal with most students. The part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make Cs in there class. That is just not acceptable. I have to go graduate school. How hard is it to go to graduate school? I really don't know. I can't be that hard. Or is it? 00 more minutes what to talk about. My suitemate just started the shower. I can hear the water running. I also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. Pow, Pow, Pow. That must be fun. I, however, am trapped in this writing screen. Write, Write, Write. Like a machine. Now I hear jazz music. I've never really met anyone who like jazz music. This kind of reminds me of Catcher in the Rye. Maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME was just a steam of consciousness. I wish I had a hunters cap to put on. Maybe I could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. Where do they go in the winter, anyway? Does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. Or do they just fly away, fly away. Ah! I've received an instant message. I can't read it yet. Must type, type, type. 0 minutes left, almost there. Nope, that is still a long time. I just noticed my rubik's cube. One side is completed, the others? You guessed it, INCOMPLETE. Maybe one day I will finish it. Ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 0 and a half minutes left. Just keep typing. My neck hurts too. This is making me sleepy. I really want to go to sleep after this. Ah, that would be nice. BUT NO, I have to read. Lots of reading actually. In fact, psychology, 0 chapter. Pow, Pow, Pow. He says, Missed the head. " What does that mean? Head makes me think of beer. That lager has a good, hearty head. Nice, only 0 and a half minutes left. I'm really looking forward to this being over. I guess there are harder things I could do for a grade. Like, I can't think of anything. I thoughts a clogging because I keep looking at the clock. Oh wow, here we go, and I am done! 
__label__label1 Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for PROPNAME. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours. Well technically I have enough to apply for PT school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. Some of then have been there for three years. PROPNAME and PROPNAME had been there for a year and a half or something like that. Well PROPNAME isn't working there, because he is starting PT school. I wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I don't think waking up at 0:00 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that I am in school, but I guess I just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. I don't really like not having a job, I like the security of know I have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. Of course, I think school would be less stressful without a job, but I know I could handle it if I had one. Okay I am at somewhere around 00 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since I typed that. Man I haven't been typing too fast, I guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. I should put the stuff I need from the store on a post it. I think I have some stuff written somewhere, I usually have random post its with reminders. I know I have one for the stuff I need to get at home this weekend, but I'm not sure about the store. I'll look after I am done with this. Okay what next. I wish I could type as fast what I can think. I forget half of what I am thinking by the time I write down the first thought. One minute left. I wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. Maybe I should go to the doctor sometime. It could be what I eat, maybe I am allergic to something, or just not eating right. Time's up, I guess this is it. 
__label__label0 I am so upset with myself today. I am so far behind on my study god I hope I don't fail. I don't want to fail my mom. She would be so disappointed in me. I can't do that to her. Class isn't what I thought it would be. And all the reading god, it is so annoying. PROPNAME is pissing me off so much. You would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and PROPNAME out of her life. No she has to come down every weekend and steal PROPNAME away and get drunk. Oh man that is so fun. Yeah right. I mean PROPNAME is my friend too. I can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 0:00 every night. Then you got homework and early classes. God I just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without PROPNAME calling every ten minutes. You have to share PROPNAME, PROPNAME. My roommate PROPNAME is really cool. She has a great outlook on life. She takes things as they go. I wish I was more like that instead of worrying about everything I do and what people will say. I mean being a girl at ORGNAME you have to look pretty to get a guy. So number 0 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. Next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. And why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. Sorry I'm not into that. I can have fun without that stuff. PROPNAME has this guy she is in to. Supposedly he is a charming jerk. He lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. That is all she talks about. I wish I could find a guy too so we could trade stories. Me and PROPNAME are not from LOCNAME and decided to drive around today to the mall. Boy was that stupid. I was so scared I thought we would never find our way back. God I can't get over the fact PROPNAME would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. I think I will tell her to stay in LOCNAME and make her own friends, I mean I made mine. I am so bummed. I keep thinking I am going to fail out of college. My brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. He was salutatorian in high school and I was only 0th. I am afraid I won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. I mean I have a Kinesiology major. That is a joke to everyone I know. I haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid I have a test or quiz tomorrow. I am going to have to cram. I just don't want to fail. I am so scared about this. I know I will fail if I don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. I'm too lazy and tired of school. I just want to go out to the Real World" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. It would be a lot more easier. I figure if I just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is I don't have any concentration in me. I feel like I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). I really don't but it feels like it because I lack so much energy and motivation. I hope school is okay tomorrow because I do not want to have a bad day. I hate bad days they make me sad. 
__label__label1 Today has been a pretty good day. I am a little worried about my computer class because I can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. I am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. I wish my ex would call me just to check and see how I am doing. Never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. I start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. Hopefully I will make the team. That would be really cool, except if I made varsity somehow, I would miss my family. If I was on varsity I would get to travel a lot, all over the LOCNAME, but I would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. I think college is harder than I thought it was going to be. But, the internet up here, the DSL I have at my apartment, is really fast. I downloaded some songs in like  two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. My shoulders are hurting, and I am a little cold. I need some extra sleep. I shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up Friday and Saturday. I think I ate too much earlier, and now I am too full. Well, I know I have a lot to do tonight. I have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. I took care of my pretesting last night so now I don't have to worry about it. I really need a neck and back massage. I miss talking to my grandma every night. I miss living with her too. College is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because I am responsible for more things than I use to be. I just miss the security I think I felt in high school. If I thought back, I'm sure I would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. But I need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing I can do if I don't want to end up living in a box on the street. I hope everything works out the way I always dreamed it would, and I hope I end up in a job that I love. I don't want to spend thirty years in a job that I hate. I would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. I would much rather be happy than rich. Sometimes, though, I don't think that way. I know I am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. And what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. It is going to be hard on me when she dies. But I am not going to think of that now, because that is in the Lord's hands, not mine. I wish PROPNAME would call me. Why?  Why do I keep saying that?  Damn. That is why I am going to stay up here next weekend. If I stay up here, maybe, HOPEFULLY, I won't think about him as much. And, I will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. I have slacked off the past couple of days, and now I'm going to pay for it. Especially tonight, I am hoping to get caught back up. I wish I could go to bed right now. I am cold. Need to turn the thermostat down. Maybe it would save some money if I didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. But, if I didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, I wouldn't be cold. In fact, knowing me, I would be hot. Okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. I wish I had pants on, instead of shorts, then I wouldn't be cold. I wish I had turned the thermostat down before I started this stream of consciousness. I was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so I am glad I am taking this class. There is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. He makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and I don't know anything about skateboarding. I also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. He does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. I mean, when does this fucker sleep?  Oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. If I lived upstairs I wouldn't stomp around like that. It is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. I wish I could go shopping instead of doing the homework I am going to have to do. That would be nice. I don't know if I am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. That sucks really bad. I want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. Yeah, and go to Academy. I hope college gets easier as I get used to it more. I hope it happens soon. 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about the point of this I guess maybe it does have some point but I really don't see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment I mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes. my dorm room is rather hot and I want to get up to turn our fan on but I won't because then I would have to leave the computer and then I couldn't track my thoughts for those few second that I leave the computer. I waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 0:00 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me I also notice that I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I wonder what I'm going to be typing for 00 more minutes. gosh I have some much to do tonight I have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and I have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then I have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. I don't really like my biology class but I do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and I've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . I hope I don't have an ear infection. I feel like I'm starting to get a headache maybe its because I'm tired or maybe because I'm hungry . or maybe because I'm dehydrated. I dunno but once this is over I think I'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what I'm thinking of . I've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why I have a headache . who knows . but I can't wait till I get to  go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these I bet these can get really interesting I mean if I had to read over 000 of these I'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating?  I'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . I have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. I wish I could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 00 minutes . this is crazy . after this I have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because I know that I'll be tired and I won't feel like doing it an then I'll tell myself that I'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what I need to do but it won't happen . gosh I'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but I think it might be from my jaw and that probably why I have a headache . gosh I really could go for a massage right about now but I don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . I doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm I don't know if I like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that I will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when I close them I want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well I only have like a minute left count down . 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ah nice its over  
__label__label0 PROPNAME'm at my grandmother's house and it's pouring rain. I was supposed to go to this meeting for the ORGNAME ORGNAME but since it's raining I'm not going to go. Even though the social events aren't required its going to bug me all night wondering if the current sweethearts are going to hold it against me. Even though I know other people probably won't go I still feel like I will stick out as not going and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I really don't know. I couldn't be any more tired. I waited in line for 0 in a half hours to get a ticket to the Texas-Ou gPROPNAMEe. It was so chaotic. It's amazing to see how much people will pay for those tickets. Some people were going as high as $000 for one ticket that they sell for $00. Luckily I got one and I'm so happy. I had to go to work after that and it felt like I had just gone swimming because I was drenched in sweat. I looked so bad and I went in 0 hours late. I thought I was going to get fired. I'm going to stay at my grandma's house since it's  raining, I wonder what I'm going to wear?  Why do I care so much?  People go to school looking ten times worse than me and no one cares, but I can't get myself to go to school without makeup. I wish I wasn't so self-conscious. It's weird, you always think you look fine until it comes someone else's turn to judge you than you get nervous about what they think. Who cares?  That's how I wish I could feel. Even though I wear sweat shorts and t-shirts to school I still care if they match or I wonder if I wore it last week. Why can't I stop caring about what people might think about me?  I bet no one even pays attention to me. I really don't know if I'm vain for thinking that people look at me or insecure because I care if they do. I can't believe my boyfriend hasn't called me yet. I met this girl yesterday at the sweetheart meeting and she seemed so cool. We talked and got along and she drove me to my car and we were going to go to the social together. When I called her though she didn't seem the same she was just like Oh, it's you or I don't know. Maybe I expect to much out of people. It just seemed to me that she was being fake yesterday by the way she was acting towards me today. I can't wait until time is up, but it actually hasn't seemed that long. I didn't really think this would be this easy. I guess you can tell things to a computer and it won't tell you to shutup after you complain to much. I WONDER IF I SHOULD READ FOR MY Class tomorrow?  I feel so exhausted like I haven't slept in days and today wore me out. I feel like I could sleep for three days. Hopefully pretty soon I'll catch on to this whole college thing. I have exactly 00 seconds and I really don't know what to write so I'm just going to say that I am PROPNAME happy that I got a TExas-Ou ticket again because it the best thing that has happened in a while. 
__label__label0 writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time, but I have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health. So, maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal. I'm listening to music right now while I do this and it is actually kind of distracting me. Its for my History of Rock Music Class which is actually kind of boring, but I heard its going to get better. As I write this I notice how incredibly bad at typing I am. Other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 00 minutes. I am going to have like a couple of paragraphs. That is really sad. Now, I am thinking all psychological though. I am like oooooh, they are going to read this and think that I compare myself to other people. " I do compare myself to people all the time. I am very competitive. My arms hurt already. I do badly on computers. I hate staring at the screen. When teachers make you read articles off of the computer, I always have to print it out-which is kind of annoying. I also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when I am not thinking about making it good. I am kind of surprised I made an A in rhetoric. I loved rhetoric. It was really interesting for me. All my classes this semester seem interesting. Tough-but interesting. Geology is weird. Hopefully it will get better. I found out today that I could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking Psychology 000. I am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically. So I am sad, but psychology 000 will at least be a good introduction. And now I sound like a suck-up because this is for psych 000. And now I sound like I care about what people think. I do though to some extent. ooooooh fun song on. That Swing Swing Song by All-American Rejects. I like it a lot. It reminds me of the summer. I wish I would've seen American Pie Three. I didn't even see the first or second one though-haha. My room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here. She is strange and different, but she is really unique and I like her a lot. She is never here though. Her boyfriend goes to ORGNAME-just like my boyfriend. She always goes to their games and never has even been to a UT game! I told her she should come to the LOCNAME game with me and she was like "OH YEAH! WE played them last week!" WE. WE. she said "WE" as though she was from ORGNAME. she is crazy. My boyfriend lives in College Station and you will never find me there. There is nothing to do. So, he comes to LOCNAME. I realize I have pictures of people in my room that I do not even like. I only have a picture of this girl PROPNAME because she is really good friends with my boyfriend. She and I are cordial to each other in person. We hate each other really though. I know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. I hate that she hates me because I am usually nice to her. But , I hate her too. But she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. So, I think I have the right to not like her. Wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. I still have 0 minutes left and I feel like I need to do something else. Maybe that means I have ADD. I cannot read for more than like 00 minutes at a time. Its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. I am behind in all of my classes. I study and read-I just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause I don't catch everything. Like I try to keep up, but I can't. Its bad. I need to study more but then I stress myself out if I don't do anything but study. I need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. I stress myself when I study 00/0. That is how it was over the summer. Everyone else went to Frat parties every night and I stayed in and studied. There were NO organizations to be in. There were only frat parties. And I don't even like frat parties all the time. Drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 0 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. And plus boyfriends do not generally like that. So, I stayed in and studied. I was so focused on my grades that I would stress out about getting anything worse than an 00. Because I was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, I stressed out so much that I threw up. it was really bad. All of my friends were REALLY worried about me. I passed out and everything. Over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. I guess I am just not good with my time management. I don't know. Something is really messed up with me I think. My boyfriend thinks I could use a counselor. But if I see a counselor I probably will not have time for activities besides school. And that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. I like that I am doing them. I hope I make Lassos. I am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. We shall see. 
__label__label1 Today has been an absolutely great day, except for the weather. Austin has extremely crazy weather. One minute, it was bright and sunny outside, and the next it was raining cats and dogs!  Of coarse, it continued to do this for the rest of the day. Now that I am in my dorm room, I am beginning to think about what my mom and other friends are doing. It makes me a little sad to think that I am here and cannot be with them. Normally, I do not get homesick, but for the last couple of days I have been missing everyone extremely. I am sure that they are all having fun where they are, but I feel sure that they must miss me too. I just got done talking to my mom, and she said that it is very sunny down in Corpus Christi right now. I miss the excruciating sun that comes along with the cool breeze there. Now, my roommate just walked in, and I really want to go outside because she let some hot air in. It is so cold in this room. Our thermos stat is in the room across the hall from ours, and the girls in that room will not change it. They keep telling us that it is so hot in there room, but I cannot stand it. It is so cold in our room; I always walk around with a blanket. In Corpus, it is never cold, not even in the winter time. It truthfully only get down to about sixty degrees in the winter. It's crazy!  I bet my friend PROPNAME is having so much fun at LOCNAME LOCNAME She calls me every couple of days. In Corpus, we were very close, so for her not to call me that much means she is very busy and having a great time. I wonder a lot about how all my other friends are doing. Another one of my best friends just started at LOCNAME. I hope she likes it. I know her classes will be hard. I do like it here though. I am just beginning to make friends, and I think as time goes on it will get easier and easier. At least, that is what everyone tells me. I went to draw for a football wrist band today. My number was terrible. There is absolutely no way that I am going to get tickets. I wish I could have though. It would have been so much fun! I am not a big football fan, but because ORGNAME is such a big rival, it would have been exciting!  Gosh, it is so cold in here. I feel like my fingers are going to fall off. I hope the rest of the year it is not going to be like this. My roommate is now studying so I will have to be quiet for the rest of the night, but that's ok. I just go outside to talk on the phone or downstairs to watch tv. I believe that is what I will do after I finish this assignment because I really do not have much more homework to do. Actually, just kidding; I have a big economics quiz that I need to study for after I am done. Oh well another fun filled night of homework. This school is much more difficult than my high school. I miss the simplicity of high school. it wsa so much fun. Ok, my time is up so good bye. 
__label__label1 today all I think about is snow skiing, I cannot wait to be in the mountains, its so liberating and right now I feel so tied down and constricted, my room is annoying me at the moment because I do not like my desk space, it is uncomfortable so I find it hard to work in, which makes me not want to do anything at my desk. right now I feel so lost in life, there are so many things that I want to do and I know I have all the time in the world, but I feel like everything is moving so fast, especially now that my best friend is back at school, I feel we just started summer together yesterday and now he and I both are gone and back our separate ways, which is for the best, but at times it is so hard because I feel like a whole sector of my life is missing and I spend most of my days thinking about it and how it really is not that long until we see each other again and I look forward to the coming years but I get scared because I wonder if my future involves him. we have many of the same passions and we desire to do the same things, but I wonder if we will do them together or own way. I constantly think about my future but not really the success aspect, but rather the things that I want to do the things that make me happy, which for awhile would not include a job. I guess I don't really think about growing up that much but really like I said earlier that all I think about is going skiing this winter, I feel like the mountains are my home, like that is where I belong and I am itching to get back, because I have not been in so long. when people ask where my favorite place to be is, it is definitely the mountains. its like this little place god created where I can get away and forget about everything that drags me down, and just allow me to stand in awe and take in all that this earth has to offer, its like it releases me. not only that I love skiing it is my favorite form of exercise, and its just all I can think about considering how hot it is here and I cannot wait to get away the heat and get where the air knocks you off you feet. 
__label__label1 I hear nicole's printer printing I'm so glad she is my roommate I really like the song that's playing on the radio I wonder if my laundry is ready yet paul is a big poo face I wonder if I should tell hijm about my date with PROPNAMEh on friday it's under the table I don't think that I'm very good at this stream of consciousness thing I have to look at the keys when I type on it's kinda annoying I wonder if the professor takes off for stupid internet phrases like lol or kinda man I really can't stand paul I hope that zac doesn't turn out to be someone who's just looking to be laid this assignment seems like it'll be really easy someone just popped up on I'm I wonder if it was dylan I'm supposed to go to a concert with him on friday but zac and I were supposed to go out then I wonder what it would be like to live in austin for all your life new braunfels really sucks at some points in time right no my stomach feels kinda weird probably fro the spaghetti I ate at dinner and nicole's macaroni she htes macaroni cause she got a noodle caught in her throat one time which reminds me of the time I got a peppermint caught in my throat ooh walking on sunshine by reel big fish it reminds me of warped tour with dylan kelly and I don't remember who else went but it probably wasn't that important oh it was ronnie now it's going to be  me dylan paul patrick PROPNAME PROPNAME and james and nick all going to static x and staind in october, I'm really excited about it but kinda scared I'm walking on sunshine my feet hurt from the shoes I was wearing today I love them, they're converse sneakers so cute and they look like they would be comfortable but they're really not which is kinda disappointing rambling like this makes me feel like anne hathaway on princes diareis which makes me think of her in the other side of heaven which is one of my favorite movies nicole and I watched josie and the pussycats last week at some point in time I wonder what mark will think once I tell him that I have a date if I even bother to tell him I already told ward, I think that ward may like me but probably not and don't it feel good? I dig this song, we sang it in choir in sixth grade which brings back memories of casey and how we were the best of friends up until a stupid boy came between us I can hear the air conditioner going and the clicking of nicole's mouse she is doing a cog lab for some reason she is upset that she scored against the norm on it I think that she is really smart and am glad that she and I are roomies it was weird though cause I was in here while she and greg her boyfriend were cuddling she has a question for me but can't remember it I suppose I'll pay attention she did an experiment and has to print it out and it has to be the final name it seems like it should be daniell instead of nicole wow it's only been seven minutes and I'm running out of things to think about well if it's saved under that name um perhaps you should talk to greg about it I think she is oops I didn't realize she was on the phone I miss dancing and am kinda nervous about trying out for the roustabouts I think they're called my hair is tickling my nose I wish that I'd never had bangs to begin with it seems like such a hassle to take care of them and it's taking so long to grow them out nicole is trying to get greg to help her with her computer stuff over the phone he will probably end up coming up here and then I'll have to go down and hang out with ward and mark in my pjs to avoid  feeling awkward if nicole and greg start getting touchy feely I think that he is going to come up I'm glad that they've worked everything out now but it kinda makes me depressed because I don't really have anybody and paul is being a big poo head which is his new name poo head paul. I wonder if punctuation and capitalization and spelling count in this probably not because it's not like humans think using punctuation or caps I like the punk version of this song punk rock princes by something corporate dylan went to see them with 000 last week I wish that I hyad gone now but I haven't even started my biology questions yet and I'm afraid of failing the course and am considering dropping it my tailbone kinda hurts from sitting here so long I don't think that I want to be on AIM when paul gets back I should leave a message up on friday saying that I've gone on a date it should pose for some interesting conversation with him later on that's for sure geez 00 minutes that means that I've still got 0 to go my alarm should go off when it's been that long my laundry is probably already done I'm glad nicole showed me how because I had neglected it for so long we talked to a cool guy in there but I forgot what his name was he was a business major though I wonder  what the weather would be like tomorrow hah nicole said anal and she is talking about laura vasquez a girl from our old high school I think I saw ben campos in my psych class today but it's been so long since I've seen him and think that I keep seeing people who aren't really the people I'm thinking of so it might not have been him I really would not like to see any of them though I came up here to get away from them but oh well, c'est la vie and cool sheep tiffany laughed at that phrase earlier I just don't like beans enough to say cool beans sheep are so much better I feel like a child babbling on and on to an uncaring adult and my time is almost up so that's a good thing I think I've already been through four sogs already nicole's kinda computer illiterate though she did learn how to download stuff from her camera to computer which is more than I can probably figure out I'm thinking about my psych class now and the huge screens used to project the stuff I expected everything to be without overheads or any sort of indication on what we should write down it being all us and sucks for us if we don't know what to study for the test I really should do my biology but I'm not in the mood I keep saying that I'll do it later but honestly it won't get done I think that I say the word honestly too often and I make too many typos when I type I really like my laptop keyboard though the keys are nice and compact and make cool noises when you press them rather than nicole's chunky computer keyboard but what would you give away to have somewhere to go to I don't think that I would give up everything for just one other person though the bible says so which reminds me that I should probably e-mail my bible study instructor christie later on tonight just to let her know what is going on her kids go to school in austin jon and katie they're really cute christie and her husband got divorced a while ago and it seems like a horrible thing that they went through I don't really want to ask her about it though cause it's not my business and it seems like a touchy subject  which brings to mind richard who called paul a dick after I told him that paul had told me that he kissed jade I think I'm getting better at accepting the fact that they're together at least it's easier to do up here than in NB it seems that the further away from my problems I am the easier they become to handle I wonder how many other people are doing their assignments today my alarm just went off and it scared the crap out of me I'll have to go get my laundry after I'm done maybe I'll try out my new iron and ironing boars are we supposed to  
__label__label1 I am sitting in front of my computer in a small Jester dormitory. I look around and I notice that the room is a complete mess. I take a deep breath and I can smell something funny. That's right, that's how Jester rooms always smell like. I am feeling pretty full right now after a eating a delicious sandwich from the Jester City Limits. The room is nice and cold, unlike the hot and humid weather outside. My roommate is out of the room right now, so it's a little quieter than usually. I am playing some music on my computer right now. Besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer, I can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways. My roommate walks in after eating at Jester City Limits. I say hi to him and how his dinner was. He notices something weird as I read out what I am typing. He asks, What the crap are you doing?"  I respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class. I turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next. I am sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room. I uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb. I hear someone using the blow-dryer in the bathroom, which is right outside of my room. I look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks. That reminds me that I have lots of other homework to do when I finish with this assignment. I have a strange anxious feeling because I am a little behind in all my classes, especially with reading the textbooks. I think about how I have missed three morning classes already, a quiz in one of those classes, and I get an awful, guilt-like feeling because I don't want to do badly in my classes. Maybe I should go to sleep earlier tonight, for that matter, every night. I notice my computer's processor making slight noises as I am typing. I take off my glasses because I only need them to read. I look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work I still have left to do. I notice that I have been shaking my right leg. Maybe I have been doing this the whole time?  Some sort of a nervous habit I guess. I feel a little pain on the surface of my knee. I reach down and touch the band-aid covering a wound that I suffered from playing soccer at LOCNAME last night. And the twenty minutes is up. A pop up says that I can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness. Does that mean that I should just finish with my train of thought, or should I keep writing more and more?  Maybe that would help me get a better grade on this assignment. Ok, I am going to just stop and press the "Finish" button. 
__label__label1 Well, I guess this is the first time that I have ever done anything like this. I mean, the first time that I have talked about ANYTHING to anyone. What I'm really thinking about right now is index cards. I need to make flash cards for my Introduction to Medical and Scientific Terminology class, and I don't have any index cards. I feel like I need to complete that task now. Why is it that I must always do EVERYTHING in one day? I just can't ever seem to take my  time and relax. I guess if I had any form of OCD, that would be it; I'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule. Now, if I wait until this Stream of Consciousness Writing is over, it'll be like almost eleven thirty at night before I'm done. Should I really go out and get my index cards then? I need like a pack of 000 of them, but I really need more for the future. I guess I could wait to get more index cards when I get home to LOCNAME this weekend, then I would know exactly where to buy them, or I could even get my mom to get them for me in LOCNAME, that would be very convenient for me. I miss my mom most. She does everything for me. Its not that I miss her just because she did everything for me; its just that she is this really great person. She is so genuine. I know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy. Why can't I meet more people like that in my life? I hope I marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can. Man, I miss my dog, too. I guess I am a little obsessed with my dog, but I can't help it. She is so cute. And she is been there ever since I was like 00. We're inseparable, and I wonder and worry about how she is doing without me. Dogs are great aren't they? They never get angry at you or make you upset. They always are loyal, and give love one hundred percent. I wish that people could be as nice as dogs are. I wish my boyfriend would be happier. He is the main reason why I worry so much of the time. I really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen, until I met him. I worry a lot about him, not about our relationship, but about him. I wish he would be happier, treat himself better, love himself more, and feed himself. The man's the pickiest man I have ever met! I have never made one thing that he thought was yummy. I have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good. Everything is always decent. " Decent? I know he doesn't mean to be condescending in any way, but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending. I know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, I don't know if he will ever feel that. That's one thing about psychology. My boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when I try to give it to him. I believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything I do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. His mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. It's all in the mind. If he told himself to like it, he would; But the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. All right, I'm going to shut up about him all ready. I think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. It's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show "Sex and the City," except that these thoughts are really not very private because I guess Professor PROPNAME or one of the TA's is going to read it, but I'm really okay with one of them reading it. It's not like I have anything really vulgar or nasty to say. I'm so full. I don't think I should have eaten all that PROPNAME PROPNAME and Cheese, but hey, on the bright side, its a great source of calcium, which is something that growing women need, so I guess its kind of a good thing. Hahaha. I can't believe that I just tried to justify overeating, at least I don't have to worry about getting fat over it. Nobody in my family is fat or even chubby. I don't think I've gained any weight here because I do so much walking, so who cares if I ate extra macaroni; I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I added salt to it instead of butter, thus I feel no guilt. Dude, I could really go for a ORGNAME right now. ORGNAME ORGNAME is so good. Its so expensive though, and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys. What makes it taste so good? I think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it; not like that nasty gross Diet Cola. Diet Cola is disgusting. I don't understand why people drink Diet when there's real Cola. I'm sleepy. I don't sleep much here in LOCNAME, because all I do is go to school, and then I come home, eat, and then do homework for the whole rest of the time. It's a bitch. I need my sleep man. I don't get more than 0 hours of sleep at most. I had four freaking classes today! Can you believe that? from 0 in the morning to 0 in the afternoon, I had class. And get this, what really made today bad was that while I was waiting for the bus, a huge, green, black striped, spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face! I thought I was going to DIE! I HATE SPIDERS! If I had any kind of phobia, its spiders. I don't like any bugs, but Spiders are the worst. They're so ugly and creepy and scary. I thought I was really going to cry. It made me so anxious and nervous. I went home and showered. My writing assignment is almost over now. I feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time, how pathetic. hahaha. I'm kinda sad because I like writing all my thoughts down, but I'm relieved because I have a lot of other stuff to do still. 
__label__label1 I just had a conversation with PROPNAME. She can be so touchy sometimes. It seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she can't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying. Just a few minutes before hand, I was telling her about what I need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness" writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect, she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that wasn't pre-planned. I told her that that was not "stream-of consciousness" because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story. Then she just got irritated and told me that I don't do that to her. And I was like, "What?". She doesn't make any sense. Oh dear. LOCNAME is screaming her head off and I have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight. It is 00:00 and she usually starts screaming about now. LOCNAME is a nice bird though, other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood. She usually keeps herself pretty entertained. There she goes again. I should tell monica to cover her. PROPNAME is probably busy with her studies. How am I supposed to tend to my bird while I am doing this assignment? I have to stay here and complete it or then I wouldn't really be doing the assignment right. That brings up another point. What is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 00 minutes. Are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment? Would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break? Ok, I had to go cover the cage but it didn't take more than five seconds(literally) because the cage is on the other side of the room that I am in. That is a relief. Now she isn't screaming. Now what should I write about. Hmmm. I had a yoga class today. ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was very difficult to do and very fun. I hope to become really flexible this semester. I also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester. I got a texercise pass from Gregory gym for 00 dollars and I have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes. It is wonderful. I just wish I didn't have this psychology class at 0:00 to 0pm because two really good classes go on at that time. It is really disappointing. I can't believe I am taking a psychology class(000) this late into my undergrad. I am a senior and I am just taking this class because I decided just recently I want to go into Counseling Psychology. And in order to do that I need 0 Psychology classes with a "B" or higher. I am going to make an A in this class. This summer had a large effect on me. I realized that I really didn't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family. I think I just spelled that "adequate" word incorrectly. I hope this assignment isn't going to be graded on spelling. That would be ridiculous because this is a "stream of consciousness" paper. What if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly. This page doesn't have a spell checker. People are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing. Have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing? My sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers. That seems so ancient now and that was only about 00 or 00 years ago. Its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years. What is going to happen next? I will tell what will happen next. We will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left. The earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise. I think they should study that in psychology. Why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings? We are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources. We are causing a great imbalance in nature. Would they even be able to study that in psychology? That might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they don't want to admit how ridiculous humans are. or rather, can be. I really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology. Or at least I have more experience in those other two areas. I tend to take the middle ground however. I am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and I am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment. I think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist. Am I going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology? I hope not. Psychology is a good field, don't get me wrong, but one has to remember that everything has its faults. I took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments. Some of the questions were funny to me. I think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica. Haha. My 00 minutes are over. Guess you don't get to read about my opinions on erotica. 
__label__label1 I don't know what to feel or think. I am so overwhelmed with everything. I have felt this way for the past two weeks, but it just seems like it is all crashing today. I think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow. I feel like I have so much to do before we leave. I have so much homework everyday, and so much with my sorority, and I just want to have time to hang out and take it all in. Not saying that I never have time, because I do, but not much. Anyway, today we signed for our apartment next year. Its so crazy that you have to do that this early here. But I am so excited about it. I'm living with my roommate, my suitemate, one of my pledge sisters, and both of her suitemates. it's going to be so awesome. So I had to pay that money today and in a couple of days, we have to pay like 000 dollars again, so that is a little crazy. I can't wait until I get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right. like I'm having a blast and everything, but I feel so busy. I missed my first class today because I was so behind on reading in another class. I'm hoping I can control myself with that and not miss too often. I feel so behind in most of my classes. three of my classes have been all reading, and that is so hard for me. I'm such a slow reader. I just need a weekend where I do nothing but homework and study, but I won't ever have that, because there's football here, and I like to have fun on the weekends. so, I love my sorority. They are all the sweetest group of girls. We have such an awesome pledge class. I'm living with one of my pledge sisters who I have become pretty close to her. I love her she is awesome. We had our pledge retreat last weekend, and I got to know so many more of the girls. I can't say too many good things about all of them. and I love the actives, too. The seniors have been so sweet to us. Our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever. I love going there and feeling so loved by everyone, it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place. Anyone of them would do anything for us, and that makes me feel so good, and safe. Did I mention that I feel like I'm doing homework nonstop. haha. I really need to read tonight, I have to stay ahead. or rather get ahead. that is the one thing that I heard over and over again from college students: stay ahead on your work. I need to try harder to do that, because in high school I was such a procrastinator and I can't be like that here. I really need to do good, but does not everybody. especially since I want to get into the ORGNAME program. my problem is, I can study when no one's here, and when everyone on my hall is sleeping or in class, but when they're all home, I love talking and goofing off with them. me and my suitemate love to dance so we always make up dances in front of the mirrors. I know, we're dorks, but we have fun. Our hall in my dorm is so awesome. its crazy how close we got in such a short amount of time. I feel so lucky. Even people on other floors in my dorm notice it, there like, I wish I was on your floor yall are so close. and we're always like, yeah we know. haha. but oh well. so me and courtney are going home tomorrow! I'm so excited. I want to see everyone so bad. I'm really excited to see my sister and my dog. I'm excited to see everyone, but I saw my mom and dad and one of my sisters last weekend at the football game. I have not seen my oldest sister since I moved down here. she is pregnant and due in october. I am so incredibly excited. its crazy. I say crazy a lot, but maybe because that is what my life is right now. and I can't wait to see my dog , ellie, either. I love her so much, and miss her so much. she is a dalmation and 00 years old and so cute and lazy and just likes to be pet. she is my favorite. I need to decide what I want my mom to cook for dinner tomorrow night. I am so ready for a home cooked meal. I wish I was staying a little longer. we're leaving tomorrow afternoon at like 0000, and then we're coming home on friday after the homecoming pep rally we're going to, because there's a football game here at 00 on saturday. and I'm NOT missing a football game here. I love college football, and I love ORGNAME football. it is so much fun. I have to go stand in line for OU tickets in the morning. I think I got a pretty good number, from what I here, so how awesome would that be if I got tickets my freshman year. that's going to be one crazy game, and its going to be so cool to get to go and actually be a part of the school. its going to be totally different than watching in still in high school. my birthday is in 0 weeks. I can't wait. I'm going home that weekend. so that will be really fun. I love birthdays. I'm so anxious for my sister to have her baby, its due in like 0 weeks, so you never know. she may have it early or she may have it late. her name is abby. and she is going to be the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to be an aunt. I hope she has chubby cheeks. I'm so excited. yay! 
__label__label1 Well, here I am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. I do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as I do. Lack of sleep, maybe. Laziness, probably. I consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects I always put it off until the last minute. I just got home tonight, its past midnight, and I am tired. I really want to go to sleep so I am not dead during classes tomorrow. I am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. This is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. Pretty much all my classes are going well, but I am not sure how I am going to study for exams. However, I think that if I keep up my study habits that got me here, I will do just fine. I am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and I do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. My eating habits worry me too now. Three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all I go for. My head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. I really love music. No matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. I enjoy all different kinds, and I have listen to a variety since I have started writing. It is quite weird now that I think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. I have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that I truly love. The whole college experience has been great so far. I love the campus, the professors, and the people. Most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. I almost look forward to each new school day now that I'm at the University. Being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that I wish I was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything. 
__label__label1 Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, LOCNAME LOCNAME, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday. For some strange reason our room always gets real cold. And then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they can't move it unless we fill in some sort of request. And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 00 minutes. finished. 
__label__label0 I am thinking about why exactly I am writing this. I am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys. PROPNAME is on and it is starting to distract me. I really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me. The show is talking about feminism, which brings up an interesting point. I really don't like women who are amazingly feministic. I just forgot what my next thought was. Oh well, I feel kinda of hungry. Maybe I should get something to eat. But instead I have this laptop sitting on me while I try to type my steam of consciousness. Speaking of stream of consciousness, which I spelled wrong above. The stream of consciousness is something that I read in the textbook. Some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves. PROPNAME just made a joke and it is funny. But as I was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses. Before I digress, or maybe I will or maybe I won't. Now that I choose to reflect on my day I realize that I didn't get that much accomplished, but there is still a lot of the day left. I am really not sure where I am going from here. There was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah. boy I sure do love hi I just answered my phone and it is PROPNAME my friend she is also in psychology. we are talking about this assignment. she is walking back from the dobie center. I am supposed to meet her and her friend PROPNAME. I am going to play PROPNAME in football on the video game. Boy I really like football. Like I was saying I love football and I can't wait till the game against LOCNAME. Boy that is sure going to be a good game. I just happened to notice that I only have six minutes left to write. I really like this assignment it is really fun. My hands are getting tired of typing and I just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny. I really don't like Roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention. I am really trying to concentrate on what I am thinking but I believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more, because I am thinking so hard. My computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot. But in here it is actually cool. Speaking of my dorm room, I really like it. Well my 00 minutes is up but I am just going to finish writing this last line right here. 
__label__label1 OK, I have writer's block. I guess I'll think of this assignment as a diary. Today was a pretty interesting day. I met a lot of people who spoke Spanish, so that made me feel more at home. This stupid bracelet is bothering me. I miss PROPNAME, my ex-boyfriend. I wonder if anyone's going to read this nonsense, and who ever is reading this, I feel sorry for them. I'm not that cool in my head. My room mate is gone. She is bowling. I wonder what she is doing. Maybe sitting there bored. She is always bored everywhere we go she has this face, that makes me bored. I miss my family, even though when I'm there I don't really talk to them. I guess I'm just used to them being around. I wonder if I'm prone to meningitis? Should I get the shot?  Knowing my luck, if I don't get, I'll be well, to dead in 00 hours. I'm scared of needles. Damn, I'm scared of everything!    Oh, crap almost erased everything I had written. Computers are not for me. What is for me?  I like Psychology. The lectures are super interesting. Do I have any better word?  Nah, interesting is an OK word. I feel so non-intellectual. See, that just shows my inability to express myself in words. Physically I'm very expressive. But I that's what I think. My ex probably doesn't think so. No, he does. I miss reading in U. I. L. I just realized that being in college makes you miss a lot of things. I wonder if I'm going to make it out of here?  Sometimes I meet people just like me and tell myself, don't worry you're not alone, but other times people are so articulate in class it intimidates me. I set a goal for myself when I first got here and I can't do it. I'm suppose to ask at least one question per class per week. But I just can't with all those people staring at me. Once I open my mouth, they're going to realize what an idiot I am. This sounds so cliché. Other people probably wrote all these philosophical questions on their stream of consciousness, like Why are we here? Did PROPNAME believe that as humans. Well, I don't write like that. I'm just a bundle of unanswered questions. Ahhh, my back's starting to hurt. I like that guy who walked me to my room. Is that all were suppose to write. OK never mind. That girl from LOCNAME is really nice. She reminds me of a friend from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I hope I meet more people like her. It'll help me sleep better. I've had really bad insomnia. I could be depressed or just a freshman in LOCNAME. Maybe both. I don't get what happened to my first letter in every sentence. It disappeared into the left side. What did I push?  OK 00 seconds left. I'm so glad I'm almost done with my first assignment. Is this what he wanted?  I hope I did this right. Bye. 
__label__label1 I just got out of psychology class like an hour ago so I thought I would do this paper while I am still in the thinking mode. I thought what pennebaker said about how students new to the college experience, like myself are under lots of stress. that is true. and how they are more prone to get sick when they go home because their stress is relieved. but I think I am sick right now because I've been coughing a lot and my nose is all clogged up. I think it's from the air conditioning in my dorm. but I'm not supposed to be sick now, right? anyways I've been here in austin for almost three weeks now and I have had lots of new experiences but I am beginning to get homesick. I miss my mom, dad, and sisters, and the city of houston. I am glad that I have friends from high school here that I can lean on. just ate dinner. it was really good and now I'm really full. my dance class starts tomorrow, can't wait for that. I don't like sleeping on the top bunk, don't sleep very well, been taking lots of naps. probably cause I stay up too late and have to get up early. lots of traffic noises outside. can hear buses. reminds me of when I got on the completely wrong bus the first week of school. I met a guy and have been hanging out with him. he seems really cool. I want to us to be friends but scared he might want to be more than friends. just adds to all the stress. I really need to be at the library studying right now. I think I will go when I finish this. just learned how to play racquet ball the other day. it's really fun, but very exhausting. I am so sore. also my legs hurt from walking around campus so much. I am really out of shape. everybody is concerned about the freshman fifteen but I really don't care if I gain fifteen pounds. it is highly unlikely since I eat like a bird, but I would be okay with the extra weight. I'm not going home until the end of september which means I will be going five weeks without seeing my family. I've never gone for more than a week without seeing them. can't wait to go home and see them and go to a pat green concert in houston. seems like not many people here listen to country music which is mostly what I listen to, although I do like other kinds of music. my twenty minutes is up. got to go! 
__label__label1 Hey what is up. Just writing my homework. I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction ". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those "teen movies" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 0 minutes 00 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 0 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 0 min 0 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 00 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 00 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, LOCNAME, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but PROPNAME is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in LOCNAME. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the ORGNAME would win only 0 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 00 min 00 sec. Today is Wednesday. 0/0/00. September 00 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 0/00 was a drug deal gone bad with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Heroin is a major export out of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. The LOCNAME Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the LOCNAME LOCNAME in 0000. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. PROPNAME is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 000. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 00 min 00 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done 
__label__label0 sick nose running I feel like shit I think being sick makes me look ugly. I hate when I feel ugly especially in psychology class where there are so many beautiful girls they're all so different amazing I have a lot of anger in me sleep deprivation is getting to me gentle breeze made by a rickety fan in my room ac is not working like it should 00 years old I'm thinking what a dance club would be like I want to play guitar when this is over I wonder if playing can compensate for the lack of female companionship. I have tried, it all I think about. blinds dirty lips a little dry eyes burning butt getting tired would it feel that way if you got laid? wonder who came up with that word. fight club I wonder if tupac shakur could have played tyler durden's role, that is if PROPNAME PROPNAME's character was black. its friday and I don't have many things to do I think of what a date would be like. sometimes I can't believe how hard college dating is I mean is not this time about exploration so why do girls hold back so much. I don't know, it very important to me for some reason I wonder if you look better when you're sick or just like that sickly? this exercise is not free flowing as I thought it would be, I want to type continuously but can't I have to pause and formulate my thoughts into words, sucks I have so many abstract thoughts not thought in words, see I was hoping to excel in this too because psychoanalysis was a career field I was into. being good at this kind of exercise without practice would give me a flash of brilliance I hate looking out the window I feel like an old man depressed about life contemplating I have a strong sexual urge in me right now, I want to make love to a girl not sex I want to pride myself in the fact that I'm a rare college guy who can make love and not just have sex or get laid. I think about when girls smiled at me or were attracted to me, does that necessarily mean there is sexual chemistry. in my thoughts, yes. but real sex is different from thoughts, too many details you forget when you think about it. there are so many girls I want to get with at my 000 person psy class but I still have not and probably won't. I wonder how that affects me, especially on an unconscious level. maybe it translates into a low self opinion because I think that every girl thinks I'm ugly. how do I get over that negativity. is there a way to feel good, even if you don't get girls? can someone that does not have what someone else has, can they be as happy as that person?  my sexual thoughts are gone now, I'm still sick, about to sneeze, wow my thoughts are a lot more free flowing now, I have not stopped typing for about 0 minutes. I think I see it now, I'm getting deeper into my unconscious or preconscious maybe I'm thinking of all the girls that walk by. do they know, that if they snap their fingers, they can have any guy they wanted, what power. makes me wonder how I should deal with them. I think it would be very hard to get with them sexually because they all want something very specific. I thought about listening to music while doing this, but for the first 0 minutes I have found that it limits your thoughts to the subject matter and emotion of the song. I would rather get in touch with myself and hopefully have this analyzed and see what it means. next thing I want to do is free word association although not sure what it is. thoughts of mine still not as deep I thought, oh well 
__label__label1 my room mate is listening to wierd music again. I have never heard of all these canadian bands. I really want to go to sleep. That would be so great right now. I can't wait to go home soon for the weekend. I would love to see my family soon since they are so fun. I really need a hair cut. I have split ends. There is a girl in our hall learning to play some sort of trumpet. She really sucks and I just wish she would give it up or practice somewhere else. I can't believe I have only been typing for 0 minute!  I really want to paint my dorm room. White is such a boring color. My suite mates got a beta fish this weekend. its a really pretty color. Better that the white of our room. I really want to sleep. looking at my bed makes me want to sleep. I can't even keep my eyes open any long. I have the longest, skinniest fingers in the world. I am also really not liking the fact that I have to read some much more in all my classes. I have 0 really cute cats at home. They are so fun to play with and cuddle. I really wish pets were allowed in dorms. I would so bring them up and then everyone in the hall would get to see them. I ran over my phone minutes again this month. I seem to talk on it a lot more that I realize. I am going to get a brain tumor by the age of 00. I really like the fact that I have gotten lots of mail since being here. All my friends have sent me mail. I got some today! Mail is fun. I feel bad though cause all my room mate gets is bank statements. sucks for her. Lots of people I know are in Psychology. They are all going to do this assignment too. I really can't spell well. Sorry if you are reading this. Well I think nothing really sticks to the walls in this dorm. I tried to hang curtains last weekend with this hook that was supposed to stick to anything and hold 00 lbs. But all it did was all and pull off a huge chunk of the wall paint. I can't get my pinata to hang from the ceiling either. I wander if anyone has been able to get stuff to stick?  I will have to ask around. I am the world smallest stapler on my desk. It was part of a dorm set I got for graduation. My friend who goes to ORGNAME gave it to me. I wonder what she is doing. I am going to call her when I am done with this. But I am over my minute, that is ok. I think my suite mate is doing the pretesting experiment. She is enjoying it too. I asked. I am going to learn to play tennis. My room mate is done playing her canadian music, but is not from LOCNAME. She is from plano os that is kinda odd. How did she ever hear about this music. I think I will get a beta fish too. They look fun and it would be something different to add to my room. But then I don't really like cleaning stuff so maybe not. I am so tired and my head really hurts. I need so aspirin. I need to exercise too. I ate too much for dinner. I like what I ate though. I got a catered dinner for free. What could be better- a nap. I wonder what my friends are doing. I got really good tickets to the football game- need to thank PROPNAME. Its dark out. That is a huge tree 
__label__label1 Well I'm sitting at my computer and I don't really have much to say. For some reason I feel as though my mind is completely blank. My roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. I am so tired right now. Last night I was up with no thoughts in my head. I was just not able to sleep for some reason. I really hope that this school year goes good for me. I know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. I have always dreamt of coming to college and now that I am finally here it still seems like a dream. I guess its just hard to believe that I'm on my own, six hours from home. I miss my old friends and my girlfriend, PROPNAME, I can't wait to see here this weekend. Football season is about to start and I am getting so excited to see my first Longhorn game. My mind just went blank again. no thoughts. I think I just used to many dots between words. My nose itches. I need to use the bathroom, but I still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and I don't want to stop now. For some reason it seems as though I have been here typing for a long time but really I haven't even typed much. Maybe I type slow. I'm trying to think of what to type now. It seems so easy. ?Just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe I'm trying to hard. The phone is ringing. I guess I'll get it. it is was my mom. Yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. That sounds good to me because I could really use it right now. It looks as though I have barely typed anything. I'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. Man I'm thirsty. I could use a spite or a cold coke. Maybe I'll go get one in a little while, or not cause I need to save money. It's tough not having a job and wanting so much. I'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that I don't even need in the first place. Six more minutes and I will be done. It actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. I wonder how my dog is doing. I hope my mom is feeding her just as I said, and giving her lots of water. She needs that especially in the hot sun. I can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. No thoughts. still none. I think I'm getting addicted to the dot thing. Two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. Every second seems to go by slower and slower now. I really don't want to drive home this weekend. I wish I could fly, but I'll be alright. I just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. Well it's been twenty minutes so I guess I'm done. 
__label__label0 Well, I am almost ready to leave tomorrow back to my house in fort worth, although I would like it to be better to go back because since I have to work tomorrow, that makes it kind of boring and I cannot stop thinking about work instead of enjoy my time over there. Every time I go I always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend, that actually never really happens, I don't really know how I feel about it because sometimes I feel frustrated that I cannot do anything about it but then I analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head. The fist thing I have to do before I leave is get all my homework done, including this assignment that I didn't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does. Since the first day that I slept in this dorm, it seems that the bed is not for me or something, I cannot fall asleep, and if I do, I wake up every 00 min and look at my clock to see if it's time to go to class. I remember I used to love school when I was in high school last year, everything was so cool, nothing was going so bad to call it bad, grades, girlfriend, family MONEY, but now some times I feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with, I cannot handle so much stress, never had so much actually. anyways, the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because I know I'm not a failer. Hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good!. The biggest problem that I have and that I think already gave me a pain in my neck, well that's because I cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so  I think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems. I have to pay my whole semester rent next monday, that's one of the reasons I'm going home tomorrow, to get a juicy check that will just fly away from my hands. I only I was living in my house and going to a college near, I would be able to keep all that money and use it to get rid of my debt and actually be able to buy a gift for my girlfriend. I have bunches of pictures of her all around my room. I also have pictures of my mother and little sister. she is 0 and I miss her. I hope tonight I can fall asleep easy so I won't be tired during my 0 hour drive. everytime I drive tired I get nervous and think that I may fall asleep and all these thoughts come to my mind that I'm going to crash a big truck and never make it home. I know that the odds are really small and then I get better once I start listening to this exact same music I'm listening to right now. its a band called mana, is from mexico and they play really good kidda alternative music but is really meaningful and then they talk about world peace and they help children with massive foundations, with no doubt my favorite band. they are coming to dallas next october, I can't wait till then to go to the concert, I went to one last november and I still remember almost every second of it, this time I'm thinking on taking my girlfriend to make the concert even better. I just hope that I will have money to but the tickets then, cause now I don't. jeje,     A few hours ago I was doing my physics homework, it's just really hard, when I was in high school I was the best kid on physics and now I just feel really bad when I don't understand!, never happened before, I don't know if is because I cannot concentrate or because it's just really hard or because I'm loosing my intelligence, I think of that all the time, I have this scholarship that is helping me a lot with my finances but if my gpa goes down 0. 0 , they will take it away and then I will really be in deep trouble. I just saw a picture or one of the pictures I have of my girlfriend in my room and that reminded me that I have to ask her if her dad said yes! finally. we have been going out for almost a year and she just turned 00 last saturday, I was a really nice night, the problem is that her father doesn't know about us yet, we are afraid we might not like our relationship and then all would fall down. I feel guilty for making her disobey her dads rules but we love each other and finally I would be the happiest guy ever if I can make it trough this semester maintaining  a good gpa and if my girlfriends dad agrees on our relationship. When I think of these, it feels like everything is worth it to wait and suffer and not sleep and study like crazy, so that's what I'm going to do 
__label__label0 So here goes. I am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff. It seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time I have to complete everything just keeps shrinking. I hope and pray that as time goes by I will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life. It has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work. But as my brother once told me, you must work hard in order to play hard. I'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly, and keep thinking positive about my situation. I'm hoping that I can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come. Well enough about that. I'm really starting to miss my family a lot. I think that is really lame but I can't help it really. Like I love PROPNAME and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of LOCNAME, LOCNAME that I miss incredibly. I went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends. Gosh I love my friends here but its just not the same. There is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave. But I know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals. And LOCNAME is the place to do it. I love this place! The people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change. I am so excited about this weekend! One of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and I keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend! Gosh you know what. I'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 00" theory! Because I sure do eat a lot these days. The food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist! Its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you. No here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it! Its great! Its amazing to me how different college life is from high school. Like in high school everyone cared about everyone else's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here. No one cares about anyone else's business at all. people are just concerned with themselves. And another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules! Like you can do whatever the heck you want and NO ONE will tell you that you are wrong or that you can't do something. Oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking, you can! I laugh every time I see people doing that in my classes. I would never be able to make myself do that because I'm too much of a chicken but I think its so funny! Gosh. I'm really starting to get hungry again. that is so bad! NO! I can't eat again! I am really not looking forward to going to class again at 0pm. that is really late and I'm extremely tired! I really hope that I can find a date to Anchors Away. that is really bugging me. I wish I knew exactly who I wanted to take and who wanted to go so that I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore! Alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so I'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me. haha! This was good. its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once. I actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper. Not to mention that I feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing I have to worry and stress out about. Well that is all I have to say for myself at this point and time! Peace! 
__label__label0 Ummm this is sorta weird. I think its odd that we have to write for 00 minutes about what is going through are heads. I know that sometimes I don't know that I am thinking about something. but I am sure that it is happening. Like when I exercise. I normally don't think about any thing? Or am I? Great now everytime I exercise I am going to think about what I am thinking about and that is going to take away from the effort I put into my workouts. Damm. I should have stayed at the gym longer today. 00 minutes of cardio is not enough. I was not as tired as a seemed. I could be there right now, still burning calories away on the weights or cardio. Are we supposed to go back and read this for mistakes or just submit it because I keep rereading what I wrote that doesn't seem like what we are supposed to be doing. Oh well, I'm a horrible typer. Uhhhhhhh that shower felt good a bit ago but I wish that I had brushed my hair before I decided to start typing. its hanging all around my face and its annoying. Wonder what the meeting is going to be like tonight. I wonder how much different it will be then Crew. Do I really want to get involved in rowing again? Yes. Do I want to do it with a team? Yes. Why because I push myself harder but I also get tired easier. Grades are important. But so is having fun. Rowing = fun. Women's rowing. supposedly they pay for it all, all the costs. What if they don't? Then I can't be on it, that will suck, then I will be sad and then I will have to do something else. But all the other organizations suck. I don't want to be with a bunch of stupid snotty girls in some lame sorority. I work for my money and pay for my car and cloths and food. Those girls whose parents pay for everything suck. I wish my parents could afford to pay 0000 a semester for me to be in something like that but no because I am a normal college student. Man rich people make me mad. I am never going to be rich. I have to do rowing I have to. ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm that was exciting. stupid sorority girls I am glad I punched hilary in the face. I really hope she has a huge bruise on her jaw. But I shoulda stayed there and let her take a swing at me instead of walking away like a little pussy. Naw, there was too many guys around there is no way that they would have let me hit her again. Especially after how hard I hit her the first time. I wish she had taken a swing at me though. That would have been exciting. I could tell everyone that I got in a fight with a girl. Not like I am trying to fight with people or anything. But she had no right to write that shit on my sisters shirt and tif was just going to take it. man if I was in tifs spot and hilary had written that on my shirt I would have had someone immediately tell me what it said I would have hunted her down in the party and whooped her so bad. but because tif isn't like me I had to do it instead. That makes no sense. It sucks having a twin. Wait it doesn't suck but I don't understand. Why did I get so mad about that. Would I have done that if hilary had written that on Audreys shirt? Probably not. Interesting. Ohhhhhh psychology could make an interesting case study out of me right now. Haha twins. why are people so interested in studying us. We are two separate people. Can't they understand that. I am glad that I didn't participate in that testing they wanted us to do last year. No way are you going to get me to sit in a sound proof room by myself with wires attached to my head, by myself for 0 hour. LOCNAME. You would have to pay me more then 00 to do that. And then they wanted me to answer a set of personal and non personal questions about myself. ohh they would remain confidential. So  I don't want ANYBODY knowing about my sex life, drug use or problems or things I do to stay happy and be fit. That is my business. Man. and then they want to compare all my information to my sisters. the good twin and try to make me look bad. I can see it in the journal article now. 'A study at the university of texas reveals that twins have opposite personalities. If one had used drugs in the past this proves that. blah blah blah if one is fatter this means. blah blah blah. Erhhhhh I am not sure exactly how much I am going to like this class since it has to do with studying stuff like that. Man I am worried now about what I just wrote everything is so negative and m,ean. I am really not like that I am not in a bad mood either . it just feels like since we have to write this is all the stuff that I have been thinking about when FORCCED to write. I don't always think as mush as I have in the past 00 minutes. great almost done 00 seconds left. I am going to type really slow now just to finish. 00. glad I'm done  
__label__label1 man I wish that I didn't lose to my friends in foosball, when will I get to see my parents again, I really miss my dog. I would like to take some pills to get bigger but I don't know which ones I want to take my legs are so soar I can't wait to play football tomorrow but why does my hair always get in my eyes I feel really stressed out right now I really want to do good but it is hard to do the green grass looks so nice at my house n riviera I never was good at hitting the golf ball but cameron was a cool guy pistol is such a good dog my calculus homework sucks really bad I'm tired of doing it man I just spit on my computer when I coughed compaq computers are not even good man but my grandma is such a sweet lady I wish my papa was still here she misses him a lot and my uncle doesn't even care much about her or at least he doesn't pay much attention daniel was on a horrible team in basketball yes the astros are two games up in the central to bad the cowboys lost quincy carter will never amount to anything the people what was I just thin philosophy is a cool class man I don't want to do my calculus homework he gave me the wrong answer texas is going to kill memphis I mean arkansas that was a really good catch by joe jerivisus warren sapp's was better though gosh I need it get a car what was her name man she is hot but I don't think that she really likes me I'm tired but I don't want to go to bed but I need to oh well I will just sit around and think all night about stupid stuff I want to get bigger but I don't want to work out I should have went to gnc today but I wanted to eat at least I changed the oil in my car man I can't get the headlight fixed I need to call my dad I miss my room I wish that I could go home and see my family but I don't want to mmmmmmm what was I thinking about shit I can't remember I like my brothers house man I wish luke would go out more basketball is almost here the court looks sweet there are a lot of fans that go now I wished that tj was still here when is the kobe trial going to start I know he is guilty stupid oj I can't believe that the tv fell on bruce's head I like that english class the playground was fun stupid christian there was always broken glass and the tree the pond was cool I swear that there was I snake there but allen left an I could not really tell I can't believe that I told my parents that I snake chased or the time I fell into the ditch and luke left me I should have never given up me and benny could have hammered them we went and ate pizza what is that game called mmmmm damn I can't remember the watermelon and the forts haha benny the power saw man or whatever PROPNAME's was a cool place stupid allen and phillip almost broke it down man they     
__label__label1 Well I'm a bit nervous about this. Not that I really have any reason to be nervous, but college in general has been all new to me and a bit scary and overwhelming. I'm really tired right now, but I can't go to sleep because I have so much to do. My body is getting so run down. I really ought to take care of myself, I know. Well, I did go to yoga today. Besides, if I go to bed early, my roomie will stay up and make noise, something that makes me unable to sleep. Unfortunately, only I have early morning classes. Not her. But I love PROPNAME. Best friend, ya know. Oh well. I wish I could have more time to study though. Then I would have more time to sleep. Then I would enjoy life a bit more, I think. I liked hearing in Psych today that everyone is stressed first semester of freshman year. I truly did think I was the only one. Well yippee! I'm not alone! Although, I don't think EVERYONE is juggling 00 hours, with work, organizations, and a lot of time-consuming friends! But I guess a lot of people have their own time problems. Like if they are in a frat or sorority or something. Those apparently take a lot of time. That's totally not my kind of thing though, so I'm glad that I'm not doing it. Also, being in sports takes a lot of time I'm sure. Band too. PROPNAME is in band. He says it's a lot of fun, but I think it wouldn't be my thing either. Unless they sang in band. In which case, I would really enjoy it. Or dance. Dance is awesome. I really miss it. But you know, when I went clubbing this weekend, I really hated it. I hated how guys treated me like a piece of meat and basically violated my personal space and being. I felt like crap. I really hated it. And the thing is, I really wanted to hit the library that night, but nooooo, they said I would enjoy the club because it was salsa dancing - one of my favorites. Wouldn't you know it - they had like one salsa song. Man, that was upsetting. It turned out to be a horrible night. I mean, horrible. PROPNAME is going to bed now. That's a first. She ALWAYS goes to bed after me. Seriously, that's a first. I hope I don't wake her by typing. Actually my comp is kind of quiet now that I think about it. Besides, she claims she is not disturbed by little sounds. So good. I don't think it'll be too much of a problem. My head hurts. And this light shining on my keyboard is actually making my fingers hot. That's kind of creepy. I don't think lights are supposed to do that. Oh well. I really have to use the bathroom now. Hah. I bet that's a psychological thing. I only feel that way just because I know I can't leave the computer because I've got 00 more minutes left. How does this thing work? How can this computer tell me what my psyche is like? I mean, its a computer! How is it able to read what I have written, and then analyze it and give me a response? Hehe, maybe the TAs have to stay at the computer 00-0 so they can write in the responses. Hehe. Sorry, Mr. TA. I know that's not funny. Oh my god it's late. I'm talking to the non-existent TA, I'm so tired. Well if it weren't for all that studying I tried to finish, it wouldn't be so late! But of course, even after spending almost every free moment I had today, reading, I still am not even anywhere NEAR catching up in reading! It's all because of that stupid, stupid sociology class I dropped! I'm seriously upset about that! I mean, that class was by far the hardest class in terms of reading assignments. If only I had add/dropped the class sooner, I wouldn't have wasted all of my precious time on that one class. And then I end up switching sociology classes. Man. I make myself so mad sometimes. Well, hey. I am a freshman and new to all of this stuff. I guess it'll just take me awhile to figure all these things out. LOCNAME is so huge. I don't know if I will ever get used to the size. Actually, I'm not sure it's fully hit me yet anyway. But how on earth did I end up here? I was headed for famous, private colleges in the northeast, that were small, which was my main want in a college. Yet I've ended up at the biggest! PROPNAME is calling on my cell. Poor guy. He is had such a rough night. But hey bub. I'm doing my homework right now. I hope he doesn't think that I'm ignoring him. Well I am, I guess. But I do plan on calling him back. Although that would mean sacrificing more sleep, but oh well. He needs someone right now. I think that's also a problem I have. I spend to much time with my friends. Too many friends sometimes. Sometimes it seems like there aren't enough. Strange how that is. Well I know online (AIM) I definitely have enough friends to talk to. That's so hard. AIM always sucks me in because I get to talk to people who live far away and that I never get to see. I waste so much valuable time on that! Ugh. I procrastinate too much. Well, no, that's not true. I spend A LOT of time doing important things. And I guess AIM and hanging out with friends are my way of relaxing and taking a break. Although they really aren't breaks. Because they require so much emotion, and attention, and energy! So then I need even more sleep! BLOCNAME THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I CAN'T EVER GET! Same with in high school! Ugh. I was such an overachiever. All that for nothing though. ORGNAME didn't even look at all the extra work I did. Replacing lunch for a class. Not having any free time because of all the organizations and officer positions. So much going on. And all UT looked at was the fact that I was in the top 0%. Whoopee. Now I'm in. I think that makes UT a lot less prestigious. For that very reason, UT was my backup school. Because it was so easy for me to get into. Ooh, time is almost over. Last thoughts, LOCNAME? No. I keep thinking about sleep. Hehe. I can't get it off my mind. Maybe that's a sign. But I need to call PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME is moving. Did I wake her up? Oh, I can continue? Nah. I think this is enough. Besides, I need sleep! 
__label__label0 Hello, my name is PROPNAME. I felt like I needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and I am not familiar with that person. Anyhow, lets talk about some stuff. Hmm, where should I begin? I was born in PROPNAME. If your thinking this is like a biography, then I think that you will be wrong. However, back to what I was saying. I don't really like traveling to PROPNAME, LOCNAME. I find it kind of boring because I don't have anyone over there that is my age. All of my relatives are much older than I. These people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. Lets talk about my uncle for instance. I will not mention his name, however, he was. I mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. Why would I be interested in going and visiting him unless I wanted some crack or something? He is a liar anyways, and I don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. Speaking of the kind of people I affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, I think that I accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. Had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. However, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, I think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. Anyways, I'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. Lets talk about my big brother. Now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. This is the reason that I look up to him. He knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all A's! I have to admit that I am somewhat jealous. However, he does help me out and gives really great advice. When he tutors me, I feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. Maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how I retain material. He is two years older than me, but I am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. Lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that I feel is so precious to a person. I hated not being respected. It made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and I couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. However, I put an end to all that crap when I joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. I learned how to fight the hard way though. My coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so I just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. I adopted a slugger's style of fighting. The reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. My strength began to get developed when I began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. That year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so I took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. Man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. From then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. I didn't even have to fight anymore! But I kept on because I got too competitive and I kind of liked it. Currently, I'm undefeated in my hometown. However, I was just an average fighter when it came to the Golden Gloves. I stopped when I started college. That's enough of that. My father is the next person I want to discuss. He has worked his way from rock bottom, and I admire that. He slept in a car for 0 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called ORGNAME ORGNAME). He helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). I still love her and all, I just don't agree with anything she does. She seems to have tunnel vision, u know what I mean? Let me explain because my time here is almost up. She is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. Today she seems more like a stranger, cause I don't see her all that much. She didn't invite me to her wedding. My time is up. Talk to u later. Bye 
__label__label0 Ok. I'm here in the ORGNAME building during mandatory study time. I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.   Well. Anyway, let's see what's on my mind. The ORGNAME are really bad. I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and PROPNAME PROPNAME will be fired. He really is an Awful manager. Personally, I liked PROPNAME PROPNAME. Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager. Hmmm. well. my friend PROPNAME PROPNAME, who used to work for the mets, sat down with PROPNAME PROPNAME the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for PROPNAME PROPNAME. They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse. For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather. There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing. Is that a little bit disconcerting. Yes. Oh well. I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time. 0 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track. I just turned my cell phone off. PROPNAME has handwriting that's hard to understand. My battery life remains surprisingly high. Wireless internet is pretty awesome. Wow. This is the first time I've used wireless internet. I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 0 or 0 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 0:00. I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 00 pm. I should have brought those quarters. I knew I should have. But then I would have been late. I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness. Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today. She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today. That's sick. My dads had that car since before I left for school. That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 00 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste. Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet. I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going. I thought Id miss it a little bit. And I kind of do. I miss the actual acting aspect of it. But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all. It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit. It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside. Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories. My finger. No my thumb really itches. I'm thinking I should wash my hands. They feel pretty grimy. I did wash them after I ate that sushi though. The sushi was surprisingly good. On the other hand it should be good if its $0. The smell in the room. Well there is no distinguishable smell. Back in jester though. WOW. That place smells incredibly bad. It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with PROPNAME is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low. I think my 00 mins is up. 
__label__label0 Yeah so I am so stressed right now and I am wishing that I wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress. I could get FAT!!! I don't want to be fat. I mean I know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! Right?!?!? But I am trying to run a lot!!!! That way, I can burn stress and burn calories. EXTRA CALORIES!!! I am having a hard time not getting irritated when I eat a lot. that's weird huh!? That it's when I am hungry that I'm not most irritable. hmmmm well Today when I went running, I realized that I should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when I'm tight. and get this! I've lost 0 lbs since I got to school. But How?!?!? I've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! Oh well. Still I was kind of excited! But I am mad that I haven't started my period yet. My mood swings are terrible and so are again. My eating patterns! And that's when I find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something I don't like. SPANISH!!! UGH! I want to move to LOCNAME and learn it by living with people who speak it! But I really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows English so she is slow to interpret and yet teach. Does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh I've heard that word before. and oh I know what it means! Poof! I mean we have to LEARN something before we can know it. Did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her Mother's womb. NO! She was pottied trained. RIGHT! Well My high school Spanish teacher was horrible and I had the worst experience with that . while I got a great grade, I didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! I mean I am glad I got an A but she didn't prepare me for LOCNAME where my prof speaks in SPANISH all the time. not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! Would I say to a baby. Ok this is how you open your mouth. open it open it. Do you know what I am saying?!?! It kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak English well. they aren't trying to be mean but they may say "HEY HOW ARE YOU" really loudly and you're like "Dude, they aren't deaf! They just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone" Right?!?! grr. So I feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like "MAN this girl is so negative!" Golly, I am right now because I see my Spanish prof EVERYDAY! like I said before. so yeah! uhhhhh well I am excited about this weekend but at the same time I keep thinking of how behind I am compared to everyone else here at LOCNAME, intellectually and academically! I mean I feel so insignificant some times. However I know where I get my wisdom from and that is PROPNAME PROPNAME who makes my knowing God possible! He saved me from the depths of HELL! And even after doubting him so much and having to research PROPNAME' life and creation and all that. I have found that He is the one . He is my sufficiency! I mean who knows more than the God of the universe, the creator of the heavens and I am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly Mentally, emotionally, Spiritually, and Intellectually! I mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the God that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 00 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) There is just so much opposition to him right now. I mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death. well actually God let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but I just want everyone else to know his love and I really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a "bible beating" manner but just to love them through how I treat them. Hopefully. I wasn't too negative for . you know what I'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this. PLEASE LOOK FOR JESUS WITH THE PRE_SUPPOSITIONS that he doesn't exist. expect to find him and I know you will! To his glory alone!  
__label__label1 I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done. I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist. My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to LOCNAME, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment. We went to the Arboretum and looked around. Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind. This whole not working thing is really different for me. For the past 0 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff. But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 00 hours and just not work. So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out. My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school. There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas. PROPNAME' b-day is Dec. 00 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents. In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of PROPNAME' skiing trip as his Christmas present. But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for PROPNAME, I would just feel weird asking. So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money. Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal. I thought about ORGNAME which is literally 0 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 0am) shift. There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning. So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon. Ok well now what do I write? I have 0 more minutes left. oh some good news. My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio. He's won a car, trips to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME (all paid for trips of course), probably 000 tickets to Six Flags and Sea World separately, and so many concert tickets you wouldn't believe it. He's just really good and always has about 0 radios going at the same time, all on different stations. Ok well I just realized that I only have 0 minute left so I guess I'll wrap things up. I do wan to say that I liked this assignment very much and that we should do all of the. bye.      
__label__label1 Hey you, So far so good, I've got Chem done and don't have to worry about this when I finish typing. wish I could type faster, without the errors too, that'd be great. Like PROPNAME the tiger. Anyways, I'm happy as of the moment. I get to see PROPNAME today, and any day that that happens is a good day for me. (At least, most of the time)  =)   I like rings, that was the only thing I could think of. Sometimes when I write, (normally I write letters/notes to people) in this "stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell) type of writing. But sometimes I try to be random and that just isn't fair to anyone. I  don't like this delete button, (I just don't like the fact I have to use it so much) anyways. I've been waking up on time so far. What has it been, 0 days? dear me, I'll never keep it up, being such not a morning person and all. But maybe I'll adjust, or not. I want internet access in my room, I don't' have it yet, but I will on Wed??? I think. But that ain't soon enough, cause I got calculus homework due by then, and I hate using the library computers or PROPNAME's. She's such a good friend, what would I ever do without her? no one knows. not even me, or you, whoever you are. Sorry I'm not interesting today, must have picked a bad day. The phrase "academics first" just seems to be such a lie. Cause everywhere you go, it seems that "athletics is first" or at least that's how it is in high school. Where you're AP physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 0 class every week, (and you only have 0 or 0 classes a week to begin with) anyways. it's a pet peeve of mine. What others do I have? I'm not sure at the moment, I'm not sure about a lot of things though. PROPNAME is always saying "you don't' know a lot do you?" and it's true, cause when I don't' know, I don't know, and I admit it. I wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday. I always wanted to see if I could beat one. But I can't lie very well to begin with. Can't lie to Mom, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. but everyone else I can pass a few things by. By the way, (there's is nothing to add on to that, it was just what I thought) That's what you get when you assign this type of assignment. but I'm not complaining, I really enjoy it. it lets me think. cause when I think in my head, it doesn't' really work, I still don't know what I'm thinking. but when I write it, then I can at least see what I'm trying to think. My finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing. I must sound like a hick when I talk/type. but that's okay, cause I'm Texan and if that's what it takes to be Texan, then so be it. Damn don't' I sound spiffy. (not really) don't' know why people (PROPNAME) hates LOCNAME so much. I mean, common on! It don't ever get cold. That's the best part. (well it does sometimes, but not as much as other places)  Finish. I type what I read, and then go from there. Can you find the "finish button". Oh, yesterday I had the overbearing urge to watch the "fox and the hound". Why? I don't' know. Don't' care to much either. "Hi I'm Copper!. I'm PROPNAME. " One D or two. I don't' know. Don't' think I care too much either about that. What do I care about? Can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there is something. PROPNAME, grades. (PROPNAME's my Boy friend by the way) Look, there's that phrase, "by the way' again. BTW. Blah. that always reminds me of PROPNAME, (my friend, happy PR chick) "Blah" does. She says it a lot, and now I'm saying it a little more. Hmmm. 0 mins!   The brisket will be ready in 0 hour!. sorry that commercial always pops up in my head when I start counting down. Down the hill, over the hill. Where's grandmother? Who knows? I guess I Don't. Do you? Good question. bye for now, farewell. Godspeed. PROPNAME! Bye. ~ME. Oh I didn't know that we could keep going after the ending. I was all prepared to stop and all. Well I'd keep writing, but I'm sure I have stuff to do, and this ain't ever going to be read anyways. so adios amigos!. ~ME Man, I type slow.  
__label__label1 I'm feeling a little stressed right now. I have two tests coming up in about a week and I'm kind of behind on my reading. There is so much stuff to take care of now that I am out on my own. It makes me miss my family; I'm feeling kind of homesick right now. When I woke up this morning I found myself crying. I'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me. It just happens to be my friend's brother so I'm worried about what I should do. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it and I just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me. But, I did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, I'm glad I had someone to talk to.     I'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but I'm not sure because I think I need to stay and study. But, I think I'm going to go anyway because I need a break and I need to feel more involved. Hopefully some people will go. I wonder what I should wear. I want to go shopping, I'm getting tired of always wearing the same things. It kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room. There are still boxes everywhere and I feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but I just don't feel like it. I keep hearing door open in the hall, I wonder if my room mate is back. It's kind of awkward with her here. I don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative. I still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night. Oh well.      I'm watching this movie on TV about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing. I mean I know I'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often. It makes me feel out of shape, I hope that I don't gain a lot of weight because I'm not working out as much. It felt so good to be back in class the other day. I love the Modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free. I guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and I'm one of the most experienced in the class. That kind of makes me relax because I don't get as nervous as I do around all the good dancers in the other classes. I get so nervous at auditions. I don't know how in the world I'm going to get into those major's dance classes. Then what am I going to do?        My RA just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie. I feel kind of stupid going because I've already been and my friends aren't going. But, oh well, I guess that I will just go. I feel like I need to meet more people. The only people I've have hung out with while I have been here are LOCNAME people. I thought I was going to get away from all that, but I don't know. I don't know what to write anymore. I'm thinking to hard about this and I know I shouldn't be. I should just type whatever it is that I am thinking.      The time is almost up. It went by surprisingly fast and I kind of enjoyed doing it. It actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. It's weird how writing can do that; Professor PROPNAME did mention that in my class. I guess it really is true. I feel like I should have an ending to this. But, I guess not. I guess your thoughts never really end. It kind of makes me nervous when I can't think of what to write. What does that mean?  It's kind of like when I blank out talking to people which I seem to do a lot. I'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. I wonder what the point of it is. 
__label__label0 As I sat down to start typing, my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment. A lot of times, I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings. To be perfectly honest, I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like, all the good times, all the bad times, the lessons I've learned and through which ways I learned them. I must say I am definitely a thinker, and someone who dwells on the past. Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time. I really miss my ex-boyfriend, who was also at one time my best friend. It's like I am missing a huge piece in my life. I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time, thinking what if, and if only I had done this differently. The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently, I guess the feelings just weren't there anymore and the basis of our at one time Ð great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us. Yay, my favorite television show is on, well one of them anyways, 0th Heaven!  From watching that show, I become relaxed and more open-minded. The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts, very useful in life and this day in time. I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much. However, watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but I know if I eat, I will get sick to my stomach. Eating is a major thing to me, partly because I am very self-conscious about my weight. Up until I got into high school, I never worried a whole lot about what I looked like or weighed, but freshman year hit me and I became paranoid. I saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting Caught doing what I had been doing. Of course my parents were disappointed, but they didn't get mad at me, they were just worried. I saw a psychiatrist, a counselor and a Dietician. The psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field, but my counselor, she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth. In fact, it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist; however, she does not know that. I would really like to one day become a child psychologist. I have always been interested in helping children. Hmm, I do believe the chicken nuggets I am fixing in the oven smell so good. I cannot wait for this weekend to come; I am going back home to see some friends and I think my friend PROPNAME and I are going to a football game Friday night, and then Saturday night, I get to race, which I am pretty excited about. We didn't get to race last weekend because it got rained out, which sucked, but I got to hang with my friend later that night, so it was okay. Wow, I just realized that I went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend/best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun I had from the previous weekend, and I just remembered about my hand. There is something wrong with it and I'm not sure what it is, but it hurts. I have a bump on it and every time I move my wrist downward, something pops over it to the left and when I bring my wrist back up, that thing pops back over to the right. It is really gross and hurts, but luckily, Friday, when I go back home I am going to the doctor to get it checked out. It's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you don't even realize it. Wow, its been over twenty minutes already and it doesn't seem like I have typed very much.  
__label__label1 This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to LOCNAME LOCNAME I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in LOCNAME - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life. 
__label__label1 I hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed. I'm such a slow typer. Maybe I should take some sort of remedial typing course. I wonder if they have those at LOCNAME. It's weird how stressful this is I have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that I'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. The copying machine behind me is irritating, I wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though I've only been here for ten minutes. Has it only been ten minutes?  Damn, I have to be in here for at least another ten. I'm so hungry, I wonder what I should eat when I'm done with this. For me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food. I don't have much money and I certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen. Whenever I get hungry I have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen. I miss PROPNAME food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student ID I could eat as much as I wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed. I should make more friends who live on campus so I can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food. Wow, my twenty minutes are up. 
__label__label0 I just read in PROPNAME PROPNAME's Understanding Human Nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood. And I consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. Now, I feel the only way I can attain happiness is to create something. To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. I need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. Now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, I turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which I can empathize and understand. My hunger for reading is insatiable. Everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, I want it all. I want to absorb it so that I don't miss an ounce of life. I want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after. And in all of this, with all the knowledge, as I absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, I feel great anxiety in that I have not made a contribution of my own. Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. My passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. Several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. I can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. The worlds I put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness. I am always looking forward to what I will be, what I could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions. And it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge. And I think back to my early life. My parents. Childhood. When everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that TV show that I've waited for all night. These were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. It makes me so tired to look forward. To never be now. My parents were demanding. Good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. Always left behind in someone's expectations. Enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. I loved them then. Cherished them. Everything I did was to attain their approval. Then I would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. An ovation of some sort. I need approval. I still do. My father was a loner, and now I am a hermit as well. He never shared his thoughts. Compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house. I made up games to express myself. My imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books I read. The stuff everyone else hated. The big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. When people were still learning their multiplication tables. Science fiction. Fantasy. Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. And I wanted to escape. Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. Still not good enough, because no one would share it. They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. I just wanted to be alone. With my books. My imagination. And I've never had a close friend, because I was always so afraid of betrayal. So afraid that I would be cast out, and many times I was, when I just wanted to think. Now I don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. I hope for someone who can share my mind. Someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.          
__label__label0 This writing assignment seems a little silly. I mean I'm probably going to spend the first 00 minutes of this thinking about the actual assignment and that doesn't seem very interesting. Actually I'm already thinking about something else. I can't wait for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. We keep forgetting to buy tickets, I need to write that down. I highly doubt it will sell out but I want to hurry up and buy them. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so good. I can't wait to see him. We definitely need more decorations in our room. Fifty percent of our walls are still blank and its sort of depressing. Maybe that poster sale is still going on. Maybe I'll have my mom send some of my posters from home. I need to remember to call my mom later. I wonder if she misses me a lot. Oh god, it's only been 0 minutes. This is getting a bit boring. I really hope surprising PROPNAME was a good idea. I just hope PROPNAME doesn't give it away. Hell, I hope I don't give it away! I wonder if I'm doing this assignment right. oh well PROPNAME said himself that no one was probably going to read it. I need to do some calculus after this. I'm so pumped I actually understood it today Hopefully it'll stay like this. I'm so worried about the tests in that class. Ill be so pissed if that class brings down my grade. damnit I keep hitting something that makes the cursor jump lines its so annoying. I just love PROPNAME's voice, its so soothing. Its hard to write as you think. My thoughts are moving faster than my fingers. I hope the other surveys I do online aren't as stupid as the one I just did. I'm happy I guess, though, that it was so hard to name things I was dissatisfied with in my life. I couldn't even think of ten. I made up half of them. well not exactly made up but they weren't things I was actually stressing over. Was that even close to being grammatically correct? 0 minutes 00 seconds. ahhh I hope this weekend is fun. I'm looking at the football stadium out my window. I'm excited for my first UT football game ever. It better be good. I hope our seats are good. I wonder what PROPNAME's sister will be like. hopefully fun and easy to talk to. I hope I meet a lot of people at the meeting I'm going to tonight. Hopefully guys to be exact. Although I bet its going to be a lot of chicks since its the university democrats. I hope not everyone is a hippie/chip on their shoulder/ socialist type. I mean I hope they're intelligent and not just the "being different for the sake of being different type" 00 minutes. half way there Yay! I'm really worried about PROPNAME I hope she finds her dream job soon. I hate seeing her depressed because I know she is but she doesn't talk about it. I hope her and dell are working out. he can be so oblivious sometimes. Aren't most guys? My first instinct is to treat this like an essay and explain who I am talking about but I don't think this is supposed to be like an essay. What the hell would a shrink get from reading this crap? It can't be very interesting to anyone else. I need to go DVD shopping, our DVD collection is seriously lacking. I hope raising our beds isn't that hard. we definitely need a change in our room. I think I want another bowl of lucky charms but I suppose I should finish this thing first. 0. 00 for a box of lucky charms! what a rip. I guess I should have know Cypress would be like that. I should ask PROPNAME if she wants to go to the grocery store tomorrow. It sucks not having a car down here. I miss my jeep. Its going to feel weird to drive when I get home. I can't freaking wait!! 0 more minutes. I guess its going pretty fast. This thing just seems like a waste of time but I guess it must have some purpose if we have to do it. I actually need to finish reading for this class. can't forget to do that. wow looking at what I've wrote my thoughts seem pretty disorganized. Hmm what does that say about me? I think being a therapist would suck. I wouldn't be able to listen to depressed people whine all day long. wow that sounded terrible. But I suppose its true. Maybe I'm just not patient enough 0 minutes I need to figure out how my scanner works. I need to take pictures so I can send them to my family. my fingers are starting to get tired. I've typed a lot. I still haven't found light bulbs for my stupid ORGNAME lamp. Maybe we can go to target tonight I think my punctuation and spelling as gotten worse as I went along. oh well. I think he said that we don't need any of that. 0 minutes Thinking about my thoughts is hard, I'm like freezing up. I wonder what would happen if I hit the finish button now. I'm not going to try it because after all of this I want my credit for this assignment! I wish I was disciplined (spelling??) enough to keep a journal. It would be fun to go back and read stuff like 0 years later. I always start it and never pick it up again. I wonder what that says about me? I'm busy. ohhhh 00 seconds! I wonder what the ORGNAME meeting will be like. hopefully nice people will be there I wonder how much of a commitment it is. hopefully  
__label__label0 I am overwhelmed with lots of work. Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way. I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session. I need to call PROPNAME and see if he wants to go see PROPNAME in College Station this Sunday. I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in LOCNAME and spend time with PROPNAME and study Saturday. I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that. The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns. Last year they would start the mowers at 0 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me. There is a party on 0th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going. I don't want PROPNAME to go to that party in LOCNAME LOCNAME because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable. This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party. That sounds a little bit like high school to me. The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far. I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak. There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk. We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves. I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature. They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words. I  love PROPNAME PROPNAME, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says " oh, their just words". Its great, I love it. I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss PROPNAME at home. I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies. I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you. I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own. Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy. I hate this place so much sometimes. there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me. Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it. It is so old fashioned. I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades. yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester. I had a full day of academics. I started around 0 and didn't finish till around 00, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep. But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore. I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know. I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while. I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself. Last year I gained like 0 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it. I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger. I wont go home until ORGNAME v ou so I won't get it until then, damn. I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 00's and 00's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me. Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 0 or something, that would be nice. 
__label__label0      How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework. This week is going to be pretty busy. It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. All the teachers should use the same service. This would make it much easier for students to keep up. My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology. I need to find out what I missed. That class is going to suck. I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away. I hate writing. I hate typing. It is hard to write down everything you think. Our minds work 0 or 0 times faster than one can type or speak. So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 0 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. I'm glad my spider bite went away. It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it. They gave me a shot in my ass. It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. It just sucked that it was on my face. It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days. Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. I spend much time alone now that I moved away. Luckily I enjoy being by myself. It is nice to have the peace and quiet. The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know. I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played. I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. It seems barbaric to use ones instincts  
__label__label0      last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 0 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 00 hours but I'm just taking 00, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank PROPNAME center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el PROPNAME. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 0 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that. 
__label__label1      I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal. You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about. I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out. 
__label__label0 I'm still trying to figure out why I always procrastinate. I think I like to work under pressure, I have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. I wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. I hope the second because I have never been one to study, and I would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? I thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, I can already tell I'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, I already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life I want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. I'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. I'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. I read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was Satan or the grim reaper or something like that. I think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. I hope PROPNAME wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, I am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. I just believe bush will do a lot better job than PROPNAME, and the whole LOCNAME thing I just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while I don't know everything about it, I was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people I heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. I just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. I wish I could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. I wish I could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but I don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but I don't really know what happened there, I guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. I realized 00 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because I am thinking about how long it is, or I'm not doing an activity I find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 0 or0 then having class at 0 the next morning is not fun, I'm surprised I woke up for it. I missed class the other day when I slept through it and it was at 00. that's just strange, getting up at the 0 one, but oversleeping the 00. I wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor I met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which I would agree with although I haven't experienced life after school, but I think it will be hell. 
__label__label0      So I think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete. It gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads. I probably don't realize some of the things that I think. maybe after looking at this I will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling. I smell food. I just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more. I have this weezer song in my head. I don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head. I hope it gets out fast because it is annoying. my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it. that would hurt. never have I done so much reading as I have done this past week. it is annoying. I do not enjoy reading much. oh well. I guess I have to do it anyway. my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light. the apartment is nice. I get my own room and it is very spacious. I hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock. its bugging me and I think its a result of me typing. yep. I stopped and the ticking stopped. I think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on. how ironic maybe. interesting. it stopped. they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore. ill be right back sorry. blanked out for a second. the days seem to go by very fast. the weekends go slow however. I like the weekends. this weekend should be great because I will go hoome for the labor day holiday. seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy. greek mythology has too many  names to remember even a quarter of them. its very a nnoying. how many times have  I said annoying in my train of thought. a good nap would be nice right now. I like that painting of the melting clocks. its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good. I wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars. its just not worth it to me. I am a very economical person when handling money. sometimes its good and bad. a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though. cooking. I need to start cooking more things. sure the microwave is awesome but I need to expand my cuisine. iron chef. funny show. iron chef should fight emeril. I wonder who would win. they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on Emerils show when he says those things. it will give it an old school flavor. flavor is good. does water have a flavor. is the flavor water. who cares its good when you're thirsty. I just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade. because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff. or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars. ill look into it. my mouth is dry. I oculd actually go for some water right now. my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table. I wish I could fly. I just saw some birds flying. I wish I could do that. where would I go. I'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too. that would be awesome. today is the first day of the rest of my life. that quote always struck me as very cool sounding. is hould really start using my planner to right down what I need to get done. my memory doesn't serve me quite well. I want some of the energy arizona iced tea. I haven't had any for  quite some time. I'm due for some. but I guess right now all I got is water. that will have to do. potpourri is such a weird word. but smells nice so I guess they are even. I bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought. it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much. this is one of the best writing assignments I've ever had to write because there is no structure. I am a poor writer. I should practice and get help. I probabloy won't though. ill just get by onw what I can do. it just isn't my thing. donde esta el biblioteca. I need to work on myh Spanish to. hopefully I won't have to take a Spanish class. that would piss me off. I can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter. it would take me too much time. I think tex mex will serve me just fine. bien bien bien. if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because I'm so itno righting this. I hope that doesn't happen 
__label__label0      Why don't the washing machines ever work in my dorm? I mean I swipe and swipe my student I'd and nothing. Nothing ever starts up. I don't carry change on me just because I know Ill spend it on dumb stuff, so I guess Ill never get my clothes washed. Which is a really strange thing because back home I am so meticulous about being clean and having a something new to wear everyday. I don't really care as much here. I only care when I go out what I have on. This is for the pure reason of wanting to impress males. There is so many cute guys at LOCNAME, going out is soon going to be a problem if I don't get my all my work done. I am so scared of not doing well in my classes. This is the big times. If I screw up here there may be no point of return. Its either do it or get out. There's like 00000 people here who are pre-med and I'm guessing 0000 of them are smarter than me, which really doesn't work in my favor when it comes to getting into med school. Ah, why am I putting myself down!? I can do it. I know I can, I've wanted this forever so I'm not going to just give up. I really loathe calculus though. I work so hard,and then I always seem to screw up the exams. Why? I don't know, maybe I have testing anxiety? Is that really a real thing or is just some excuse I'm making up for my bad testing skills. Well, whatever it is I need to get it under control. My roommate seems to have everything under control. She wakes up, makes her bed, goes to class, does 0 work out classes, eats fruits and vegetables for dinner, studies, then goes to sleep at 00 pm. I'm like "WOW" here's the model student, so of course what do I do? I try to model her actions. Yah, its not working so well. I am just not such a structured person. I do believe I have A. D. D though, or maybe once again this is just another excuse. I just cannot focus on my reading assignments for more than like thirty minutes. What's the deal? I have no idea. Oh I have so much to do tomorrow, so many things to take care of . I need to find out when my old professors office hours are this fall. I really don't want to have to see him again, but its got to be done. Especially if I want my grade fixed. I hated my grades this summer. I can't believe I let myself slip that low. Well its really taught me a lesson. I think. I mean I am actually getting more studying done, or activities persay, such as this writing assignment. But I still feel like the same old me. Gosh, there this amazing jacket I want at the mall. I wish I just had an endless supply in my checking account. But don't we all? Yah good thing I got a new job here. My job is so badass. Wait am I allowed to say ass in a school assignment. hmmmm interesting. Oh well there's no going back now! But I do get paid a lot of money and that helps me a lot, because I am so expensive. If I walk into a store, the only thing I'm going to like I can guarantee is going to the be the most money. My room is so freezing cold. I really need to find out if something can be done about this. It's 00 degrees all the time, I'm sitting here in like my eskimo clothes in the middle of summer in texas. It's ridiculous. I really miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. They had their own thermostats in each room. It was clean. And big. Speaking of san jac. Football season starts Saturday. WOOHOO. I'm the biggest dork, I get so into school events like that. It just feelsreally cool to be a part of something so big. It is sort of like when I'm walking past the tower and the mail bldg. and I look down and see the capitol building. I'm amazing, like "wow, I really made it here!" It's kind of surreal to me, like an out of body experience. Then there is always the kids who make it look so easy to be here and like they don't give a damn, I'm like stop that! Exclamation marks make it look like I'm overly excited or yelling or something. I don't like that so I won't use them any more. Is this 00 min up yet? okay, I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking that. Great now I've fallen into the trap of thinking about thinking of what to write for this paper. I thought all day long about how to avoid this hole. Yah it wasn't doable. Is doable a word? do able. I don't know but I like using it. uhhhh. That's the sound of me going braindead. Well not necessarily, that would mean I was dead and obviously I'm not because duh here I am typing. I just really can't concentrate with my room being so cold. My nose is like an icicle. You know speaking of stream of consciousness, I have always wanted to read PROPNAME. Isn't that the name of the book by PROPNAME PROPNAME ? Yah I read an excerpt from it and it was very intriguing. They do this whole writing thing a lot better than I do. I'm looking at my writing and I feel that I sound Childish, not intelligent, like I should be dictating more mature words. Oh god there I go trying to sound smarter. I guess all I can do is write what's in my head. This is me, this is it. Only like one more minute to go and thank goodness. I feel like I've been having to force myself to think or something for the last twenty. Plus I've been thinking in like turbo speed. Sometimes I talk like that. Very fast. People can't understand me its horrible. Oh damn my hand hurts so bad. Ok good I am finally. D-o-n-ne. 
__label__label1 I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. PROPNAME, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where PROPNAME decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where PROPNAME PROPNAME's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to LOCNAME this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. PROPNAME came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with PROPNAME, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to PROPNAME and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 0rd floor. We started talking about PROPNAME's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw PROPNAME's ring (which is her grandmothers, PROPNAME did not buy it), PROPNAME told me that it was 0. 0 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose PROPNAME either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. PROPNAME just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, PROPNAME is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 00,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with PROPNAME for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with PROPNAME now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   
__label__label0 I'm thinking about bush and religion. I just had a simi arguement about it. I don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone. country music isn't that bad. I use to hate it in high school and now I've found a liking for it. tomorrow I go to nachadoches to visit friends. I'm looking forward to the driving and getting away from it all. I don't like being stuck down here. my room is really quiet. so is my roommate. we don't talk much. hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit. my legs itch and so does my back. I'm really full. that large pizza was really good. but the sight of pizza would make me really sick. I still can't stop thinking about government. it all just sickens me. I wish there were better canidates to choose from. face itches. I'm actually happy tonite. I got an A on my physics homework. ugh, physics was made by the devil, I swear. its like they don't want you to ever pass that class. leg itches. I'm a little stressed though. my shoulders and neck are all tight. I think its because of my whole financial aid deal. hopefully it will all be in by tomorrow so I can have some money for this weekend. arm itches. I really like country music. stomach itches. I miss old friends. maybe ill try to fix that this semester. get back in contact with old friends or try to stay in contact. I need to stop missing calculus class. its not like its hard. I just need to go and pay attention. I need to shave. I just need the time to do it. it takes forever. my chair is comfy. I don't like how my monitor is set-up. I wish I didn't have to turn my neck to look at the monitor. I wonder who is winning the patriots/colts game. I hope the colts win. I don't want to see the pats win anymore. I really like the underdogs, except when its UT playing. got to support the home team. astros finally lost a game. 00 straight and then a lose. hope they won the second game of the doubleheader. now I see why I people don't like country music, it puts you in a more mellow mood. not sad but not happy. more of a reflective mood. man, this summer was awesome. I can't wait til next summer. college intern at cypress united methodist. 000 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today. some people from the mission trip knew her. its so sad to be taken at such a young age. texas better beat arkansas Saturday. ill be pissed if they lose again to them. I itch a lot. my beard especially. that's why I need to shave it. ugh, 0am class tomorrow. I thought freshman year was going to be the only year I had them. oh well, the class is easy and entertaining. I can't wait for this to be over. I really wish me and my roommate would talk more. it gets kind of akward in here when we are just sitting at our computers not talking to each other. I need to excercise. I'm feeling lazy. I want to play raquetball. it was great when I hit ash in the head with the ball and then when I fell on my butt when trying to serve. great times. my beard still itches. I think I'm going to go shave soon. its driving me nuts. this is a lot like writing in a journal. just a lot more random. but being random is fun, it throws people off.      
__label__label0 At 000 I should be done writing this paper!!! I am so excited that I get to go home and see my man today. So my body really hurts right now but I feel great because I have worked out every day for like the past week and now I think I am addicted to working out. it gives me such a rush and whoa!!!!! someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me. I hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating. We have designated quiet hours in the dorm AND THERE THEY GO AGAIN!!! no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala I really feel like dancing I think it would be cool it is funny how my typing can't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all I can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it is that I have to do it for 00 minutes which I originally thought would be a short period of time but I look at the clock right now and it says 000 which means it is time to smoke. Lol that is if I smoked weed which I don't I actually find that to be so stupid. why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life. Sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have. psychology is such an interesting major. I just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems, surprisingly, like it will be a lot of fun! I am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that I can cut it I just hope I maintain my GPA and can be like what now! I love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once I finish it is the best feeling kind of like the "high" I get when I exercise I need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale I am excited to be going home to see my b/f but I really don't want to see my family that is probably the one thing I don't miss all that arguing I can't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me is my relationship with my man. he is older I know and I do love him or at list I think I love him and I would never want to hurt him , but I am scared about settling down after college for so many years I saw college as being the perfect time to party and meet boys, but now it isn't like that I LOVE TO FLIRT but I have someone that cares about me and that I care about but I just don't know to I want to settle down with someone that doesn't even have a high school diploma. I'm scared he's going to end up using me or something stupid like that. I know that is mean but so far he doesn't keep his promises to me and he lies and I pay for EVERYTHING but it doesn't matter he  will pay me $000 I think I have spent over $0000 on our relationship. Going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks. Oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 00 minutes of my life I am starting to get typer's cramp. Is that possible? well staring at this screen sure isn't helpful at all!! I am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first I have to wait to finish this paper THEN I got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile. I wonder what I'm going to wear I want to wear my brown shoes but do I have anything natural colored to go along with it I have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm I really should look would white go ummm I need to paint my toenails!!! I can so do that when I get back from eating actually I think naw I do them when I get back look only 0 and a half more minutes I think my roommate is back nope someone else I wonder where she is because her class got out at 0 but normally she comes back early. I really hope I make the crew team I think that would be so cool. I want to make a team And feel special just something else to tell myself that I can do it everyone keeps saying because I am tall but it will be a whole new experience because I know nothing about the sport man I need to brush my teeth what can wear damn I got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that to the list so many things to do this weekend I think I'm going to take summer courses yay! almost finished 0. 0. 0 
__label__label0 Today has been so uneventful. I just accidentally pushed the finish button on this thing and I hadn't typed a thing. My roommate has her volume all the way up on her computer and is IMing people and it is quite annoying. *Bahhhring!* Ugh. I just watched this movie that I completely did not understand. I'm not sure exactly what was going on the whole time. Something about this guy who was really screwed up and then he killed his mom. But she wanted him to. Weird. I'm so tired right now, but I have an early 0 o'clock class. I have towels in the drier. I can't forget to take them out. They're pink and have my name monogramed on them in bright green. Cute. I think, anyways. I can't stop thinking about PROPNAME. I hate being in a long distance relationship. I really do. I saw him just yesterday, and he is coming to visit again on Saturday, but it is still too much time in between. I just miss him so much. He means everything to me. HeORGNAME my best friend. He's my boyfriend. He's everything. I feel like I don't talk to my mom as much as I should, but I really don't feel compelled. And when I do talk to her, she always thinks I am upset about something, but I'm not. I just don't have a lot to say. She is usually busy anyways. Any forty-one-year-old with a kid in college and a one and a half year old, and a live-in, senile grandmother generally has a lot on her plate. And my step-dad, not like he counts for anything. I can't stand the man. And she wonders why I was always miserable when I lived with her. He's such a jerk. But I don't have to live with him now. College life is so much different, but I think I will like it, aside from being away from PROPNAME. I like being on my own and not having to worry about what every one else thinks all the time. Especially my step-dad. I do miss PROPNAME though. Seeing him this weekend was so amazing. I had only been away from him for a week, but it seemed like an eternity longer, I guess because we had taken this huge leap in our lives, moving away and all. I still can't believe it. My life at home was always so monotomous. Get dressed, school, newspaper, home, dinner, PROPNAME, home, computer, sleep. Day in, day out. Now all I do is homework, but still, it's a change (haha, like I ever did homework in high school!) I just realized that I can finally type without looking at the keys. I hadn't known that before. Of course, now that I notice this, I keep messing up, but I guess that's because I am concentrating too hard. I'm trying to teach my mom to type not in all capital letters all the time. That's so annoying. Of course, now she types in all lower case, but still that's a step up from reading EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Caps hurt my eyes and run together. Wow, this really is a random paper. I went to ORGNAME this weekend. I could never go to that school. They have chapel every morning at 0. Wow, that's early. And they have community bathrooms. And, their dorms are small. I like my dorm at PROPNAME. It's nice and spacious, for a dorm anyhow. A whole lot better than Jester. I would hate to live in that cramped little space. Gross. And their bathrooms are gross because ditzy little girls are always getting too drunk and puking everywhere. Oh, the life a sorority hopeful. How I envy puking all over the place in front of everyone. My suitemate puked this weekend because she got too drunk. I've never been drunk, don't plan on being that way. It just doesn't appeal to me. In the cafeteria they had corn nuggets. PROPNAME and I were talking about those just the other day. They used to have them at ORGNAME's ORGNAME and we both loved them, but now they don't anymore. But they have them in the cafeteria! That's about the only decent thing they have. Unless you're into greasy casserole or soggy bagels. I for one am not. I am so sleepy, and I think I might go to bed early tonight. But I need to remember my towels in the dryer. I bet they'll turn the next person's laundry pink, but hopefully not. I've washed them before. I need to call PROPNAME after I get done with this. I told him I'd call when PROPNAME left. PROPNAME's gone. I bet he is busy though. His classes began today. Oh, man. I miss him and talk about him way too much. Is that bad? I really think we can make it though. I mean, if the world is like it should, he and I will be together. We just will. Every time I look down at the beautiful ring on my finger, (on my RIGHT hand), I just know it'll be okay. But I do miss him. I transferred into Comm school today. PROPNAME says I am a Commie now, just like her. I guess this is something to be happy about. This is what I've wanted for a long time. Oh, my time is almost up. Wow, twenty minutes goes fast when you don't talk about anything but yourself. Shameless self-infatuation. 
__label__label0      Ok, writing. I started this a few minutes ago but apparently in Mozilla Firefox the timer doesn't work. Sorry if I end up submitting two essays. Right now I'm kind of hungry. My stomach is growling, I haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning. I didn't use to eat breakfast, but now I do. One minute down. I feel pressured, like I have to continue hitting keys or I'm not doing as well as I should on this writing assignment. Which is strange because all I have to do is write something, anything, and I get credit for it. Is it cheating if I use the backspace key to edit my mistakes?  There are quite a few of them. I probably would type better and therefore faster if I slowed down, which is paradoxical but true. I am also sleepy. Maybe I will take a nap, except I have to study. Hooray. That's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do. I'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday. The description of the rat kind of makes me wish I was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped. Seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant. Maybe in this case it does. I wonder what it's like. Maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical). Maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure. Quite a way to go. I am running out of things to write about and it's only been 0:00 minutes. My mind is becoming a blank. Perhaps I can shove something in there. Nope. Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub. I'm regressing back to childhood, oh no!  Forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what I would have expected. If you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive. I wonder why I keep bringing up images and thoughts from when I was young?  Perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what I learned yesterday or what I see on ORGNAME. ORGNAME. I do not like that channel at all. I do not like it in a boat, I do not like it with a goat. I do not like it, PROPNAME I Am, I do not like ORGNAME ORGNAME. The channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against. At least they encourage people to vote. That's a positive message coming from a negative source. I guess no one or nothing is truly evil. Well, nine minutes gone. I'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as PROPNAME put it. Like everything in my mind has already come out and I'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw. Of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and I suppose it's the same with the mind. One thing I never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness. In the textbook it seems like a step is skipped. An analogy can be made (and has been, I assume) between the mind and the computer. One could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text. But the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data. Where are the programs in the mind?  It's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement. Where is the software?  I'm just rambling now. Although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it?  Ha ha. I tried to read the book House of Leaves, I was told it was brilliant, but you know what?  It, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks. It's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it. Speaking of which, Hello, whoever is reading this!  I hope you're having a wonderful day. Although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day. Still, someone's got to do it, right?  Someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it. Then the worker loses their job. Which is better, I wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all?  Some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us. We will become like PROPNAME's Solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population. Eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human. Or maybe not. What will be the point of civilization then?  What is the point of it now?  To keep people happy?  Great job so far, I must say. Nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals. More and more chemicals, pills, etc. to cure the imbalances in their head. They should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware!  Biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far. People who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them?  Eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed. Quite a while to be writing. You know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short. I love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it. If only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention. It all deals with people's perception anyway -- I bet there is a way, somewhere. Although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea. Speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up. It's been a pleasure. 
__label__label0      I'm really happy I started my workouts today even though I feel awful right now. I need to get back in the shape I was before the marathon. I don't really feel like going out tonight at all but I have to go because I promised my friends. I'm not really big into parties I think they are sort of stupid I'm always really uncomfortable because I don't really know that many people except the guys they go with and I feel really weird just following them around. oh well it doesn't really matter I guess everyone there is drunk anyways I really want to go home this weekend and see zach I really miss him a lot I wish we could have both gone to the same school but we Couldn't. thanksgiving is really far away and I don't know if I can wait that long to see him. We have been friends so long it feels really weird not seeing him everyday there are some good things about being here I never have to see ross or trevor I hate those guys. I would like to lie and say they taught me something about myself balhaablaha but zach was right I never needed either or them. Dating zach is so weird but being friends first makes it more special. I really miss PROPNAME I can't believe she is going into the army in two days LOCNAME is so far away and I can't believe I won't see her for two more years. PROPNAME is at texas state with nathan and says she loves it I hope her and blake get back together she just loves him so much I feel bad that she's sad about them breaking up with him and I don't really know what to tell her. I miss the basketball team so much I have pat and kellan here with me but zach and maury and matt and nathan and dotun are so far away I hate it I guess maury and zach aren't that far away dallas isn't that bad. Its sad though I won't be able to go back and see ben and dipot and my brother play since my parents moved I'm sad I won't be able to go to reno with zach anymore but I guess he decided to stay home iwht me for christmas so PROPNAME and dotun will go by themselves without us christmas is going to be so fun with him I know zach feels like he will never mean as much to me as ross but I feel the same way about amy I think we both know what we have is different but I really don't like talkinga bout it with him I would rather just ahave fun together like we always do we know what we are to each other and I don't think we need to keep talking about it. I'm over ross for good this time same with trevor and no matter how many times they ask me I won't get back together with them I don't think zach believes me though I don't konw what I can do to make him no so insecure about us I don't know whatever hell figure it out eventually. Its hard to talk to him though I could never hurt him though I just know him to well everything about him we grew up together so I know all the things that hurt him and he knows all the things that hurt me so I don't know if I could ever accidentally hurt him or say anything that would make him sad because I know exactly what those things are. He knows those things about me too I think its better this way to know everything all the wounds a person has  when you are with tthem there ar eno secrets between us because he was the person I always told me secrets to and he is still that person I go to so I don't understand why he thinks I will break up with him inever will he will have to break up with me because I refuse to hurt him I would never cheat on him eitheri love him too much and I respect him too much I think it is just awful when people cheat on each other I don't think its the worst thing you can do but it is still terrible you should care enough about the person to end it before you deliberatly hurt them that is just mean and selfish I don't think I could ever do that to anyone but especially to zach god I've tlaked about him way to much I think but who care nobody will probably ever read this I miss him a lot I think its weird what happened alst weekend going up to visit him will be awesome in two weeks I can't wait I miss him so much he is really starting to look like ben I  
__label__label0      I hate escalators. Don't know why. I've always just hated them. Or maybe I'm afraid of them too. My right foot feels really numb. And not Comfortably Numb like that PROPNAME PROPNAME song. Just numb. Pink Floyds OK, somewhere up there with Verve Pipe and Nirvana. There's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me. He's wearing a fedora that's covering his eyes. He looks cool. Fedoras are cool. I wonder why guys stopped wearing them. I mean they look cool, especially in those old film-noir movies like The Big Sleep. I have no freakin' idea what that movie was about. The plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was OK. Some girls next to me are chattering/giggling. I hate it when people giggle that way. Its annoying. I hope I don't giggle that way then I'd be annoyed with myself. I wonder what it would be like to be somebody else. I mean what if I was the guy resting back on that couch? Would I be the same person in someonelse's body? Or someone different. I wonder if a different body makes you be different. I wish I had my CD player with me. Life sucks without it. Then again, it'll suck either way so I guess the CD player doesn't make much of a difference. I'm humming the tune to Something Stupid. Cute song. Though what the hell was up with PROPNAME singing that with his daughter? Freak. But he's a cool freak. The weather here is always so damn sunny. I don't like sunny weather, it gives me a sun burn. I like it when the sky's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain. That's my kind of scenery. Always has been. Don't know why. I'm yawning now, even though I'm not all that tired. I wonder what the girl next to me is thinking. She looks like she's in really deep thought. Maybe she's thinking about lunch. No, lunch is over. Dinner. Yeah, maybe she's thinking about dinner. I can't wait until this week is over. What time is it? There's never a clock when I need one. Life's inconveniences. I'm looking at my wrist, at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it. Hope I'm not late to class. Then again I was early to class the other day because I had my watch on upside down. My nails are too big, I need to cut them before I get a hangnail or something. My foots still numb, I wish the bloody thing would wake up since I've got a class to get to. I miss my friends back home. Hell I even miss my paranoid, stark-raving-lunatic of a mother. How pathedic. . I need a new pinky ring, this ones all rusty and broken down but I'm too attached to it. Its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway. Hey fedora-guy just woke up. Yeah, he's stretching his legs now. I wonder if my leg will ever move now. I wonder why people can't fly. I mean who wants cars and airplanes/jets when you can fly? That would be cool. I wish I could fly. But I wouldn't want wings, those would be too annoying to take care of. I also wish I could play the piano. But I guess desire never equals talent. Reminds me of LOCNAME. PROPNAME was a great movie. Great story. Fedora-dude is gone now, some other guy has taken his seat. He's not wearing a hat, but its OK. This guy's got long eye-lashes and a pointy nose. Pretty cool. I wonder if someday I'll wake up and everything was just one big nightmare. That would be great. I could start over. But knowing my luck, I'd just make the same mistakes. 
__label__label0 it is a beautiful day outside and I hope to enjoy it as best I should I am listening to one of my favorite bands. this song matches my mood perfectly. I feel like I should be doing something with my life and I'm not, and it's very har to get along in this university without feeling lonely now and then. I find beauty in very conventionally ugly things and this is why I love photography so much. the pictures I have up on my walls reflect my personality a lot. there are so many aspects of me that people never get to see and it hurts when they judge without knowing me personally. I see in color in the sense that I see the most vibrancy and brightness in everything. my room here is finally starting to smell lik ehome and that's one of the first things I notice when I come in. I'm glad I ended up at ut. I thought I was kind of chickening out by coming here. it's the only place I applied to. I'm a freshman this year and I really hope to get out in 0 years, since I have 00 hours of credit from exams. I hope I can get out in 0 years because I want to feel good about myself and not feel inferior to my peers. I have a lot of issues about who I am and that's why psychology fascinates me so. I understand a lot of who I am more than most people my age. I'm feeling very wise right now and although my boyfriend is a year older than me, I sometimes feel years older than him. I might want to marry him someday and I worry about that. I miss the way things were 0 years ago when I was carefree I feel very burdened and I sometimes think I'm not experiencing college because I feel that way so often. I've always had so much to do that when I don't, I can't relax and I get really anxious. if I'm not stressed out I think I'm missing something. when I watched president PROPNAME speak last night I cried because I'm so worried that he will be reelected. I am an avid kerry fan and feel passionately about politics and when I hear bush lie and make empty promises and see people believe what he's saying it affects me deeply. I want to make a difference in the world someday. I hope I will grow to be someone great. my past relationships have been sneaking up on me recently an d things on that front are disturbing an dmaking me feel regretful. I there are some things that I remember so perfectly about the past and I don't know why they stick out. I know that there is something special inside me and I hope I can do something great in this world. I remember going to europe two years ago and feeling so happy with myself and who I was and I don't have any clue about that anymore. I find peace in knowledge. wondering stresses me out. I used to write a lot of poetry and I still feel just as expressive but now the words don't flow as well. I think that as I've grow up, my poetic naivete has faded as has any talent I had. I feel bery inferior to people that don't know me they look at me like I have no self worth and it bothers me. I am a government major and a psych minor but some people think because I'm in liberal arts I have no direction in my life and that is so frustrating. it frustrates me when people think I am stupid. I have almost no tolerance for ignorance yet I get mad when people do that. I am very analytical, mayb eoveranalytical, and its gotten me into a lot of trouble in my life I miss conor and what we had a few years ago and I miss our friendship I need to feel safe and comforted in order to be successful and I am very dependent on other people in my life to do that for me. when we weren't 000 miles apart I miss justin in many ways and that bothers me he was the most detrimental person in my life and still is so far and last night I was thinking about those three days that were the worst in my life and there is only 0 thing I can do to get past that. I don't know if I will ever. one of my main goals in life is to be understood and I feel very misunderstood by people that don't take the time to get to know me and I feel that the first impressions I give are not very accurate. I am very emotional and I know that just thinking about certain things will make me burst into tears it makes me feel inferior to do that. I feel guilty when I cry because things could be a lot worse. I want this world to improve and I want to help it do so. I need a lot of love. ramon and I have something really special he makes me feel so loved we have been together for two whole years and I want to be with him forever I want to make him happy and I want him to make me happy until we are old and I want to share everything I have with him. I wasn't sure about that until recently but now I feel more passionately about our relationship than I ever have. sometimes I cry out of neither sadness nor happiness and its hard to explain to anyone else it feels like I cry out of understanding a complex emotion that I never was able to before. if a song really touches me and I connect to it I will almost definitely cry. I think that makes me special. I think I am more compassionate than most people. music is one of the most powerful mediums of communication there is it makes me feel freer than anything else except possibly writing. the sound of this song is so familiar and it reminds me of good memories  
__label__label1      Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate PROPNAME woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAORGNAMEIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of LOCNAME LOCNAME called LOCNAME. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 000 student high school!! These 000 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 0 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . "PROPNAME, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) 
__label__label1      I am excited about being a columnist, not because I like the daily texan particularly, although I do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since I can go on to write for the ORGNAME or the statesman once I am out of college and I can get internships at newspapers during the summer so It will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, I'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, I don't know if I can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, I don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but I obviously can't leave them behind and I think I want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean I actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but I still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but I can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all I can do is leave my options open so I can make good decisions later, so basically all I can do is write as well as I can and make good grades, I don't know exactly how to do either but I do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means I need to go to the UTLC finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well I can do on my own, I'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, I'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as I love going to UT home games, an away game means that I can eat while I'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, I can watch it with whoever I want and I don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, I would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, I don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so I don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, I'm a little worried about what I look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot I can do about that before the next game but I'll do what I can, I'm bored with classes already, I havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since I am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so I can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more I do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, I've never lived by myself before and I havent lived away from home for that long, I've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since I don't live in a dorm anymore, I miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so I guess the solution to that is to get things done while I'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, I need to get some groceries, I don't think I know how to shop yet, I still havent made a grocery list longer than 00 items and that's not enough when I go to the store once a week at most, I'm sure things will get easier once I get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but I'm anxious to get to the point where I am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management 
__label__label0 twenty seconds and I still haven't thought of anything. PROPNAME is crazy for taking all those chemistry classes! I couldn't even work on my math problems, and concentrate. I don't know how she makes it all those hours with science and math. We're going to watch that movie tonight, in a little while, so I need to finish my homework pretty soon, and get a head start on the week, so I don't have too much to worry about. I need stop freaking out the ghost in our community bathroom! Those shower curtains don't open themselves! I wonder is molly is going to be happy for me and jen about being the new wing representatives? wow that's a big word. I wonder if that's how you spell it. I need to clean up my room before my roommate throws my stuff out in the hall. Stupid jose can't really mean what he said. He said he's not IN love with me, and just loves me. But I know we'll get back together. I'm sure of that. Now. . Whhooooahhhh I clicked that button too many times. I really hope they don't run out of the poster I want. I signed up to work for 0 hours at the poster sales to get $00 worth of credit for that poster starry night. wow that hairstyle's weird. That guy must work hard to get it like that. maybe I should stop looking out the door. it's too quiet in here, since jen doesn't listen to her music out loud. I love that people miss me back home, and that makes me feel like I was someone back there. the more I look around this room, the more I like the color purple. I remember the superman theme from stucco, and the way PROPNAME looked in his cape. I wish I had my photo album with me right now to show jen. mmmmmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa the eyes of LOCNAME are upon you. . Today's lunch was super cool, because me and jen went back to the buffet, where she saw her friend who also happens to be Hispanic too! I was so glad when I saw Hispanics here. I need to add more people to my yahoo, because I only have four people. I don't know why more people here don't have messenger, like people back home. this is so cool, because it keeps you thinking, and you see it right in front of you. This is so much fun, I should do this more often and then find the pattern of what I seem to think about more often. darn! my time is already running out. this was fun. I'm down to like 00 seconds. I hope I did this assignment right. 
__label__label1 This is what I need to do. Type with my friends in the messenger its really ADDICTING. LMaoOO. Well I love to listen to music. Its really soothing for me and I fell weird with out it. I LOVE TUTY ORGNAME BRazeros Musical( ; ; my favorite group) I wonder when they are going to come back. (this there one of there songs. Lloviendo esta y atra vez de la lluvia te llevas con tigo a la cuidad entera mis lagrimas no miras la lluvia las confuendedn y aunque yo este llorando por mi no te preocupes. Te esperare te esperare aunque no vuelas mas. Llenaste mi rtecuerdos a la cuidad entera. Y aunque yo se que nunca mas tu volveras. " Lagrimas y Llubia by Brazeros Musical. Who did I get backstage. It was all a rush. But am glas I did. I meet one of my favorite groups. They were nice. There performance was great. Although at the end they stinked musty and were all sweaty they were forth it. PROPNAME and PROPNAME were the cutest of them all. I was surprised that PROPNAME recognized me. there is nothing special about me and well. He was remembered how my face looked like. I Hate this song put I cannot tell my roommate its from the 00s or something like that its OLD. "In the car wash. " maybe because I heard it for too long. Its a remix. Its lonely in my room. I have nothing to do but be here in the computer. Reflecting back on high school it was exciting but I wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable. I Made it to PROM Court. I was Beaten by a girl That never attended school. How can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends. We were all great students. And never broke the rules!!! Its beb 00 mins and well I have a million things tuning through my head. I miss my family (as whole) because they went to MEXICO with out me. This the first year they do it and I feel left out. But am having a blast here in the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and I cannot ask for anything better. I Love Austin. This were I been living for 00 years. I think I love music because of this "The Live Music Capital of the World" music was everywhere I turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of ORGNAME. In the Laundry thing and well my mom Loves to dance. Which leaves me think. What am I going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert. I love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more. "the artist" for most part are really down to earth and I look forward to every dance there is. Its Been two weeks since school started, yet our room still STINKS!!!!!! We cannot take the smell out. Being in the ninth floor. We cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of Nowhere land stuck in a Corner were no body comes an visit us. That's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. Its sunny outside its not HOT like it usually is. I love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. That little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. I love that smell of wet grass as well. UMmmmmmmmmmmm. So one did PoPcoRn and I smell it all the way over here. 00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 sorry I got distracted by the timer less then am done. It been distracting since it started 
__label__label1 Well. Actually, I don not know what should I write down here. I think that this can be a very easy assignment, or this can be a very hard assignment. How stupid! Honestly, today, I asked about it to a TA because I could not totally understand what should I do? I knew that there is no topic, but no topic can mean the huge categories. Anyway, this assignment made me confused. But, interestingly, a LOCNAMEn student asked about what she should do for the assignment in the today's class. At that time, I thought two. One is that there is also a person who do not understand the purpose of this assignment like me. And. the other is that "Oh, my god! Don't ask me. Don't ask me. Because I am an international student who came here in America a month ago. So. I am not good at listening to what people say yet, especially in the casual conversation. You know, young American university students talk so fast. Hum~~~ it is a big problem. So, I made her ask the same question three times, and finally, I could tell her what she should do for this assignment. How stupid!! Now. I am in a big dilemma. I have a difficulty keeping up with classes now, but I feel happy and can relax when I meet friends and drink with them. But, I have to study. So, I thought that now, I have to meet lots of friends to learn English instead of only studying in the library to keep up with classes. I thinks it is a great excuse to play. But, what is the priority for me?? Meeting friends to learn English and American culture? Or studying hard to keep up with all classes with no meeting others?? So difficult!! However, I suddenly wonder. Can I deal with both of them perfectly. . . . ?? So confused. Wow, time is almost over. but, I do not much. 00. 00. 00. . . 00. Ok! I have to finish this~~!!  
__label__label0 I finally got to see Matrix: Revolutions. I don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful. It's funny, everyone I've talked to that loved the 0nd one hated the 0rd one and everyone that hated the 0nd one loved the 0rd one. I'm in the latter category. I've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now. I think it might have to do with our expectations. I loved the first one. I was waiting for the second one to come out ever since I heard they were making a trilogy. I had good expectations for Reloaded, and I went to the theatre to see it on opening night and I was disappointed. The interesting thing is that about a month earlier, X-Men 0 came out. I liked the first one a lot, but I wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 0nd one to come out (like how it was with Reloaded). My expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent. I hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect. When I went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away. After about an hour and a half had gone by, I checked my friend's watch because I was worried the movie would end soon.         Enough Matrix talk. I just got back from LOCNAME, and I got to see PROPNAME PROPNAME. Hmmm. It might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an "illusionist" and all. I saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that I'm very proficient in visual media. I think it might be because I've seen all of those Goddamned behind the scenes "documentary" stuff for the extended versions of Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. In a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use. Maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface. I had a point to this. PROPNAME. Yeah, it was fun. I found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological "illusions. "  What I mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show. Again, it might've been better if I had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks. The older audience members must have been stumped.          PROPNAME's very cute. He's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, I don't know. Next hour at the most.  Whenever I'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my CD book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot. Instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me. Big difference!  Before I'd moved the computer onto where it is now, I had it closer to the bed on PROPNAME's desk. PROPNAME would spend most of his time while I was on the computer on the corner of my bed. Er, sorry. AMANDA'S bed. I still can't get over the time when I talked to her (a very rare time since the Kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and I took her old apartment) and I was so excited that I'd bought this silky linen for, and I quote, "my bed. "  "You mean MY bed," she said. "I bought it. You're only keeping the things in that apartment while I'm gone working on the campaign. "  Bullshit. When we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, "Oh, I have to go now. I need to go to my mom's bed. or what I should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though I sleep in it every night. "  Yeesh!  She's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent. I hope she'll get over it, because I really resent the fact that she believes I'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers. For some reason that really bugs me. PROPNAME's awake and about now. It's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while I'm typing. My times up anyway, so tah!
