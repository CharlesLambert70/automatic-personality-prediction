__label__label1 The lights  are all out here in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Thank goodness PROPNAME has  this lap top so I can do this assignment. I still have to do the other one too. They both are due Friday. The lights just came on. I'm so relieved because now I can feel the air conditioning. I'm a little bit off the assignment because PROPNAME is watching me. PROPNAME says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. I don't really know. Tonight I need to go to the theta house and study. We have to get certain amount of hours done . I don't really want to read anymore of the LOCNAME LOCNAME by PROPNAME. It is like a history book. It  makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it. The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains. The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. I guess that's how it works. Right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. I have about 00 pages  to read tonight. It is a little overwhelming. sometimes I get behind  and feel real guilty about it because I want to keep up with all my classes. I need to do my math homework too. I kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then I'll never get up. My bed is sooooooo  cozy. I just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. I kind of feel like watching Backdraft. Whichever PROPNAME guy is in it is really good looking. He reminds me of this LOCNAME guy that is living in  towers. He is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. He walked us home the other night from the LOCNAME house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. I was thinking this guy is too good to be true. But then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. I don't think I would like to get in the middle of that. If that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. Because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. But he is one of the better guys  I've seen around lately. I kind of want to just ver out tonight but I know that I'll feel bad about it later. I'm so into making good grades but I haven't quite gotten into the hang of doing homework in this new setting and everything. PROPNAME just called. I'll be living with her next year. I think it’ll be good. Me , PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. I don't really know her too too well. Seh and PROPNAME are friends. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and I have been hanging out a lot lately. She's so cool. It's really awesome to get to know people from different states and become close friends. She's from LOCNAME. LOCNAME is so random. What is in LOCNAME?  Maybe we'll all go there to see her family sometime. We might go to LOCNAME for The Rice game. Then I'll get to see my little brother. He is so cool. He's growing like a weed right now. It's crazy. Now that I'm gone he is like an only child. I hate that for him. Maybe he likes it a little. He gets all the attention now. I don't want to lose the awesome brother/sister relationship  that  we have right now because I'm 0 hours from home. 
__label__label0 here I am typing this thing for my psychology class. I am typing it for 0. 0 percent  of my grade. this isn't too bad, it could be worse. twenty minutes isn't that bad. however, I’d rather be playing chess. I don't want to think about school. I just got out of summer school. I took cs000 computer organization and programming and m000k differential equations . that was a rough summer. I almost  reconsidered my degree, but I've come to far now, so I guess I’ll finish. maybe  I’ll do a coop this summer , or take ee000 or both, that wouldn’t be so bad,  I need the money and the credit. who knows. I just want to take a break. at least I’m taking interesting classes. all of them are alright. I just got done with my cs000 homework. I’m glad I switched to PROPNAME's class, and got out of PROPNAME’s class. all of the students that are taking PROPNAME are really hurting now. I talked to one of his students, she hates that class. I think PROPNAME's class is alright. oh well. this isn't that bad at all. I need to get a job though . my loan is going to run out on me pretty soon. it's nice to not have to work though. I like waking up late on the weekends and not have to get ready for work at 0 o'clock. that sucked. no more restaurants for me. no sirree. I hate working in  the food industry now. that really really sucked. I like the people there. I’m going to miss them. I had a lot of fun, going out, partying, meeting new people. I can't stand the restaurant business anymore anyway. just as soon as you meet people the quit or get fired , move or whatever. and the management sucks. I want to get a more laid back job where all I have to do is be there because the business needs someone there, just to be there. I think ill be a proctor next semester for cs000, I don't know what I’ll do this semester, maybe I’ll ask my mom for money. she said she would give me money now that I’m at ORGNAME. oh well . I just want to play chess. I almost got my rank up to 0000, I think I can do it if I pick on the 000 and 0000 crowd. that would be nice. I've almost got  another name up to 0000 and 00+ games. that win I had at the tournament  was sweet . my time for writing this assignment is almost up . hah hah. this is  easy points. I just hope I do well on the tests . I better start reviewing this stuff. I've got the chapter read and 0 hours of experiments done. I just need to  review a little bit tonight . I need to do the vocabulary. I need to do my vocabulary for cs000 too. and review matrix multiplication for m000l. I have to wake up at 0 am . that sucks. but my classes will be over pretty soon. that will be nice. I get out at about 0 o'clock on those days, which is nice, I can take a nap and then study or something, waste time, and then study, or whatever. I just have free time. for now. later it should get harder. I hate thinking about school. I want to play chess or go read a book or go out or something fun. its 0 o'clock . just a few more minutes of this and I’ll be done. jeez this seems like a long time to right  now that I think about it . my hands are getting tired . I wish I couldn't type very well right now. oh well . I’m going to get carpal tunnel from this. maybe not. I don't know. who cares. I think I’ll just finish this thing of with a bunch of . what do you call them. phrases that people. oh yeah. wait a minute, I forgot again. what is it. hmmmmm. oh yeah. cliches, that's it . I can just finish this thing off with a bunch of cliches. waste time. but I forgot any cliches . so I guess I can't finish this off with cliches. but I wish I knew a bunch of cliches to finish this last few minutes off with . that s ok though it's not so bad . I can just let my mind wander like it always does. the count , PROPNAME PROPNAME's dead. bela lugosi's dead. PROPNAME PROPNAME's dead. undead. undead. undead. undead. undead. undead. I’m listening to Bauhaus right now. one of my favorite bands. maybe . I like them at least. I want to get the Fields of Nephilim album. I think they only have one album out. they were pretty good though. almost as good as Bauhaus, or maybe Bauhaus was almost as good as them. it's hard to tell. I like them both a lot. I just need to get the money to buy the album. I hate not being able to get more music. I m addicted to music. I am suffering from CD withdrawal. ah ! it sucks! oh well just one more minute . one more minute of typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typging typing typing  typing and I’m done. bye. 
__label__label1   So far I have been at LOCNAME for I guess 0 school days, and I can already feel myself slipping. School was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. Why can't I go back?  Let’s see. what did I do today?  I woke up around 0 (we have lives around here), and  was bugging my sister to take me to church. I haven't been there since I don't know how long, but I need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and I don't know how it made me feel. I want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. I don't want to desert him, but I don't know what he wants from me and what I can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth I have no idea what I was thinking when I went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. I don't know how I feel about him. I would like to be his friend, but that's it, and I also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing?  Guys. Don't they all suck?  I wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason I am still waiting for him to reply. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. I get really tired and depressed when I think about my ex and I don't know what to do about it. I want to be his friend, but I know he wants more and I don't think I can offer him that. I need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. He comes from a broken home and has a LOT of problems that I don't want to deal with. He's from LOCNAME LOCNAME and asked me to come down for his birthday. Funny I was actually considering it. what's wrong with me?  I called my little sister (00 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. Neither were my parents. I think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and I miss them a lot. I need to come back and visit and I don't think I can do that until Christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than Christmas  break. It really bothers me that I didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but I shouldn't be worried about that right?  I am so unenergized right now. I need to go jogging or something, but it is late. I can't believe PROPNAME PROPNAME died. PROPNAME PROPNAME also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as Princess PROPNAME. So much has happened in my short 00 years life span. I can actually tell my kids that I was alive when Princess Di and PROPNAME PROPNAME died. it seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad?  I just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. I don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to?  my cousin is going through a break up right now and I don't know what I can do to help. I know she can do better than him, but I also know that she likes him a lot. What's a girl to do?  I am really relieved that I don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am I still commenting on that?  I was a lot better before he called. I just wish he could disappear and I don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is?  I think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. I don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and I still have other things to do. thank goodness I remembered about this. I actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that I try to do at least twice a week. I really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 00 minutes so I’m outta here. lan ngoc ngo       
__label__label1 I don't know what just happened, but all that I just wrote for the last 00 minutes just got erased. This makes me a little perturbed, but I don't really care. This just allows me to write even more interesting things. Maybe this time I'll talk about movies. Yeah those bad ass little things that I l0ove ohhhhh sooo much. In fact I'm hoping to film a movie by this years LOCNAME game. that way I can show my best friend who will join us from K. C. Together we made 0 movies. 0 movies for English and two for our own enjoyment. Okay the preview for Scream0 is on the tv behind me and its a little hard to pay attention to this assignment, but I guess this is also part of the assignment. How many people does it take to rip off a football from the bumper a of a frog. jello. jello. retard. Bug women can kick my friend's ass. At least that is what he always says. He says that he is going to start going after those women who could actually kick his ass. Me I'm just going after the beautiful intelligent type. It seems like it is working out thus far, but not from m shoes. 0 women are in my life right now. One is an ex-girlfriend who I was very attracted to, but broke up with me for seemingly no reason whatsoever. I think it was because I became too attached, whatever that means. I guess loving someone too much is not a good thing. That was sarcasm. I really don't think there is such thing as loving someone too much. I do sometimes watch myself when I'm trying to meet a girl. Now I wonder if they think I'm trying too hard. Anyway,  my ex gave me a call and we talked for 0 hours. In the talk I felt like going over there and hugging her right there, but she would be missing out on sleep for her next day. I think she valued her sleep more than me. Well no not really, I think we just weren't mature enough to know how we really felt. I still can't really say whether it was true love since I have never had any other taste of love that I could compare it to. Al I know is that I miss what we had, and I want it back. I thought I was over it. He's 00. I am over it. Today I realized that life is not as complicated as we all make it out to be. It this "real world" that we have made up that keeps us under constant stress. The mind analyzes everything and tries to figure out the real world. It is the heart that I try to follow. The heart  gets past all that which seems and goes straight to what feels right. I believe in that feeling over the appearance of a situation. I have led a very happy life and I think I am doing things right. I jus t recently had to decide whether or not I wanted to be a frat guy. Isn’t it funny that I brought this up right after I mentioned I think I’m doing things right. I take that as a good sign. But now I’m hesitating so I take that as a bad sign. Basically I’m still trying to figure out whether I turned down the frat for personal reason or to please other people. When I did decide to quit the frat I became extremely happy, almost to the point of crying in my car. This was when I came up with this decision on my own outside the influence of the other people I know. Then the damn frat got me to come into their house and talk to me one on one. This showed me all the people that I would be letting down by not joining the frat. I can't stand letting people down. I try so hard to help everyone, but its just impossible. I think the reason I felt like an asshole yesterday was because I have let a lot of people down the beginning of this year. Namely the frat and my brother for not joining the frat like he did. He is trying to live vicariously through me and it is a little annoying. I think I first showed interest in the frat just for his sake. I would like to explain to my brother that we are not alike and that my whole life is not revolved around women and beer, but anytime you talk to m brother he just makes you look stupid and I hate that. I don’t feel like I can explain anything to him unless he already believed it to begin with. I think this is why he became a lawyer. 
__label__label0 Last night I had another fight with my mother. Maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. As far as I can see I have only brought her pain and no comfort. Although she does make several good points about my  unorthodox behavior, ultimately I am a grown man. If I told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time  the result would be ridiculous. Not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where I came from and what I have done. I've got a good job(insurance company $0. 00/hour), pay for my car, attend college,  help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. My mother thinks that my constant ventures  to places she has never been will bring about my demise. Certainly there is no way I can deny about her role in my life. She has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but I don’t see how she can try and write my schedule out for me  according to her opinions. Recently our dog had 0 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. Six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about  keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy I don’t even want. I tell her to give it away and then she  blames for being a cruel person in that we don’t know what kind of person would get it. For a while now I have been looking for a female. And I don’t mean just any ol' girl I can get plenty of those. But a lady who I won't get tired of after the first night in bed. There is  several ladies out there who I would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way I thought. So I just go on  with flirting' around. Most girls I know think that I except something from them, but I'm simply trying to be friends. I guess that’s  the rep I got at LOCNAME high. Maybe because of the people I hang with. Hopefully I've written enough, and if not here are some more  of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. In college I've tried to have different study habits then high school. In high school I could do  nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. Here I know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. I can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of LOCNAME or I might end up with a poor man working for ORGNAME’s or begging for money on the drag. A few days ago I read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind  to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. Interesting idea.              
__label__label0 I'm thinking about PROPNAME and the email he sent. E-mails. How could that be that he loves me. He doesn't even know me?  I should not have gotten so flustered the first time I read the letters. I should not have told anyone. Now he has become a sort of pariah in my mind, a weirdo, an outcast, never to be touched by me. An that was wrong. He was brave and poetic enough to bring tears to my eyes. I didn't tell that to anyone. I only went off on the fact that it "weirded me out" , thus I became the dumb blonde, the snob, simplifying this event into something that was "weird. "  Now, after I have read the letter again I realize how beautiful it is. Yes, he pairs me with his other love, marijuana, but even so. To him that is beautiful. He said I am what he needs. Angelic, a blazing conflagration in his heart. And none of my letters reached him. They were all sent back. So it is as if nothing has been said, even though my letters were written before I got to the love part of his. How can this be?  An ogre he is, always high on acid or pot. I have hardly talked to him. Before I left we stayed up until 0am, me, him and PROPNAME. Sitting on the grassy bank of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Being attacked by mosquitoes.  The sad thing is I know that in a week  I will dismiss  the situation, knowing his explosion of emotion must have been a result of drugs. But forgetting his poetic words, and how I may have brightened up his life. He wants to write movies together. That would be great if we could stay friends with the same old people always, me and PROPNAME and PROPNAME moving to LOCNAME after I gRADUATE, MAKING MOVIES. Yeah, like that would happen. And good old PROPNAME tagging alongside us, loving me. This morning the sun was low-- I am not used to mornings-- and it was cool. Perhaps I should start getting up earlier. The girl just sitting next to me was very flustered. I wish I could have helped but I didn't Have My if# with me. You know how in The Canterbury tales Chaucer capitalizes random Words just for the hell of it ?  Well that's how I type when I'm not thinking. I have a burn on my middle right finger and it hurts when I type. I talked to my brother and my ex-boyfriend on the phone Sunday night. I was good. I am so glad I talked to Woes. He wants us to say "I love you"  as friends when we talk. I couldn't get up the nerve this conversation but maybe next Tim I will. Its just so sappy and Embarrassing (note that capital E).  He is an awesome friend , though. It sucks so bad that he is a fundamentalist.  I had a dream last night about PROPNAME. The one that is soon to be gone to LOCNAME for a year. I think I'll write him letters. He called me the other day here at LOCNAME of all things. But I had to let him go bc PROPNAME was on the phone. Then I called back and he was gone, never to be heard from again. In my dr0eam we kissed. Like last summer and the summer before. In my dream he was in love with me all over again, in love with my smell. I was so happy and so was everyone else.  That sucks so bad that he's a devout Jew.    
__label__label1 today I called up some of my friends from LOCNAME (where I’m from) and we all went out to the drag. it was sooooo nice to be able to kill time, since it has been going by so slowly. I am so tired from walking all day. at least I found my exploring psychology book at bevos. I want to get fake nails put on tomorrow. my mom said that I could buy whatever I wanted, but I feel bad spending the money. oh well, at least I’m not doing anything illegal. I am so excited about rushing for that Christian sorority. I really want to make some lifelong friends here. not just some people who only care about themselves and what they're going to wear tomorrow. I wonder if it's true that a huge majority of psychology majors become shoe salesmen. great. I’m here getting homesick for nothing. I’m surprised that there are so many people talking outloud here at this computer lab. I thought I would be the loudest one here by simply opening my backpack. I wonder if it matters that I’m not using capital letters when I type. I’m sure it will be fine. I am so thirsty. since I've been here I have already finished off 00 bottles of water. at least it's helping to keep my skin clear (knock on wood). psychology is so interesting. I wonder what my stream of consciousness says about me. who knows, I’m probably sending off signals meaning that I’m going to be a psychotic weirdo when I get older. I like my necklace, but I feel like I am wearing a dog collar. it looks so tight on me; I have a huge neck to begin with. they say that the first sign of aging on a woman is when her neck wrinkles. well my neck has quite a few. I really like this computer. my keyboard is so annoying. this one has keys that write so smoothly. I hope I've been studying enough. I really need to get over the idea that college is extremely hard and requires absurd amounts of studying. I’m doing just fine!  I’m really surprised that I have so much to say. I thought I would be sitting here trying to impress whoever's going to read this by using really big words and coming up with impressive thoughts. I guess I was really wrong. I forgot my glasses in my dorm. I hope I’m not damaging my eyes by not wearing them. these girls sitting beside me are really getting loud. it's really getting annoying. all of a sudden they quieted down. I guess I’m sending off bad signals to them. I really feel like brushing my teeth. for some reason I've been brushing them an average of five times a day. it's probably some type of stress release or something. I wonder how my friend PROPNAME is doing back home. she just left to LOCNAME this morning. I wish I could have gone home with her but I really need to duke it out here. I can do it!!  what am I going to do tonight?  probably study or something. I hope my roommate decides to stay in our room for once. I guess I like my space though. my mind just went blank right now and I don’t have anything to say. I really admire the older people who come to college. I wish my mom would. she deserves it. I hope I am that devoted to my child. I don’t see how someone could give up so much for someone. I know I would do it for her, but just the fact that she has done so much for me already is amazing. I wonder if animals go to heaven when they die. I really think they do. it wouldn’t be fair to me if they didn’t. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing back home. I hope he is having a fun time. I’m so lucky to be here. I wish I could give back to someone else. maybe that volunteer organization will call me and ask if I want to help out. I definitely would jump at the chance. I need to go to the rec center and pick up an aerobics membership. I hope I’m not gaining weight here, but I guess I will find out when PROPNAME brings my scale back up with her. I better not be gaining weight, because I spent an enormous amount of money on a personal trainer. what a waste!  I hate it when people ask me what type of music I listen to. I really don’t know what to say because I don’t listen to very much music. I’m so glad I’m getting this assignment over with now so that I don’t have to rush to do it at the last minute. I need to go back to Mezes to sign up for some of those experiments. I hope there are some slots I can fill up. I’ll bet that so many people are going to end up writing a research paper just because they'll put of going to sign up for the experiments or because they don’t show up to participate. what a waste!  maybe I shouldn't talk, because I can just see that happening to me now. I wish I was good at math. that would be the ultimate!  I've been typing for twenty minutes now, so I think I’ll sign off. I’m surprisingly sleepy!  you all probably wont read this until a few months from now, but I just want to say thanks for such a wonderfully convenient assignment :) I hope I’m not too weird :)))) 
__label__label1 This computer lab is scary. I think that at any moment I will mess everything up. This is so weird, writing homework out on a Saturday night. What else can I say? I'm seriously scared that college is not going to turn out how I want it to. Oh well. I'm so tired. There are two girls next to me that are talking just way to loud and it is hard to concentrate on typing. I wish that they would be quiet. Oh Well! Anyway, I really can't think of anything else to type. Man, I wish those girls would talk a little bit more quietly, it is starting to get on my nerves. Some people can be seriously rude. Last night I met the most interesting people. I went to a party at my sister's house and it was okay. At the end of the party there were these guys that live next door to her that got into a fight and called the police on each other. When they got there, the police asked us if we knew anything about a gun. I really don't know what went down with those guys and I really don't care. Those girls are really loud and they are majorly getting on my nerves. Now two other girls on the other side of me are talking really loud about some guy they e-mailed an embarrassing message to. I don't understand why people talk so loud do they think that everyone else cares what they are talking about? I am really getting pissed now!!!! Why are these people talking so loud in the computer lab?  I'm getting cold. I wish that the people next to me would shut up. Yeah they did now for a few seconds I can concentrate. I have to clean my dorm room tomorrow. So much fun!!!! I'm thinking about joining a Christian sorority. Hopefully it will be lots of fun. I'm supposed to go to a meeting about it with my friend PROPNAME. Man, I have to remember to find an article for my E000 class for my first writing assignment. I have no idea what I am going to write about. Maybe tomorrow I will find an interesting article in the newspaper. Just five more minutes to go. There they go again, talking so loud, it is seriously distracting and annoying. Don't those girls know that you're supposed to be quiet in the library. I wonder what I'm going to do later on tonight? I think I'm going to watch a movie or talk to my parents on the phone. College is so scary. I'm homesick a lot, but I've been getting better each day that I've been here. I really love LOCNAME but I'm just ready to go home also. I miss my friends PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I need to remember to go get my film developed so I can see them. I had so much fun the night before I left to go to college. I'm really looking forward to Monday since there won't be any classes. Well, I think I'm ready to go to sleep. I need to remember to call my mom and ask her to send me some stamps. This is getting boring. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME are doing tonight. I wonder if they're kicking back without me in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss my best friend PROPNAME, because we always could talk about things without saying much of anything. Well, I'm tired of typing and it has been 00 minutes so I'm going to stop. 
__label__label0 The problem I have with this writing assignment is that there is so much going on in my life right now that all of these different worries and concerns keep popping into my head. The one thing that I am looking forward to is that today I am meeting my parents in LOCNAME LOCNAME for dinner. They are giving me my fraternity dues in the form of a check and my answering machine . My pledge brother PROPNAME is listening to ORGNAME right now so it is very hard to concentrate and rigit is pissing me off. My humanities course is causing me a lot of stress because the teacher did not pass out any kind of syllabus so I have no idea how I will be graded. It just occurred to me that this essay is sounding more like the second writing assignment than the first, but I guess it doesn't really matter if school is what's on my mind. The girl next door has been on my mind a lot. Lately I find myself wondering what she is doing even though we agreed to be just friends because she lives next door. And now that I think about it another girl is always on my mind too. However she lives upstairs and I'm pretty sure I could hook up with her if I wanted. I am very excited about my fraternity. I am looking forward to our bar tap on Friday and I have promised myself I wouldn't drink until then. I really need to establish a routine, because I think once I do that I will be a lot less stressed. I need to start working out again to so that I won't feel like a complete piece of crap for partying too much. Last night I went to PROPNAME PROPNAME to see the girl I am kind of dating but actually I don't feel any kind of affection for her. Which is something I should tell her because she apparently likes me alot. I think I am starting to get kind of sick . Probably has something to do with the fact I go to bed between 0 and 0 every night, but at least I scheduled afternoon classes. 
__label__label0 Philosophy. can one truly think that one knows nothing?  If one truly thinks that one knows nothing, doesn't that mean that he in fact truly knows something. that he knows nothing. If God is omnipotent can he make a rock so heavy he can't carry it?  God. If he were the perfect God why hasn't he made himself present to the entire world?  How can this world think so highly ORGNAME itself that it thinks it has found the right religion already. Maybe the true God has never been seen, has never been thought, has never been written down before. There always exists the possibility that perhaps the world came about in a way no one has every thought of before. It's possible and very probable. Can one truly put all his faith in God. If God is an almighty, omnipotent being, can one put his entire life into God's hands?  But then God says not to be foolish. Is it foolish to want an explanation. Maybe the confusion is meant for a reason. Have to get an application to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. To be a genius wouldn't be so bad. It wouldn't be that great either. Everything has its ups and downs, black, white, heaven, hell, etc. Perhaps the goal is to reach a true balance. Maybe then we'll be content. Then again to be content and balanced you would have to have some discontent. Fashion is definitely too emphasized in this world. When will comfort be in?  It will probably take off like a forest fire. People will realize there are plenty of more important things than clothes and appearance. Of course that doesn't mean stop bathing and wearing dirty clothes. People need to get priorities straight. Why waste your time taking a speeding ticket to court. Time is money. Time is more valuable than money. Without time we are nothing. Without money, we are without money. Time will never wait nor come back. Smurfs. I remember Smurfs. Back in the childhood days when things weren't so complicated. A tiny blue creature was simply a tiny blue creature. Not a tiny conniving blue wench searching for self promotion or upholding a social image or making the extra buck. It was a time of snowmen and berry fights and rope swinging and rock climbing and tadpole watching. Nothing more, nothing less but perhaps invaluable. 
__label__label1 When I first decided to go back to school I knew from my current job at ORGNAME ORGNAME for the Blind that I wanted to enrich my knowledge in the fields  of the social and psychological sciences. I soon realized that most of the more detailed social science classes required PSY 000. This brings us to the present. I have always had a strong interest in the ways and whys of peoples reactions to life. Since I was a young girl people have come to me for answers to questions on their lives or advice of different content. Supplying folks with this help has never over taxed my own brain and I have even found it to be very rewarding. I always chalked my natural abilities up to my own experiences as a child. I was ordered by law to see a psychologist because of the fighting of my parents over my sister and myself. I did the Rohrshac(inkblot test) , the what do you see in the clouds thing and many other "buzz" tests of the day (circa mid 0000's). Anyway, these test never showed my little 0,0,0, and 0 year old psyche to be under too much mental duress and I was an above average student at school. I even skipped lessons in 0st grade and was moved to 0nd because I knew how to read. However, since the death of my father last year and the pre-grieving of watching someone be taken by AIDS, my need to make heads or tails out of some of the reasons and whys my own life has unfolded as it has , has become an intensified desire I must look further into. 
__label__label0 I'm thinking ORGNAME being tired. It's been a long weekend, Mama was a great lady. I loved PROPNAME and ORGNAME. Too bad I didn't attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I could be there now. I love snow. My 0st snowman on the top of Pap's truck. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are on their walk. The dog was asleep the whole trip home because of, Labor day weekend, LOCNAME was almost empty, I don't know my way around LOCNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I'm so glad that my phone line is working now. 0-0 service days. I can't understand you lady. It's been 0 minutes. My hand is beginning to hurt.

The Ranch - I haven't been there in a while. I still need some books. AHHHHHH. I need a job because I'm about to run out of money. It's been ten whole minutes. I'm 0/0 done. PROPNAME, "I love you!"  come home in Sept. My b-bay. Friday the 00th next year. I hate horror movies, PROPNAME PROPNAME under the blanket, PROPNAME is a *****. My mouse pad is ugly. teddy bear computer as a graduation present. WHATEVER - I need a CD rack PMS curtain san finally be finished. GOD. green light is on the computer, annoying. I wonder what everyone else thinks about when they write this. paper 0st is definitely better KEYS. Ohh-la-la, Sexy!!  Why is there a screwdriver on my desk? I don't even own Only 0 minutes!

__label__label1 I am sitting here at ORGNAME ORGNAME, boy I am so stressed out. I have these  two writing assignments for psychology a whole bunch of pre-cal homework  and tons of reading to do for Biology and Sociology. this sorority stuff  is starting to take up way to much time. I really don't like the feeling I  am getting when I am set up with a date because it makes me feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't feel bad since I am just being friends with them and nothing more it just really bothers me sometimes. I really don't feel like going out tonight because I still  think I am sick from yesterday. I need to go and call my mom and dad  since I haven't talked to them in about five days I am just way to busy. I think I really need to work on some major time management skills because I  am worried about getting behind and I want to get 0 As and 0 Bs so I can  start off good before my classes get too hard. I am really excited about  UT vs. OU weekend I hope that PROPNAME can go so that I don't have to go with some random guy. I wish it wasn't the same weekend as my schools homecoming so that I could go home oh well. I need to take a shower and get ready  for the KA mixer and try to read and definitely watch 00000. That was 00 Minutes. THANK YOU!  HAVE A NICE DAY! 
__label__label0 Ok I've put this off long enough and you say that 00% of the class has already completed this assignment so I think its time for me to too. 00 minutes. jeez that seems like a really long time now that I’m sitting here and just RAMBLING on and on and on and on. . this is all typing on one line. do I have to hit return to send it to the next line??

It always seem like I misspell no one. because that would be pronounced NOON would it not?? if I said NO  space ONE. then that would sound ok but it looks SOO weird!!! AHHHH!!!  I am  slowly going crazy 0 0 0 0 0 0 switch. slowly am I going crazy. 0 0 0 0 0 0 switch. you know what?? this is a really really cool assignment!! I think it'd be cool if I could jut talk to someone like this totally going off on tangents whenever I want to. speaking of tangents. i hate precalculus!!!  I don’t think I should take calculus in college cause my roommate( who I will get to later) says its really  hard and he's quite the WIZ at math. I’ll take it at community college maybe,. yeah yeah yeah. ogh my roommate kareem. he’s a friend of mine from LOCNAME. its like we've been together 00-0 since we moved in together and its really kinda annoying. i feel bad cause he was like one of my best friends and now its like I don’t wanna be around him anymore!!. so I’ll tell you what I want what I really really want. if you want my future forget my past. if you wanna get with me. better make it fast. SPICE girls SUCK!!! I’m listening to a new CD right now that I got at the radio station at LOCNAME---00. 0 ORGNAME. I'm applying for a position there as a DJ or something. that should be thrilling. I just wanna be heard GUYS!!!  if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends. if the song was called gotta get it would be COOLER!!!  this is  gonna be like so long!!! I still have 00 minutes!! what am I gonna do!!!  there was this girl in front of us in PSYCH. today who my friend says is really stuck up and superficial so I kept whispering "superficial" to see if she'd turn around. she never did. so does this mean she's NOT superficial  or she IS. she just doesn’t know it. as often is the case. I think this paper rocks man!!

I have a lot of gay friends case I worked t the gap this summer~~~that was actually like the coolest job I've had THUS far in my illustrious career in the working world. 0 minutes to GO!!! yay!!! HOW in the hell are  y’all gonna read all this!!!!  my roommate just came home. what a DORK. he’s in the bathroom rite now. I told him he cant be in here cause he’s interrupting me but it's really cause I don’t want him to see what I wrote!!!  uh OH . phone call.

I LOVE YOU!!! whoever reads this!!!  knowledge is power. and teachers go around giving it away for free~~how sweet!!! well actually I believe there were some fees included in this class. and its not like the teachers aren’t compensated in some sort so Somebody’s paying for them to  give away the knowledge. SO anyway. its been real. I'm actually sad to go. I've become so attached. talk to you later!!! love y a more!!! ~~~~~~PROPNAME 
__label__label1 I'm so glad PROPNAME, my roommate, just left to see PROPNAME, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. I think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. I remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. I don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when I’m not using it. Someone is very loud in the hall. They sound like they are having fun. wish I could join them. Is PROPNAME thinking about me right now?  I wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. I wish I was a better typist. There is so much chemistry I need to be doing. Is there a party in the next room?  PROPNAME just walked in. is he up to something?  This room is kind of hot and I could really drink something cold right now. I just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language I don't know. French wouldn't be bad to learn, though. Wish I was at LOCNAME LOCNAME right now. I just saw PROPNAME and PROPNAME on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. Well mom and dad were fun, but PROPNAME was a royal pain in the butt. I even have Chip and PROPNAME wallpaper on my PC. gosh, am I a fanatic or what. I think I just know a good thing when I see one. Speaking of good things, I wish I was good at chemistry so I wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. I don't think I'm doing this assignment right because I'm now to the point where I'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. My hair is in my face and I wish it was alot longer than it is so I could pull it back. Jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. This comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and I always hit it when typing. Who keeps slamming those doors. Doesn't anyone have homework besides me. I put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. This coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, PROPNAME is so cute nose itches. it always does. Does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. If it's true I hope it's PROPNAME. I wonder where he is now. Is he going to call me soon. When I get through with this I need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. I miss PROPNAME. She's the only friend I can really tell things to. If she came up to UT I would never get any of my homework done. But then again she would spend alot of time with my brother. He treats her so bad. I don't know why she puts up with it. I always wondered why people couldn't answer when I asked them what they were thinking. This assignment proves there is always something on your mind. I just hit the home key and it took me to the beginning of this writing and I wasn't smart enough to figure out to hit the end key until I scrolled all the way through what I just wrote. If I could type faster this assignment would flow a lot more smoothly and I wouldn't lose any of my thoughts while typing previous ones. I wonder how long it's been. The way I'm sitting here is hurting my back. I can't believe I wrecked my car and got whiplash. It's been two months and I'm still doped up. I can't even carry a bookbag without it hurting. It sounds like there is a guy talking outside my window but that is not possible because I'm on the tenth floor. It's been almost twenty minutes but this is kind of fun. I should do this more often. It got my mind off of chem for a while and relieved some of my stress. I'm such a basket case anyway, I worry way too much about stuff that I end up doing just fine on. The phone is ringing in the other room. I wonder when PROPNAME is going to call me. If I didn't worry about him so much and worried about chem a little more I probably wouldn't hate it so much. I can't wait to go to the frat party this weekend. There are so many guys there that want to go out with me. I wonder if that's true or if PROPNAME just said that to flatter me or to make himself believe that he has a beautiful girlfriend. Oh I'm so bad, I've only known him for a little while and I'm already second guessing him. He is actually the best guy I've had in a while. He is so smart. how sexy. That guy is still talking outside of my window. I guess I shouldn't be correcting my mistakes when typing but even my friends say I'm a bit of a perfectionist. 
__label__label1 Well, here I go with the good old stream of consciousness assignment again. I feel like I'm back in freshman HS English class again. Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, but my English teacher freshman year made us do these assignments constantly, and mine were always completely ridiculous, like, "wow, I'm really hungry. I wish I could go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. "  They really had no point, except as busy work. In a psychology class, though, I can see the reasoning behind an assignment like this. Just letting my mind go free, and putting my random thoughts down in writing could be a big help in figuring out why I'm such a psychological screw-up. Well, that's not true. I don't want y'all getting the wrong idea about me, being that today was the first day of class and all. I'm really not a nut case. People may think I am, but really, I'm a normal kind of gal. Actually, down here in LOCNAME, I guess I'm not normal. I don't like to eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and country fried steak with fried okra for dinner. I'm from LOCNAME, and we don't even HAVE okra, much less worship it like it's some kind of vegetable goddess. My mind is starting to go blank--performance pressure I guess. I'm on the spot here--I don't want you all to be bored while you're reading this, if you ever do get around to reading this, that is. Well, I'm not going to stress just yet, so you're probably going to have to listen to some of my random, incoherent babbling for a few paragraphs. These computers are a big old pain in the ass. Here in the ORGNAME, sure, they've got a bajillion computers, but unfortunately, we've got 00 bajillion students trying to use them, all at the same time. I think I'll be spending quite a few late, late nights in the computer center, just to get my stuff done. Yippee. That's what college is all about--late nights in the libraries. Yeah. Right. At this point, I don't even know what college is all about. I probably shouldn't say anything though, seeing as how I'm going to have to write another one of these thingys in a few days, where the topic is "college"  Blah, blah, blah. I can't believe I'm actually doing this assignment on the same day that is was assigned!  Go me!  Talk about dedication. I really can't believe this. In high school, procrastination was my middle name. No, it was my first name. By second semester, I have more free periods in a day than actual classes, so I didn't have to do a damn thing. It was great!  Unfortunately, because of that, I'm going to have to work that much harder here at LOCNAME, to get those studying skills back up to par. High School. Now that was a trip. When I was there, I couldn't wait to get out of there. I hated that school, that town, everything except my friends, of course. Then, my family moved, right after graduation, and I learned real quick that there were worse places to be than in my old town. At least back home I have my friends and my boyfriend and my piece of crap car, and I knew what there was to do. After I moved, I had no friends, no life, no car, no nothing. I worked all day. That's it. now, though, I'm ready for this whole college thing. Austin seems like a fun city, where I might actually enjoy spending the next four years. Oh yeah. While we're on the subject of "four years,"  why is it that all the professors & administrators that give speeches and stuff always make it sound like we'll be in college for like, 0 or 0 years?  I'm sorry, but I plan on graduating in 0 years. What's the problem here?  What are people doing, that they can't graduate in 0 years?  I just don't get it. no offense if any of y'all reading this took like 0 years to do your undergrad work. I'm not trying to knock you, just trying to figure this out. Well, it's 0:00, exactly 00 minutes after I started this nifty little piece of writing that makes no sense and has no point. I'm not really sure if I have fulfilled this assignment, like if I was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness, where it took me, and what that means regarding my own personality. I guess if I had to, I could say that my mind works in mysterious ways, and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected, to me, I can see the patterns. Yeah. I just went back & tried to read this over again, and I've got to give a suggestion. For these assignments, make the box we're writing in a box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time, without have to scroll across , because it's a real big pain for me, and I'm sure it's just as big a pain for you when you're trying to read it. Unless, of course, when you read it, you can see the whole line at once. I don't know, just a suggestion!  Thanks for taking the time to give us all the opportunity to get an easy 00 % of out final grade through these writing assignments! 
__label__label0 Whenever I do assignments like these, I usually seem to write over the required time. I've always been more of a thinker than a talker. I seem to possess the strange habit of going into such deep thought that I am completely oblivious to my surroundings, something that really annoys both my sister and boyfriend. I guess I don't really feel the need to always take part in hincty conversation taking place around me. At the moment I'm wondering if I'm supposed to go to the next line while writing or if I'm supposed to keep writing in one straight line like this. The screen seems to just be going to the right when I type instead of ending and going to the next line. Right now I am listening to PROPNAME. I can hear it from the bedroom- I'm sitting in the living room which attaches to the kitchen. When I walked into this apartment for the first time ever, it had a much different feel to it than it does now. This is PROPNAME's apartment, my boyfriend, and it feels bigger than when I saw it for the first time. I'm typing on his computer-wow, I finally went to the next line-because my laptop has seen nothing but endless problems from when I first got it. My fingers are feeling numb while typing- he keeps it so cold in here. He's gone to run errands for a couple of hours so this felt like the perfect time to work on this assignment. Psychology has always interested me. I went to visit ORGNAME and sat in on a psychology class and never before had a class interested me as much as this one did. Actually, I think it was at PROPNAME. I couldn't stop talking to my mom about it. But that's not really the field I want to go into. I really want to go into early-childhood education. While in that class, the professor showed a film of schizophrenia where one example was a woman who, in one stage of her mind, became an infant and when she cried, the whole class was shocked by how much she actually sounded like a baby. I have no regret that I choose UT. I love PROPNAME and I'm not the kind of person to let 000-people classes  bother me. I can't  help but feel like while writing this I should focus more on my emotions or something- glancing back over this I realize how boring this is and I apologize to the reader. It doesn't seem to me that my thoughts are usually this shallow and simple but then again, when I'm thinking to myself, my thoughts are not usually this clear-cut. They're usually one huge mass of ideas and vibes I receive from my surroundings. Well, once again I think I've gone a bit over my time limit so I'll stop now. I'm glad this is graded on completion and not depth. 
__label__label1 Today was a tough day for me. I can't believed I failed to talk to  PROPNAME. No girl has ever had that much power on me. Its probably the sun kicking in. I can't wait to go to the football game on Saturday. LOCNAME  is definitely going to beat ORGNAME b/c ORGNAME lost last week to a weak team by more than 00 points. Calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. I hope we get no homework or else I will be very busy Wed. night. That phone next door is driving me crazy! Why does PROPNAME have the ringer on so high? I need to buy the PROPNAME CD soon. The songs on that CD will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to PROPNAME. I hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that I am not some weird freak. PROPNAME seems to enjoy studying Chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. I guess he feels insecure about his ability in Chemistry. I hope the ORGNAME win next week at LOCNAME. It should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. Who cares about the ORGNAME?  Tonight I want to email Steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. Maybe things will clear up the next few days and I will finally have the courage to do what I am so good at: socializing. I have never froze up like this in a long time. Maybe I am thinking too much about screwing up. I know I am better than that. Baseball season is almost near the homestretch. I hope the ORGNAME can catch up to the ORGNAME and go back to the World Series. My parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. I wondering how PROPNAME is adjusting at Rice?  I hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing PROPNAME because I am not there to help her get through this hard time. I am glad I was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. I really miss her a lot but at the same time I know she will be fine. I sound like her parents. I wonder how PROPNAME's drive to LOCNAME is?  His dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. This room needs more AC. AC. The idiot next door is blaring his music. Spice girls suck!  If he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. I think I am starting to feel the effects of the LOCNAME chicken. That stuffed dog looks like Snoopy. PROPNAME must be attached to this toy. 
__label__label1 Today. Had to turn the music down. Today I went to the KVRX meeting. I  will hopefully have my own radio show. I don’t know what I will talk about. I have considered in great depth and. Jeez this songs starts off quietly. cool beginning. should start louder. oh well can't all be perfect. My roommate is playing the same game . he plays that game too much and spends too much time with it. does he get homework?  I just don't know. This song is rather erotic. in a very deep and disturbing way. I can't decide whether I actually want to study medical technology or not. I love many things form chemistry to mycology to religious studies/. speaking  of which I had a very good time at my PSA meeting. PROPNAME student alliance. ahh. gotta love that screech the chairs let when you push them back. ahhhhh. well. oh yeah at the meeting I met several people. PROPNAME seems rather worried about one of the women. though he is bound and like wise I am unable  to speak ill of her. Well I am in charge of running our booth Monday. or is it Tuesday. That song is one again. his team (my roommate) I s winning. YEESH. Well I guess if he enjoys it. my typing is rather poor and this assignment is taking a long time. 00 minutes. been 0. . lalalalalalalal. Yes the meeting. I talked about shamanism. which apparently comes from a Siberian word. being that there are several hundred different shamanic following in this world. due to the vast number of tribes that speckle our world. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a very sexy voice. I would love to make love to this song,. Well. too much. info. /. Dtos are fun ellipses. that word too is fun. I think that perhaps I am slowly running out of things to say. . That song reminds me of my young age. riding in the car and talking to my  family. the streetlights were bright back then and things were happy. or where they. perhaps not,, I don't remember that well. My car was full of all of us and the  dog wasn't around. She isn't anymore either. epilepsy has taken her from this incarnation. I wonder what she is  doing now. Does she know that I miss her???? I  wish I could find out. Possibly clairvoyance. That is of course under the assumption that spirits are all equal. they are. I know. For I am. Yes I was and shall be. ever. My childhood bears a interesting mark of past fuzziness. I can't seem to recollect exact details like others. very brown. ,. fuzzy is the best word. The 00's really did suck. I wonder why that CD is still lying there on the answering machine. I love bright circling colors. they interest me. not in a psychotic manner but in a very hypnotic manner. they calm. I like to be calm and sedate/. Though activity on occasion is good. . . . PROPNAME is not a good color. neutral  yes but very passive. though passive is good. LOCNAME. there's a philosophy. They believe that by doing nothing they do everything. interesting. I am currently reading PROPNAME PROPNAME His hermetic order seems rather interesting though a bit on the abnormal and almost eccentric side. I remember reading stories about spiders. And milkmen in fields with roses. no daisies. yeah daisies. Looking down upon the daisies as they look up to me. I want to do a past life regression and find out who I was. I wonder if I have been anyone famous or popular. Wow I am saying some rather strange things. interesting. I didn't. . My head hurts. and my room is hot. I would like to stop this. I have 0 minutes left and nothing to say except for watching my fingers press the buttons is a rather enjoyable activity. they press slowly and heavy. sometimes fast and lithe. I mean light. yeah light. so I hope I am doing this right. I am putting my consciousness on record for others to read. I guess that's cool. It should be interesting though I have said very little. I wonder what other are saying. ahh the three minutes have passed and my typing ill now slow to a halt. 
__label__label1 Today has been an interesting day. I woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt I was in a bad mood. Then I went into ORGNAME kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and I thought I would read the morning paper the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME to keep up the what is going on in the death of PROPNAME, ORGNAME of Whales. Since I am starting out in my major right now, which is Journalism, I find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the ORGNAMEefront of all media coverage in every medium. It seems strange that I am 00 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. It is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. I am actually studying ORGNAME Relations, but I have to study Journalism as the foundation for my study. I guess I chose PR because my dad is the Public ORGNAME ORGNAME for the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. He has worked there for over 00 years and I used to accompany him to work on some occasions when I was a kid. I think I liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. Also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. I liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. Also, I loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer.  Oops!!  I just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. It was my husbandORGNAME Professor that is the chair on his dissertation. Her name is PROPNAME and I always joke with PROPNAME that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. I don't really believe it, but I like to tease him. I know PROPNAME will be very faithful to me. That is one of the things I love most about him. Anyway. Getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that I read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of PROPNAME, Princess of Whales. I think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that I didn't even know about before. I don't worship Princess Di, but I feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. The articles revealed how much she is the ORGNAME's Princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. I think to myself, wow!  What kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. She did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and AIDS victims. She was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. In some ways, I see her doing a Christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. I believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and/or fame which demands mass attention and respect. I love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. I am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. I am feeling very sad once again. Why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. I wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. Why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. I believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. I am thankful for people such as Princess PROPNAME and for the example she has been to so many. That brings me to another reoccurring thought. Is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. I believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. God wants us to recognize that He is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to Him for guidance and help in this life. So getting back to my earlier point, taking Princess PROPNAME as an example. Some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of Princess PROPNAME this whole week in the media. Well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. Isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. Yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't DO anything like make new laws or something important like that. My goodness!!!  That just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. That is unfair. I think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. Every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. Why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. I know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. Why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so ME-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. Why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. Haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. My wish is that people will carry on Princess Di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. We could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another.  Well, this has definitely succeeded the 00 minute allotment. I thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. It has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. We need more heroes like PROPNAME. She is an example to us all. It is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. I pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death. 
__label__label0 At the moment I’m sitting in my room enjoying a 00 oz. slurpee. A cherry and coke mix, which is my favorite. I have been relaxing after another crummy cafeteria meal thinking about the days occurrences. Tuesdays and Thursdays are rough because I have to go to class all day. Classes aren't really that bad but they seem to put a large strain on  the mind making a body feel worn out. The course load for me this year is tuff and it seems that I have little free time left. This is a very strange assignment in my mind. I can't see what y’all can get from hearing me ramble on about nothing, but if it helps then I guess its worth it. Chapter two in the Psy. book is very interesting in fact I have found the  course to be interesting. To bad it comes after an hour and a half of chemistry and the most boring class I have ever been in. The selection of girls in the class isn't bad either. So an interesting class combined with good looking scenery is a big plus in my book. Whoa brain freeze. damn I hate those. Well after this I have to start on my M 000D homework. Now that is one hard class. That one and Chem 000 are going to be the death of me this semester. It seems like a 00 minute free flow writing assignment seems like it  would be hard, but once you start it just seems to flow, kind of like a good rap song. I really like rap the combination of a good beat and  a master on the microphone to me is really fine music. However, I love oldies too The Beatles, Mommas & the Pappas, The Monkeys, and so on  are really good listening music. Kind of like returning to my roots I guess. Well that was twenty minutes so I’ll shut up now hope this was enough to fulfill your requests.  
__label__label1 My love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as I sit here and write this assignment. I don't understand any sLOCNAMEtware but everything for ORGNAME, and the Macintosh is completely foreign to me. I must have already asked at least 00 questions regarding the system, but hey I am new to this whole ORGNAME thing. Apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to ORGNAME and the computer world will be a lot happier. Every time I type the word a lot, I am reminded of my English teacher in 00th grade, or maybe it was 0th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. I'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that I should have written it as two. I think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. I see a lot of people around campus just like that although I remember their faces and words, for the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, Azi, do you remember me?? More than likely I would not, or I would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. I do that a lot. People will have said that they may have called my name 0 or 0 times before I responded by just looking up. My thoughts consume me sometimes. I have a problem with daydreaming. I know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. It is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. I was talking about my thoughts, and how I daydream. Well, lately all I can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man I am to marry. It seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a Freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. I have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. I went to a summer church retreat, and I think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because I met guys for the first time that I could honestly see myself marrying. This has never happened before, and as I glance around the campus, I just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and I am here longing for there company. It is not like I need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. I miss them a whole lot because I have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that I met at this church retreat in LOCNAME. I think I forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout LOCNAME, and I have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless I actively seek a job to where I can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful LOCNAME LOCNAME of LOCNAME. All of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and I miss them terribly. I have to go back some day, I haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as I had in LOCNAME. I know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little  bit of why I would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason I would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a Baptist church, or a Jewish synagogue embodies. That spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. It would be ideal if I could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. Get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and I stress this because that is a big part of my life, but I am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. It's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, I am not asking for the PROPNAME and ORGNAME playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, I just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. I just don't think that I can have that right now, and that is why I spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. The challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. And if I may I would like to end with a statement that PROPNAME PROPNAME made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes. 
__label__label0 I have never used PROPNAME's computer before. It's kind of weird. I don't  like the font being used on this computer. I wish there was a way I could  change it. I am also very irritated that I am still on the same line that  I started on. Maybe if I press enter it will start a new line. There you go. Much better. I am kind of tempted to use this fan connected  on the  desk here, even though I am not hot. I just feel like using it. PROPNAME is funny. We keep writing each other email even though we could be sitting right next to each other. PROPNAME is coming to visit tomorrow. I am so excited. PROPNAME said that he might come the next weekend. I am in love with PROPNAME. He has no idea though. I wish I could tell him, but I know that he does not feel  the same way. He is always talking about how picky he is. I am certainly  not his type. God I wish I was. I told him that one day I would be perfect for him. Sigh. I can't wait to see him. I keep thinking of my exboyfriend. He has to be the biggest jerk known to man. The problem is that I don't think of the bad stuff, only the good. Ok, this is driving me crazy. I don't know how this page has been arranged, but I don't like it . ARGH!  Someone just  died in Carries dorm last night. It sounds horrible. I would be so scared if someone down the hall from me was killed. I've got ten minutes to go. I  can dig it. I don't really like Amber. She gross. Smokes too much. I don't smoke that often. PROPNAME just found one of PROPNAME's hidden cigs. It was funny. He was all saying, I've never seen that before. He's cute. Today's his  birthday. I haven't gotten him a present yet, although I know what I'm gonna get  him. I'm sleepy. I almost feel asleep in biology. Someone did PROPNAME PROPNAME put the spotlight on them. I wonder what someone reading this would be thinking right now. Who the hell is PROPNAME probably. That would be an interesting  job. Reading all the submissions. People's minds are fascinating. I wish I c could read people's minds. Thoughts are cool. You know most of the time  people are really thinking about sex or something else taboo. Actually, I don’t really know if that's true, but I've read statistics. I don't think  about sex all the time, but I do often remember kisses, or picture myself  kissing someone. I hope that's normal. Kissing is so romantic. It can  mean so much. How depressing it is to not have someone to kiss. I often  feel sorry for myself. I don't think that's wrong. My sister just walked in. I was kind of worried that she would see what I was writing. Is that wrong, to be writing about kissing. It is kind of personal. I'm thinking about  dogs now. They are so cute. I really love baby animals. I can't wait to  live in an apartment or house where I can own a mutt. I'd like to own a dog with PROPNAME someday. I think it would scare him if he knew how much I thought  about him. I don't know if I really am in love with him, but I often think I  am. If only I could be forty pounds lighter. I had planned on losing five pounds a month. I haven't checked since moving to LOCNAME. I don't think I’ve lost any weight though. I tend to eat a lot of cafeteria food. We are  going out to dinner to night. I need to ask PROPNAMEulie if she has a scale so that  I can weigh myself. I wasn't to sure I wanted to go. It's with PROPNAME and J and  friends I don't know. I hope I get along well with everyone. I wonder if my train of thought that I'm typing is a good representation of how I really think. Wow, I've written for 00 minutes now. Those last ten minutes flew by. My hand hurts now so I guess I'll stop. I feel as though I should thank you  for listening. Thanks         
__label__label0 Right now I am in my friend's Jester dorm to do my writing 0 with her computer. I will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the LOCNAME LOCNAME campus are always full. It is really annoying when I have to wait to use a computer. I just don't have time to wait, since I have so much homework to do. I feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. People told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. I am still not use to living in the dorm. It is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. I miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. I am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. My leg and arm muscles are aching, since I played basketball and worked out at the Rec Center yesterday. I like the facility there. There is a good variety of things to do. I plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. The Boyz II Men new song called "The Four Seasons" is in my head right now. I enjoy listening to the song. It sounds very sweet and peaceful. The song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at U. T. I am now listening to the movie called "Space Jam. " My sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. I saw the movie about half a year ago. I thought it was a very cute movie. It is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. My favorite basketball player, PROPNAME PROPNAME, is one of the main characters in the movie. I like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. It is so cool when PROPNAME makes a slam dunk. He really does fly a little. I hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. I hope I won't be very nervous when I go into my classes. I have four classes to go to tomorrow! I am really excited about seeing my senior U. T. cousin tomorrow!  
__label__label0 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am thrilled!!! to be here at LOCNAME. I've always loved PROPNAME ever since I visited here when I was younger speaking of which I have been feeling like I was a little kid lately because I am in a new place with new people everything is new. Sometimes new is fun like in relationships. new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another. Like my roommate and I are VERY  tired of each other right now. Every little thing she does annoys me and I am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits. I have several annoying ones. My boyfriend says he has not found any, but that leads back to the whole newness thing. He doesn't quite know me. and I'm not quite sure I want him to . I want some ORGNAME's right now because I am starving I haven't eaten since this morning because I have been running all over campus getting things done. I went to a meeting for the Pom squad tryouts and I had a memory rush from high school The chick who is the director is one of my old drill team director's friends and lets just say I don't like to think of drill team much. Although it seems to be on my mind alot lately because I have been questioning weather or not I should be in LOCNAME or not. I am really truly happy for PROPNAME and brooke and PROPNAME, but I can't help but be envious. I know PROPNAME is loving shoving this in my face but I wish she wouldn't Why can't we just be friends again like we were last year all of this other crap had to start and now its finished kind of. I guess not totally finished because I am still stringing Earl along. I don’t  mean to be so selfish but I like having someone there for security. I have always been given security from my parents and I am used to that feeling I miss my parents they do so much for me like my mom getting this new job one that I don't even know if she likes just to make more money so I can go to UT. My sister loves to spend my parents money and I am finding out how easy it is when you're far from home and you don't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us. I can not even fathom what having a child must be like sometimes I want to have children and get married and settle down and other times I don't want any of that mushy stuff. That is kind of what Earl is there for. Incase I decide to pursue the romantic side in me which I seriously doubt so I should just let him go and I am really bad at typing I used to be better but I guess I am a little out of practice I tool 0 typing classes in high school which I had a nice time in we have such an awesome senior class. I was so proud but now everybody is gone off to do their own thing I can't spell either I have always had that problem ever since I was little my whole family makes fun of me for it especially my sister. I wonder how long I have been typing I haven't typed like this since staying up all night writing and typing my senior research paper on PROPNAME. I love Ms. PROPNAME she was a great teacher I wonder how heather is doing in LOCNAME I should call her tonight and see if she likes her class. It would be awesome to live in LOCNAME the Indigo girls are from LOCNAME LOCNAME and I have always wanted to go there and see their home town I think where people are from say alot about them. like my cousin is from LOCNAME and she a real heavy accent her whole family does I hope she is ok. She went a little crazy after her father died, but who wouldn't my mother is crazy. poor woman is going through so much right now and PROPNAME has to be feeling the same way with both of her daughters moving out at the same time. 
__label__label0 My thoughts, sensations, and emotions are always changing with each new experience, idea, and whatever happens throughout my life. They are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently. Right now I feel like I am in control of myself because I am doing well in school academically, socially, and mentally. School work is very important to me and I make sure that I do well. I don't go overboard like a lot of my friends who study hours every day. Socially, I have adapted very well in meeting new friends. Mentally, I am in control and focused on what is going on in my life. There were some problems that have caused some stress in my life since college started. First, me and my roommate got in some petty arguments, but now we are getting along just fine. Also, I had some guy problems. I regretted doing some things I knew I shouldn't have done, but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before. I know that I haven't been eating right and sleeping enough, which is causing some changes in my body that cause me to be more tired and weak. I always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for my classes. Last night a friend called at two in the morning and I talked to him for hours even though I should have y eight-o-clock class. I am in a very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me. I'm usually a nice pleasant person until I am faced with a lot of stress or go through PMS. Then I get in a really bad mood. My friends know when to stay away from me. The only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. the assignments they give us are no problem, but the reading is crazy. They bombard us with reading assignments that  really aren't necessary. My art class, for instance, requires for the present moment for me to read from pages 00 to 000-something. I really don't want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras. Anyway, I miss my family, but I'm not homesick at all. How can I be when my parents call ALL the time?  I know they care for me, but it's really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend, which I won't allow them to do. That sounds mean, but they're going to have to get used to it. I do miss the free laundry and the home-cooked meals and my own room and my nice bathroom, but oh well.                     
__label__label0 well I am just sitting here thinking about how I cannot wait to get home and go to sleep now I am thinking about my girlfriend and how much I really care for her I don't know, now notre dame football just popped into my head and I decided to slow down my typing because I am typing faster than I can think. I just thought about why we cannot stop and think about this project then I asked a question to myself about my ring, and why it is so dirty. well you see I am this huge notre dame fan and would give anything to go there but I didn't get in d so I am going to have to wait another year of so. I feel bad for not correcting these words as I go. why did I not , now this girl I used to know my freshman year of highschool popped into my head she was cool but now I have a really cool girlfriend, she is the sweetest thing in the whole world, she loves to cuddle which makes me very happy, the movies we have seen pop into my head, now I think I am doing this assignment wrong. well let's see Mrs. dolce, Mrs. angel  I guess we are just supposed to put our thoughts and not dwell on them  my best friend and I playing soccer together, I wonder how he is doing. he moved to LOCNAME. PROPNAME again, PROPNAME, the trial he is working on, the driver  to where ever he wants me to go, notre dame versus purdue, how the guy that  cut my hair didn't know a thing about notre dame, but said he did. PROPNAME and how I think of her all of the time how long this whole little get together on the computer is going to take. I am really not enjoying this because I feel I think about PROPNAME way to much, oh well, I wander where the send button is on this computer. what time will I have to get tomorrow morning so that I can get all of my computer science homework done. I hope PROPNAME and I stick together for a long time. I think she is cool the whole question of love comes up though and I don't know if I love her yet I might but I don't know. I feel very sorry fore PROPNAME, now PROPNAME is in my thoughts, she is cool b but I am already taken so nothing is going to happen there. I am very content. French class really sucks but I am at least  trying, hopefully my teacher sees this and helps me out more than she has in the past. my hair looks pretty cool right after it is cut. I thought I heard someone in the library, Oh well. This whole return thing is annoying. I keep hearing weird noises. The skyline is pretty cool the lights are so numerous. these office buildings really scare me at night, especially when nobody is here, every little  noise makes me jump. well this is very exciting but I only have 00 minutes left,  I am not even half way done. PROPNAME and one of our first dates, what that thing across the river is, I really  hope my care doesn't get a ticket, that would make this day very bad. although this day has been pretty good do far, and it only has an hour left. only one more day before I get to see  PROPNAME. and two till notre dame plays purdue. I am living the good life. pay day is on Friday. my math teacher would make a great LOCNAME clause at one of these malls over the Christmas holiday. I wonder what time I will finally get home. I really cannot wait. this is pretty cool being able to get off work and have  computer access just one floor up. only eight minutes left, I am very excited. there are a bunch of motor cycles outside they are really annoying, but oh well. I still to go home and work on my computer program so that I can just get get her tomorrow and right it up. If I get here at 0 that gives me two hours to do this  lovely project, and I am sure I will be doing the second assignment. I must sound really rude but really I am extremely tired and cranky so I'm sorry if I seem grouchy. I wonder how often PROPNAME thinks about me because I think about her a whole lot. more noises, they are really scary. my nose itches. the green lights are cool on that building across the lake. will it is almost time for me to sign off, if I can only find the send key I would be a happy man. my head is now hurting, I hope teresa's straw project comes out o. k. I wonder what the friends I am going to meet  are like. If they are like her they will be cool. see ya 
__label__label1 well, here I am in my computer lab in kinsolving. I just finished emailing my  boyfriend. I really hate writing him sometimes because he never responds as much as I do. then again he is in LOCNAME and still in high school and probably doesn't have as much to say as I do. oh well that's life. god why the hell did I wait  until the last minute to write this. I should have done this last week. well, then again I did. but the stupid computer didn't send it. so now I have to retype  all that crap again. life sucks! well, it is not that bad, but to me it is. I really  wanted to go home this weekend. my cousins re so stupid for not going. what the hell!! now I have to depend on someone else or I have go to their house this weekend. the last thing I want to do I spend a night there with that stupid sima. damn does that girl have a mouth or what. I can't believe that she made all that stuff up about mayur and me. I hope paras doesn't get mad about me emailing about that. god, he believes everything that I tell him. I know that he is wooped in a way. just because he doesn't drive around everywhere for me doesn't mean that he loves  me any less. or just because I drive to his house a lot, doesn't mean that I  control the relationship. well actually I know that it probably would not have  lasted this 0 months if had not driven up there 00 times. do you know how many miles that is? take 00 times 00 miles each trip. that is a lot of mileage that I put on all the cars. I hope he appreciates everything I do for him. actually, I know that  he does. he is the most perfect person in the world. he has never caused any grief in my life. if anything has gone wrong it is because of his stupid parents. why the hell won't they give him a break? I mean, what the hell is wrong with them? that boy deserves a car more than any other child. I hope to god that comes to LOCNAME next year. that would be the bomb!!! we would be like living together. but I hope we  don't break up like all the other couples that come here and do. they have it made,  don't they realize that!! I guess being around a person all the time can be a  little too much. but that's the thing, I don't think that I could ever get tired of seeing paras. I haven't gotten tired after this long what would change  my mind now. oh well, we’ll see when the time comes. I hope we're still together then. I really don't know what would give either of us a reason to break up. I mean he adores the ground I walk on and I love him for that. just joking. I adore him just as much if not more. I mean, that's why my room is like a shrine to him. anyway, my time is almost up and I have to go get ready for neesh's b-day party thing. what the hell do I wear? I guess I’ll decide in a minute.    
__label__label1 I'm pissed. I just sat here for twenty fuckin' minutes thinking I'm all bad ass and shit, trying to do this assignment and all along I was doing it wrong. Oh well, I really shouldn’t be cussing. I find this rather relaxing in a way. I'm feeling lazy the last couple of days have been very draggy. So right now I'm thinking that I'm a fat, short girl with a high self esteem is that possible? Anyway right now I'm feeling let me think of what I am feeling. I'm feeling exited because I get to go home this weekend. I get to see my boyfriend and family. I was just noticing that I worded that differently. Wrong it's family and boyfriend. I haven’t been home in a while, so it will be great to eat some home cooked food. So do you get some freaked out nutcases in these assignment? I meant to put an 's' but I was too lazy to go back. Yesterday I killed my roommate and her soul will be back to haunt me as I sleep. She was a weird little bitch anyway. I got the kitchen knife and stuck it in her head. I didn't like her head anyway. It was weirdish. And of coarse I'm just joking. I am a pathological, no compulsive liar. Right now I hate my stomach it sucks because it is so damn huge. You see I’m pregnant and it gets in the way sometimes, all the time. That is why I have not been home in such a long time. My dad would strangle me. Yeah so my boyfriend and I had a fling  one night, an unprotected fling and this is how I got in trouble. He then left me because he couldn’t handle the publicity, it would be bead for him. seeing as how he's a politician and all his wife would freak, so I got myself a new boyfriend and now he believes that the baby is his. Men are so dumb!!!!!!!! My roommate is always forgetting shit, it's fuckin' annoying the hell out of me I mean you can't carry a fuckin' convo. with the girl I wish   could kick her ass right here in front of all these ugly people. They can't stop me I'm mega bitch. She wants to go into mass comm. This is my message to her "GOOD fuckin' luck!!!!!!!!" oh well, I’m calm now. well, I was going to go on but it has been twenty minutes . Yes   type very very slow. 
__label__label1 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wonder how many people will start out this writing by stating their name. it seems the logical thing to do since they have just finished typing it and therefore will be thinking about it. I wonder if this assignment is some kind ORGNAME study that our professor is doing. he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and what makes them tick. I wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment. how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line?  I would really like to have access to these writings. I bet it will fascinating to see what people will put down. can any of this be used against me in a court of law?   I am having a great deal of trouble making my computer operate correctly. that is why I am writing this assignment in the basement of jester instead of in the comfort of my own room on the 00th floor. I am worried about having to run down that many steps if there is a fire. the thought of burning to death does not scare me as much as the thought of drowning. that is odd since I am an excellent swimmer and even have worked as a lifeguard. the summer I guarded, I had nightmares about drowning. I don't want to think/write about that anymore. I wonder if PROPNAME write his article for the Texan. I wonder if PROPNAME is mad about the letter I wrote him. relationships are very hard sometimes. I have two hard relationships. one with PROPNAME and one with PROPNAME. gabe is hard to relate at times too. I like PROPNAME more now that I don't have to live with her. I wish that I could just be normal where PROPNAME is concerned. actually that is the problem: I am normal. I am tired of this. I swam laps today. exercise is very good for self-esteem, not because it makes you look better although it does)it just makes you feel better about yourself. I wonder if there is a hormone released when you work hard at something that makes you feel good about yourself. this seems like such a waste of time. I glad to help professor pennebaker get tenure though.  
__label__label0   Okay, I am working on assignment number one in which if I understand correctly, I am to follow my thought pattern. I am thinking about everything that I need to accomplish in the next two or three days. This is difficult to follow because everything seems to run together. This happens to me every night when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes it takes me hours to get there. I have to actually talk myself into clearing my thoughts in order for me to get some sleep. There have got to be some better relaxation techniques that I should try in order to sleep, because I am always tired. When you are always tired, it is difficult to get everything accomplished because your mind and body just do not cooperate. I wonder how much power the mind actually has over the body. Maybe that is something that we will discuss in class. I find the topic very interesting. It is amazing how much more conscientious you become of your thoughts when you are trying to track them. It seems to make you lose some of the negativity or criticism that usually passes through one's mind. It is hard to think when you are trying to, but when you would rather not, you are overloaded with thoughts. Just what exactly are thoughts anyway?  I wonder just how the brain actually thinks. The human mind and body are absolutely amazing. They work so precisely that it is quite intriguing. Life itself is amazingly difficult sometimes. All my life, I have wanted to get big, now I would love to be back in kindergarten. Life was so simple back then,  Now everything is rushed and hurried and there are still not enough hours in the day to get everything done that needs to be done. I wonder how other people seem to do everything with such ease, because I definitely cannot seem to get away with doing anything easily. Maybe I will be a stronger person because of it, or maybe I will be insane by age 00. Who knows? only time will tell. I wish I could see into the future to know whether what I am doing now will pay off or if it is being done in vain. Time, what a concept anyway. I would imagine that the world would be quite chaotic without it, but sometimes I still wish that it would go away. I have been typing for a little more than ten minutes now. look at that, I just used time in a simple statement. The concept of time has probably always existed in some form or fashion, however it could not have always been this exact. I wonder who came up with making it the way it is today and if that person knew what a profound effect it would have on the world. I am already ready for Christmas break. I had an absolutely wonderful summer and cannot quite seem to put summer behind me and get in the going to school mode. I want to do well in my classes. I graduated fourth in my class and had a GPA of over one hundred. I made one B is first grade and swore that I would never make another. I guess college is a different thing though and I will have to wait and see how everything works out. It is quite an adjustment from high school. I was trying to stay away from this topic due to our second writing assignment, but my mind is consumed with thoughts about everything that is going on right now which is moving away and going to this absolutely huge school. There are more people on this campus than there are in my whole town. Anyway, I have been typing for more than twenty minutes now. I think my mind skips around a lot and jumps from topic to topic, but oh well, that is how I work. 
__label__label0 I’m feeling a little stress coming on now, because I’m think about everything  I have to do, but have yet to start it. sometimes I can't resist going out with  friends and that is really bad, because then I don't have time to study. I  don't know what else I’m feeling right now. I’m just sitting in front of a  computer in the pcl and typing along. even though the paper doesn't not need correct spelling and stuff, I still go back and correct it(I guess cause it's a  habit). right now I’m observing people as they walk by. I really enjoy this  assignment, because it helps me to put all my thoughts and feelings on paper,  instead of holding them in ( as what I normally do)  I generally don't like to  tell people my feelings inside, I guess cause I’m very paranoid and I don't  trust others with my personal secrets, even if they were really close friends  of mine. I can't wait until later(0:00p. m. when I go practice my throwing of  footballs. I’m really excited about intramural football. most of the people  on my team are really nice. I’m just a little scared about the real games b/c  I’m afraid that the guys on the other coed I’m teams will run into me and hurt  me. I was really sore this morning, after I woke up b/c of football practice  yesterday morning. football practice was pretty fun. I enjoy going through  all the drills and practices. at first I wasn't too sure about playing I’m  football, but when one of my friends asked me to join her team I was like sure. our team makeup is kinda funny. we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls. I just thought that was kinda interesting. well, I’m looking  at the clock and it seems like I have five more minutes of writing time. right after I do this assignment, I’m going to go study on the fourth floor. I really don't want to be left behind in my classes. I already am and that's  not a good way to start off my college years. in high school I studied  constantly and now I rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on  and I usually give in to my friends when they want to go do something. I  think time really does fly by. before I know it, it's time to go to sleep again I wish I had nothing to worry about. I always wondered what my life would be like  if I was rich. it would be much more relaxing I think. well, it's already been  twenty minutes and I would write longer, but I really have got to go studying. I can't wait until I get to write paper 0, because I have a lot to say about my  college experience so far. 
__label__label0 Homework, I hate homework. no it's not that. It's more like I hate the  obligation to be busy that it entails. Why is it that after finishing homework or exercises that you feel so great, but actually starting it is so stressful. Why is it that something that is so helpful is hard to motivate?  One would  think that lazy people would have been weeded out by natural selection by now  and it'd be easier for those left behind to get motivated. But from what I've  seen in the history texts, people aren't only not more motivated, they're less!! So if this goes on, it'll get harder and harder for people to get things done. And I'm already having enough problems as it is!   It makes me wonder if the human  race will survive to see a true 'space age'?  I mean, We've made so much  progress in that area already, but at the rate that apathy and disinterest that  sweeping through the population, it's quite possible that we'll never get off of our own little mudball in order to see what the other little mudballs circling a bunch of burning hydrogen look like. Not only that, but what about all these  alien theory's?  There is a truism (called that 'cause they're normally true)  that says, "There is a seed of truth even in the most outrageous rumor"  So I  want to know what that seed of truth is!!  What, or who, is out there. If it's nothing, I want to find out. So maybe in my lifetime there will not be any  answers, but from heaven or hell or wherever I go, if indeed I go anywhere other than the ground, I want someone to somewhere figure out the answer!  Or that  there is not an answer. Oh, well. I think my twenty minutes are up. So  hopefully what little motivation I've mustered will result in more than just a  good grade (although that's good too!) 
__label__label1 I really have no idea what to write about. I am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. It feels like I have just been on vacation and am home now. Some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but I took some allergy medicine and I have no desire to dance. The medicine makes me so tired. My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. She only does that when she is upset about something. I guess she misses me. We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. She was a wonderful dog. I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to LOCNAME tomorrow. That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. I had to sell my horse before I left for college. I had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. I still haven't sold all of my equipment. I can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. Princess PROPNAME died in a car accident this morning. I really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but I guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. Anyway, I think it is really really sad. I especially feel so bad for her children. I was watching 00 Minutes on TV a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. My brothers and I used to fish a lot with the family too. It is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. One of them is 00 and the other one is almost 00. That is hard to believe. I just turned 00 on Friday. It was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. I am also glad I came home because that way, I can be sure that I keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. I want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. I am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. I think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where I used to live in LOCNAME. She told me that a girl I used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. It was so shocking and really sad. I mean, I didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since I had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. My roommate at Towers is really cool. I am glad we get along. I was worried I might get some freak. I can just imagine that if I had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. Twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I think I still have a few minutes left. I think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. Sometimes they are really, really loud. We used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. Well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. It was in the middle of the night and I heard her running around the house like a freak. Finally I got up to see what was wrong and I took the trap off of her. The mouse appeared to be dead so I put it in a baggy but when I got up in the morning, I found out it was still alive so I tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so I put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. It finally got better so I let it go. I had to let it go far away from my house though  because my mom was afraid it would come back in. My cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in LOCNAME. It was so sad. I cried everyday until we finally found her again. I think my twenty minutes is up now. 
__label__label0 I just don't understand some people. Why do guys think that (okay, not all guys) it's okay for them to act like animals?  What does he market?  It's not easy to write and watch television at the same time. It's even harder to write and talk to someone at the same time. That was so disgusting!  Why do girls stay with guys that they don't like?  why am I with PROPNAME?  I think that I love him, but do I really?  I mean how could I do what I did last night if I love him?  It could be possible, I guess. What are these people talking about?  Is PROPNAME. what was I going to say?  quit making so much noise!!!  Clink and clank. All trash is gross. Don't you know that?  My mind keeps drawing blanks. Maybe I am trying too hard to think about what I am thinking. Have you ever thought about how you think of things?  Well, I guess that is what we are doing here. Ha!  This guy is so funny!  This show is very funny today. I cannot believe that that lady just cut her old man's hair off. Why don't people have better opinions about themselves?  Like me. Why don't I?  This thing is annoying. How am I supposed to write my stream of consciousness when this stupid thing says I'm being idle?  I ask a lot of questions, don't I?  When are these twenty minutes going to be over?  Am I going to have to pay PROPNAME to use her computer?  Did I spell her name right?  Who is that lady?  These people act as if they know her. Do they?  Oh!  I guess that she is a comedian. I guess anyway. A man with a plan!  Ha!  My hands are cramping. Come on time!  Go faster!  Faster, faster!  Sock sniffing?  Okay, whatever you say. Alright! Time is over! 
__label__label0 Boy am I hungry right about now. I sure do miss mom's cooking, even though the whole eighteen years I've been eating it, I thought it was gross. Computer are cool. Internet is awesome. I like being a guinea pig for psychology class. Jester food stinks. Man I really hate it. However, the pizzas okay. PROPNAME PROPNAME is cool. I wish I hadn't lost the CD. Racquet ball looks interesting. I want to play intramural Basketball. I wish I had a Car. I wouldn't mind having an ORGNAME ORGNAME. Is twenty minutes over yet?  Guess not. I love ORGNAME. I love                                        PROPNAME. I don't really miss LOCNAME that much. I could live here forever. Man, I'm hungry. I could go for some fried chicken and biscuits with mashed potatoes and gravy. I wouldn't mind have some Cajun rice with that. I want to go  jogging,  but I have too much too read tonight. I should not have registered  for morning classes. It sucks having to wake up at eight in the morning and  dragging myself to class. Wow it has been exactly ten minutes. Apples are good when they are crunchy and sweet. I miss ORGNAME ORGNAME stations. I can't seem to find a good club station in LOCNAME. I miss the clubs at LOCNAME. However, the ones here in LOCNAME Aren't that bad. Corn dogs at Jester are nasty. So far  my classes have been easy, but I haven't had an exam yet or even a quiz. I  don't know what to expect. I had a weird dream last night. I was at a party and every one who was there was a person I had met but not really was good  friends with. However I did not feel uncomfortable,  I even felt like I had  known them my whole life. I like Cajun rice. Red beans and rice is good too. I feel like getting something to eat. I'm starving. My stomach is telling me  to run to the fridge, but my mind is reminding me that it is just empty. All I have to eat is ice cubes I made last night. Man, I'm starving!!!   
__label__label0   Right now I'm thinking how much easier it would be to write assignment  number 0. If there are no right or wrong things to write, I guess I should not worry. I believe I worry too much. It is hard to make this paragraph line up, the ends of each line that is. Right I feel blank but the nice  thing is since I wrote it out, my assignment is not a blank. If all assignments were this easy, I'd worry less. I'm hot, hungry and tired. All a  result of college life I guess. So far, the class has been interesting. I have a feeling the class will get more serious. I generally stay away from computers, technology intimidates me. I like the simple things in life but  the entire world is advancing so I must. For example, I am turning an assignment through the internet. Its pretty crazy to me. My typing is slowing due to an interest in a video that is on and extreme hunger. I be hitting  the submit button now.    
__label__label1 NOTE:  Something happened when I was typing this-the words never skipped down to the next line. (Maybe it's supposed to be that way?!)  Anyway, my thoughts continue to the right-quite a ways. Sorry for the hassle!!   I'm not really sure what this whole assignment is about, but it should be fairly easy for me since I think way too much at times. My thoughts??  I am extremely tired right now. I had a very exhausting weekend and would love to not have classes in the morning. I am doing everything  possible to procrastinate and not begin my huge amount of work. I still haven't really gotten in to the whole college thing. I feel like I am in some kind of dream world-like I it's not really me sitting in a college class with 000 other students. Maybe I was spoiled in high school with classes of only a max of 00 and a graduating class of only 000. Our teachers probably babied us with lots of one-on-one attention-which at the time I loved and appreciated. But NOW I am so overwhelmed!  I'm now only a number out of hundreds of other kids. I guess this whole experience is a big transition no matter what. Anyway, I hope I am doing this correctly. I have no idea why my computer is laying out my words like this. I hate computers!!  We just don’t mix well. I am completely computer illiterate. Sorry if this is taking you longer to read. I am very excited about this psychology class. It happens to be one of my possible majors. Who knows what will happen?!  All I know is that I am a people person and a very good listener that would love to be able to help people in anyway I can. I know it is a tough major with tons of schooling, but it really interests me. I just finished talking to a few of my friends from high school on the phone. They all seem so far away. I miss them and all the fun times we shared. I love reminiscing about our memories, especially looking at old pictures. My walls are full of pictures of friends and family and I'm sure by the end of the year you won't be able to  tell what color the walls are. I miss my family too. 
__label__label1 You know, when typing on a computer, twenty minutes is a long time. Figuring a person types 00 to 00 words per minutes, they will be typing between 0000 words and 0000 words per minute. I wonder if this assignment would be more effective if the students had to write it in pen, so that you could also see how they changed their mind. I know that I have already erased and retyped. I don't mean that I have taken the stream of consciousness out of it, just that I will change my mind on how I want to phrase things. I want this to make sense to any poor, unfortunate person who has to read this thing, and sometimes I takes me a while figure out a way to phrase thing that will accurately get the message of what I am trying to express across. Okay, I have managed to confuse myself with this stuff that I am saying. Somehow I don't consider it to be a good sign when I can confuse myself with something that I am thinking. It's too bad that I type faster than I think b/c right now I can even get all of my thoughts down. Wow, it finally put me on another line!  I don't have any idea what time I actually started typing. I remember looking at the clock at 0:00, but I was already typing then. I guess that I will just count that as my starting time, I am guessing that it really doesn't matter how long I write. Back to the confusing myself thing. you know, I have a habit of confusing myself. I will ask myself questions or think about ideas which really are lacking in logic, or else they have a strange logic. For example, at my high school, I am famous for my opinions about being normal. I once told my friend that I was the only normal person, and that the rest of them were all abnormal. Having said this, I realize that if I am the only normal person, that would make it abnormal to be normal, and normal to be abnormal. This would mean that although I was the only normal person in the group, I was really abnormal b/c it is normal to be abnormal and abnormal to be normal. At first this appears to make no sense, but once you think about it for a while, it starts to make perfect sense, at least to me anyway. And those people who have been blessed enough to hear this theory get it eventually. I have no idea if I am supposed to be writing this thing as if I was talking to someone, but that is really the only way that I can write it. I am used to writing emails a lot like this, and I have a tendency to talk like this too. I will say, or write whatever is on my mind. This  results in a lack of sentences in my emails. I separate the thoughts with little dots. everything is in sentence fragments. I just write what I am thinking at the time. That is why I was so happy about this assignment, imagine, I am getting a grade for doing something that I do all the time!  But then again, it's not like the people I write to hate my emails. In fact, most of them love my emails. My boyfriend, PROPNAME, always tells me how much he loves my emails. And lately, I have noticed that I have been influencing people with the way I write. More and more of my friends have started writing very stream of consciousness emails to me. I like them though, b/c I think that they give a greater insight into how a person if feeling and what they are thinking. I am a terrible speller, and a bad typer too. I can type really fast, but I am not high on the accuracy. Sometimes I do really great, but other times, well. it's embarrassing. I think that in college I am gonna major in typos and creative spelling!  I haven't eaten anything today. It is 0:00 now. I guess after I finish this I will go back to the dorm room and then I will go eat dinner. Or maybe I won't. I am not really that hungry but I feel bad about wasting meal tickets. Last week I didn't eat anywhere near the two meals a day that we bought. I might just go and eat some yogurt that I have in the fridge. The advantage to not eating, and then getting all this extra exercise walking around this school, is that it will help me get in shape. This is ridiculous, it has been 00 minutes and I am only on the [now] fifth line!  You know, I don't like typing. I think that I am a candidate for carpal tunnel. I am exaggerating a bit, but my hands get tired quickly from typing. I think that I strain them b/c the table is too high and therefore I am resting my hands on the keyboard too much. I just moved the keyboard to my lap and that actually helps. I am a semi computer nerd. I know about software, and how to use the web. However, I am not a hacker, and my knowledge of hardware is not the best. maybe average. I can build my own computer, or do anything illegal. but put a program in front of me, and I will either know how to use it, or else I will figure out how to use it fairly quickly. I am glad that this about finished. It is actually tiring trying to keep up with what I am thinking. I just finished psych class and so I decided to stop at the pcl library and do this before I forget. I meant to do these assignments this weekend, but I forgot. actually, I just didn't get time. My best friends online boyfriend came to LOCNAME this weekend, and I am friends with him too, so I wanted to meet him also. He flew in from PROPNAME CA. quite far. We had never met him before now. He is really nice too, only. he is a bit inappropriate acting, in that he was feeling me, and he even French kissed me. he felt on Amber (my friend) too, and kissed her more. but the point is, his hands should only be up one person's shirt. and that is Amber, not me!  I hope that this won't really get published b/c this stuff about PROPNAME is not something that I want everyone to find out about. He was still really nice, and I liked him. just not romantically. I guess maybe he is just like that. I did tell Amber about what happened. I needed to, if she didn't mind(which, for some reason, she didn't), then it's all good. well, 'cept that I don't want him to kiss me, or feel up my shirt or in my overalls. That is why I won't let him do it again. however, I don't know when or if I will see him again, so it may never come up. Anyway, time is up, so I am gonna submit this thing, and hike it back to the dorm. actually the dorm isn't too far!  I might sit outside and read the paper before going back though. It will depend on how I feel. Okay, here it is. hope it was helpful, or served the purpose it was supposed to. 
__label__label1 In the background there is the movie "Space Jam" which is a little distracting. I can't help but focus on the comedy the Looney Tunes attribute to communication disorders because it was a topic that was discussed in my CSD class. It's a little too cold in here. My agent is not paying enough attention to me as of late, in agreement with a statement just made in the movie. I still wonder about my sign language assignment tonight. The screen on this computer is getting out of focus, then coming back in focus again. I love this keyboard. The spacing on the keys is wonderful. I wish my face would stop throbbing. My lips are very dry, and it's still very cold. I can feel the fatness in the side of my face from my surgery. the PROPNAME guy on Seinfeld is in this movie. I hate his character. In Seinfeld he's funny at least. this music reminds me of aerobics and now the ORGNAME are playing "Fly Like and Eagle". PROPNAME PROPNAME is a very attractive man. I wish I lived on campus. I wish I had a boyfriend. I gave the wrong number to my friend. It's hard to pay attention to the assignment and the movie , but it's not my computer so I must make do. no more basketball this season. I love this song, it reminds me of 0th grade and going roller skating. My best friend from 0th grade was really messed up. I wonder where she is now. I need to get the old school Salt 'n Peppa CD. I want a new car. I really want a nice car, not another piece of crap like I already have. I want a new Honda Accord, if life was perfect. I'm glad, this boy is coming over and I am very attracted to him. the movie with PROPNAME PROPNAME in it about basketball. I forgot the name, crap. my head hurts. you know that looking at anything that is emitting light, like a computer screen or a TV with the lights off it is very bad for your eyes. I'm hungry, I need to work out. I love the free rec center. My fingers hurt a little. I love playing sports, I love movies. I want to make movies when I get older, maybe I'll just produce. Actually I want to be rich. God, that mouse is annoying. Reminds me of my little sister, she always talks to fast for her mouth. This movie sucks. I am tired and I have to do that stupid Lab tonight. I want to go to an amusement park. I'm hungry. I miss PROPNAME. I need a haircut. God that's PROPNAME PROPNAME's voice. That trips me out. OK , my fingers really hurt. the chubby boy? Who's voice is that? hey time really flies, it's good to hear PROPNAME laugh. I love it when other people are amused. Why is PROPNAME talking about his butt. My friend PROPNAME called me, it's very cool that I ran into him today. enough. 
__label__label0 so I am going to write this stream of consciousness thing for psychology and I’m worried that someone will come in and think that I’m retarded because I live at home because my parents won't let me go. If they read this they will get very angry with me for feeling this way but I don't understand why they even still try to control the way I feel. I don't really know what to say but I guess that's the whole point of this assignment. Which is not of what I say, but what I think. I hope this typing isn't too bad. Maybe I'll go back later and reedit it but I'll probably get embarrassed or ashamed of how I am. That's weird that I get embarrassed of myself. Maybe I think too much and am hypersensitive or maybe this class will help me understand myself. I was thinking about something that the teacher said earlier about everyone suspecting that they are crazy or abnormal as he put it and that's probably right because I always ask myself and others I trust which are few what is wrong with me. I know that there is something or maybe it's all in my head. I know that if I wanted to I could convince myself that my dad just walked in and yelled at me for shutting the door. What was I saying maybe I should not be at home writing this someone always comes in and opens the door or reads whatever I’m doing. I hate this. not this, just my situation. I'll bet I sound pretty negative right now. I suppose it's because of school and my relatives all dying and my family but everyone's got problems right? I wish that I could talk to a counselor. I don't want to think about myself and try not to thing right now about that. I don't want them to see me cry and come in and yell at me or ask me what's wrong and tell me what to do about it. They don't understand. my being unhappy doesn't help them it just makes them mad at me. why am I so unhappy. why am I writing about this because in class it was said not to write about this stuff. I guess you won't read this like you said until a while from now anyway who knows maybe I’ll be better by then. Maybe I’ll have friends, but my family will still be here. I used to  wish they died but then I thought I’d feel bad if they did. Everyone is dying. As my mother says, it's not normal to be happy all of the time, but of course she married my dad who is the cause of the problem so she is right about herself, but not me. why when I was a child, was I happy more than now. I didn't experience my father as harshly then as I do now. how would she know anyway, she married him when  she was 00 my age. just a kid who didn't know anything made to be a servant to him. wish  I don't even know what I want anymore. I wonder what school will be like tomorrow. what will I become in life does everyone feel like me. they certainly don't show it very much . I walk the halls and it's all so big and impersonal maybe its because I’m younger a freshman or I’m not looking at it the right way. I think that I'm too negative the phone just rang once. I wonder who it is. It's not for me because I don't know anyone I miss high school, that's weird when I was in classes I hated it. I guess I miss my friends. I wonder what he's doing now. I cant think about that it'll only make me worse. Why do I feel this way. I wish I could control my emotions like others and look serious and normal, not afraid. why am I afraid. I  bet you'll think that I’m weird. I don't even care anymore. Why can't they leave me alone. Those psychological tests scared me. It was . like either write a five page paper or do tests. Obviously the kid would rather do tests than do a billion page essay. but who know maybe it will be fun. I just got a call  weird my only friend but I told my sister that I had to go and to tell them bye. Even when I have a friend I can't talk. I just wish that I who is singing. there's no privacy in the house. I wish that I lived in a dorm you shut the door and it makes them want to come in but when you open the door they feel like they can just come in and talk to you. if I shut the door they get curious like that time my dad thought that I was taking drugs in my room what a  jerk. why can't he trust me maybe I am bad I have done nothing that I regret but I guess I should reap what I sow. I hate consequences. who is that . I wish they'd just shut up. why can't UT give scholarships to live in dorms to middle class students they’re so stingy about that now I suffer at home alone traveling to freedom at school alone. I want to have friends but am afraid what if someone walks in and read this. I wish I could shut the door but that would disturb me and my stream of conscious like everyone already has. Who is talking. I don't know why they're all worried I think I need more attention but I don't know how to get it what is wrong with me what is she doing. I  wish they’d all leave. it's nine and I have to wake up early how much longer. I actually enjoy this it's like purging all of the negativity which I have alot of. This is a good idea. I kind of wish I could read other kids stream of conscious to see what they’re like. if they had the same thoughts and feelings that I did. I don't want to revise it you said it would be completion anyway so I don't have to revise. I want to sleep and forget everything all happened for a few hours of nothingness. then start over tomorrow and feel again. People would be so much better off if they didn't feel at all Less war and no jealousy. I hate love and emotions they only hurt you. and others involved. I have a minute left and just in time because my  dad might come in and get mad at me for staying up too late. they’re is never enough time to do anything Why am I negative. I  wish I knew what I wanted. what else do I say or think I start work tomorrow. I wonder if I can handle it or not. what if I fall why do I worry so much I wish I didn't worry. then I’d be fine. who is behind me I hope I meet people tomorrow. I want to get all of my work done so that I can work but it keeps piling up will I ever finish do I have the time I hate being overwhelmed high school was so easy. they didn't prepare me at all. it's too hot. why do I complain all of the time I hope that I am doing this right it's not a grade but it might be. who is that behind me. no matter if I shut this door they open it no privacy no body cares they do but they don't show. that's dumb. What do I say next where are the keys for tomorrow I have to get ready what time is it. that's my timer cool I wish I weren't so tired bye  
__label__label0 that's no good. I was informed as I entered the room that my friend tom's  girlfriend broke up with him. they were engaged;  I hope he comes  through this ok. he gets depressed sometimes,  and uses poor judgement. wow . . . it just occurred to me the more complex problems I face as I age. there's a  volleyball game going on outside in the jester courtyard (I assume . . . tom's roommate insists that it's a drunken festival of debauchery - I can't see out the window). I find their play loud and distracting, but the courts are there for that  purpose and I have no right to complain. the stereo turned off and I find the only noise in the room to be that of my typing. I like music as I work. it  helps me to concentrate. I find that I’m considerably addicted to sound. when I was younger (and not paying an electric bill) I even needed music to sleep. I listened to my  Beatles record whi0le I cooked dinner tonight. chicken fried steak,  mashed potatoes and abbey road  -  fantastic combination. I found that there's a slight scratch  on "Mr. mustard"  -  those bastards at the record shop are supposed to be honest about the condition of the albums . . . it would be easier had they allowed me to  listen to it before I bought it. what kind of record shop has no turntable?  still, I’m glad to have it - I collect old vinyl from some of my favorite groups . . . certain bands have a different sound and feel on record. I started collecting  when my brother bought me "working man's dead. "  he originally inspired my interest in the grateful dead,  I guess that fits. I have discovered in the past few years  just how, in my younger days, I religiously aspired to be like my brother. he's a great guy . . . I’m glad that he's succeeding in life - we went through some troubling stages together. I miss him when I’m at school. it's been five years since we lived in the same house,  but at school I’m 000 miles away rather than across town. tom's talking on the phone to one of our friends,  PROPNAME,  who goes to school  at LOCNAME. computers are amazing things - my phone bill would be outrageous if I couldn't e-mail my friends who attend school in other states. he's talking about the "break-up" now. this whole situation sucks. 
__label__label1 It is now 00:00 and so I cannot wait until 00:00 because at that time my writing will be done. I type slowly anyway so I shouldn’t have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. I am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact I am hungry and stressed out. The first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. I am in college and at this point I need to get my priorities straight. I am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. My mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. I need a job, but I’m so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. I am not the proudest to be in a sorority. Don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but I don't like the whole association that comes with it. My whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. In fact, I like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  I love Austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between ORGNAME and here. There are so many interesting people and I want to get to know them all or at least try. Wow, it's already been over 00 minutes and this has not been too hard. I used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven’t had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why I have been able to do this, and express myself so well. I enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why I write so much-journal, letters, poems. It helps me gain a sense of relief and since I don' express my feelings out loud too often, I need to do this daily, if not more so I can release all that I feel. I am excited about doing psychology this year because I hope to decide between the two majors I am struggling with. I am at the moment down for premed/nutrition and I really do want to go into medicine, but I've also always been interested in criminal psychology. It may be a little depressing, but I find it very interesting, and definitely want a job I love. A few months back, I read Helter Skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so I am hoping this class will help with my decision making. I guess we'll see. It is 00:00 now and time for me to stop. 
__label__label1 Well I'm not sure what to start talking about. It's taken forever just to get this assignment started. I had to set up an if account and all that before I could  start. I hate coming to new computer labs, this one is new to me because I just transferred here. I feel totally computer illiterate, so I start to feel like an idiot when the lab people have to go around with me and me  figure it all out. But anyway, I'm here now doing it, and I guess you always learn something from these situations. I learned that I need to get my own account set up from my computer in my room, so then I don't have to worry about coming up here and dealing with this. I guess we are just supposed to tell you what we're thinking about and our thoughts as they change. Well all I keep thinking is I wonder what you are going to think about my thoughts and ramblings when you read this. Maybe you'll enjoy it because I sound paranoid and you can analyze me! ha ha I'm looking out the window now at the trees, wishing I was out there and not working on this assignment. I still have fifteen more minutes to write. I wonder what everyone else here is working on. I'd rather be here doing this than doing the physics equations I was working on before I got here. Psychology is so much more interesting than the other sciences. Well now I have an E-mail account. I never had one before. I think it will be fun to be able to send and get mail. Especially because my boyfriend still lives in LOCNAME and its getting expensive calling each other every day, but it wouldn't be the same not to here his voice. I've never really been in the ORGNAME before, I registered here but I haven't ever been in here to do any work. I probably should have been in here before now though! I think the chairs are to too low or maybe the desks are too high, its just not that comfortable. I guess they want you to sit up and have good posture like they taught you in typing class. There, I lost my cursor for a while. I guess that’s why it says - Who knows I. Well I have to help cook dinner at my co-op tonight, we are having LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wonder what that’s going to taste like, good I hope. Well my time is just about up  so I guess its time to submit my paper. I hope you never read these but even if you do I guess I won't really matter because with the size of our class you don't know me from PROPNAME!  
__label__label1 Okay. I'm in the stupid SMURF lab. there are so many people here. I saw PROPNAME downstairs. Sometimes he worries me. He met a new guy the other day and already had sex with this guy. I don't know if he used protection or not. but it worries me. He's so. so. spontaneous about things. I don't ever really know if he thinks things through. He just does as he pleases which isn't a bad thing. but it can be dangerous. I wish he'd just look at himself and what he's doing and decide if it's the right or wrong thing to do. He doesn't need to be going around having sex with whomever whenever. He knows and I know that he's a whore. It's not a surprise to anyone. But, he doesn't care. so it seems. Of course, I call him a whore jokingly but in a way I'm serious about it. He knows what can happen to him and it sucks that he doesn't care. Man. Men!!! Men suck! PROPNAME needs to realize that I will never be with him again. He thinks things will change. he's so wrong. For two years I had to put up with his shit and all his lies. There is no way in hell I'd ever even give a second thought to going back out with him. He knows he's an asshole and I let him know that a long time ago. How dare he even bring up the idea of us getting back together. He's a 00 year old trapped in a 00 year old's body. He has no idea what a good relationship is and he doesn't know the meaning of trust. He needs to grow up and realize that he can't always get what he wants. and when he can't get it he needs to just give up and move on with his pointless life. I've moved on and he needs to realize that. I'm not there to be at his beck and call and I'm not there to just be there when no one else is. He lost whatever respect I had for him a long long long time ago. Why is it that I always seem to get stuck in the worst situations when it comes to relationships? Hell. let's see my record thusfar: hmmm, PROPNAME is the asshole, PROPNAME was just a jerk, PROPNAME is the only man I ever loved and he's in LOCNAME, PROPNAME was someone that I could consider a "summer love". but he's at another college. Well, screw it!!  I need to concentrate on getting all A's and B's this year so I can get that free plane ticket to anywhere in the LOCNAME. Plus, I get $00/A!!  I need the money. I'm poor now and I have bills to pay!  Damnit all to hell. bills!!!  Responsibility!!  Yeah, I have responsibilities as an adult but I don't think the 'rents realize that. I'm 00 years old. 00 in April. yet I'm still a little girl who can't do anything right for shit according to them. What the hell do they know?  I'm not living with them now and they don't see how hard I work to get where I am and how hard I try to be social, to get the education I need, and to get a job worth having in this freakin' town!!  It's hard to find a job. but I've done it. And what do they say when I tell them this?  "that's nice". What is that? Why don't they just tell me how they really feel. "Oh, well, that's still not the real world so it doesn't count"  I swear they piss me off. My mom is the worst. She wants to lecture me about dishonesty and all that shit. Well, HELLO! Guess who's fixin' to eat her words!! I caught her smoking this past weekend. Yep. right there by the side of the house puffin' away like a chimney. What was that you said mom?  You quit smoking?  Right. and I was so proud of you!  All that's blown to hell now. So, I caught her. and what did PROPNAME "PROPNAME, I can't trust you" do?  Well, she decides to kiss my ass to try and make up for her lie. Yes sir! She bribed me with four 00-minute phone cards and $00. OH and she even told me that I could just pay for my speeding ticket without having to take the class. . Yes, that means it would go on my record but "oh, that's okay. it's not much more on your insurance. Besides, we just got a load of money back from the insurance company because of our good  driving records". Oh yeah. she was brown-nosing BIG TIME. I have lost a lot of respect for her for doing that. I don't know whether I should just forget about it and let her do what she will or tell my dad and have him deal with it. I swear. this world is nothing but a big mass of contradictions! I'm not saying that I'm perfect. but I've learned over the past few years about what I want out of life and what I don't want. I'm living my life the way I want to. as stress-free as possible and as happy as possible. When I'm put into these stupid situations it just makes life that much harder and it sucks!  I'm so tired of looking at this computer screen. I think it's about time for me to stop thinking. Yep. it is about that time. Thank God. Now I have to go help PROPNAME with his Spanish work that he swore was gonna be "SOOOO EASY". I knew he'd have trouble. and I knew he would turn to me. I'm no bilingual. but what the hell. I do what I can to help my friends out. I've been called "too nice"? How the  hell can someone bee "too nice"????????? 
__label__label0    I really like doing this assignment. I did it in my senior AP English class many times. I think the assignment was really interesting to my teacher, and that is why we did it so often. I am having a little trouble with this one though because there isn't  rally a topic. My English teacher would usually give us a vague topic, just something to get us started. Some of the topics were going to college or music or sports or something like that. My favorite topic was always music. I think music may be the most important thing to me other than loved ones. I listen to it a lot and it makes me very happy. It is very important to me. But I think what makes me the most happy is playing the guitar. I love creating music. I think it is very gratifying. I may not always play real well, but I am always making some sort of music, even if it sounds terrible. The guitar is probably a kind of escape for me. I really forget about everything else when I am playing. It makes me feel so good. But I think I can do some of m best thinking when I have the guitar in my hand. I f I am just sitting there strumming the guitar it kind of clears my head. So I guess the guitar serves many different purposes for me. Lets see. I am trying my hardest not to write about college. It is very hard since it has pretty much consumed my life for the last two or three months. It is mostly because ever since I started getting ready to move there has been so much stuff to do. I am really being distracted by the television that is on in my room. I have terrible study habits that I need to break as soon as possible before I get to far into college. I was able to breeze through high school without studying, but I know I won't be able to do that in college. Of course sport center is on so it is very hard for my to resist. I know that I watch too much sports. I will really watch anything. 
__label__label0 My roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while I'm typing this. We played basketball for about two and a half hours. For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in LOCNAME. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in LOCNAME the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE. I can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. It kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up. 
__label__label0 I wish I had a car though, but I think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until I can afford one. But I will always get by, I know. Well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so I still have to wake up at 0 am even though I have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. Well I didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. That's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her ORGNAME so maybe just maybe she can come to LOCNAME and live somewhere around here. I wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. Anyway, I'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. It's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 00 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 00 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. Just kept on saying "Can you feel that!" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. I guess that's the focus to my whole life. Not sure if that's good or bad or what. Probably what got me in trouble last semester when I was half way thru the semester. Pretty crazy that I'm my worst enemy, but in a way, I guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if I didn't kick my own butt to do better who would?  So I just keep on chugging. I don't know why I'm so success driven?  Lord knows I'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but I never can seem to do that. Try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. Oh well. I'll probably grow out of it (please please please). So enough of that, I hope the ORGNAME have lost against ORGNAME because then I get to email my Ag friends and laugh. But then again that might not be the greatest idea if the Horns don't fair that well this year. Don't know what I'm listening to on the radio now. Oh yea ACDC!! Rock on! Anyway, I loved that PROPNAME PROPNAME movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. Movies, that's a topic. I love going to see movies. Just like the escape I guess. Thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with Kevin Spacy Usual Suspects, that movie was great. Also, that Primal Fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe. I was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past Friday (yes I was a pathetic party pooper but I did manage to do some socializing). Anyway I get these movies and come home. Now I'm already disappointed because I have this great new TV in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but PROPNAME thru a lot of colored snow. So I figure I'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. But NOOOOOO, the VCR is goofed or something. It may have something to do with the tracking, but I don't have the tape anymore so I can't experiment. I'm usually very good which technical things. I knew everything about my first VCR before it came out of the box. But last Friday was definately not my day (triple low I've heard it called). But oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (MOM's) sauce so that was good. Not a complete loss. Man I would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. So anyway, I have 0 minutes or so to type. I have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. Tell you anything about me?  Actually, I'm a pretty neat ship keeper; I do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of  course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) TV box. But until the cable guy comes on Wed. , it'll probably stay there. I have to make sure that I can support my mother beginning this summer because I think she may need it at some point. Wish I had a godsent car that would work and then I could probably swing insurance payments and gas, but with car payments it'd be too much. Oh my, listening to Eye of the Tiger, how old is that?!?!?! So, maybe I should just go to sleep after writing this. I need to go see if I can to the pretesting for this class, but I tried before this and couldn't get it to load up. Something about the server being down. Well, such is life. I think I should do pretty good this semester, shooting for a 0. 0 again. Got to stay in head of my brother, we are so competitive, he's a yr behind me but transfered in with a bit more credit than I did, and with leaving mid-semester last yr, he's got a good chance to stay pretty close. Times up, bye now!!!  
__label__label0 Adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in "having a good time" have all been fairly easy to get used to. Meeting new people has been exciting and the "name game of trying" to remember everyone I have met has been a challenge. This Labor Day weekend I saw the huge different between high school and college as I decided to take a road trip with three other friends to LOCNAME, a popular Labor Day hangout. I don't know if it was the college parties that made  the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. Seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. One thing is for sure those times are over and  getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. This weekend has also showed me that I am a very patient person. My roommate PROPNAME has shown this to me. Having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. If I am still sane at the end of the year I think that I will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with PROPNAME. I feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. O, I almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 0. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. Basically I hope to work hard and play hard. 
__label__label1 Tonight I get to go to a date dash function with my new sorority. Some of my friends set me up with a guy that I have never met before. I can't wait to meet him. I hope he is nice and at the same time, good looking!  This week has been good. All my classes are going well, so I feel confident about them and life in general. Lunch today was especially good, since I haven't eaten a real meal in a few days. I love college. It's so good to not have to worry about a curfew and letting my parents know exactly where I am going to be, etc. I love my roommate, and we have almost the same schedule, so that works out perfectly. Last night, I typed an extrememly long letter to a friend that I hadn't talked to in a few weeks, so my fingers are still kind of tired from typing then. That's ok, though, because I am getting some homework done early, so that I don't have to worry about it later on. That is definitely a good feeling. I am also feeling excited because I saw two guys on campus this morning that I know from high school. Ever since the first day of classes, I had been wanted to see someone I knew. It just happens that those two that I saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that I know. Lucky me!  This gum that I'm chewing is from a blow pop that I finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. Those things never last long at all. I have a problem with one of my classes. see, I swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and I want to continue in college, but every time I want to do something, the class is in the way. I've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. That is very stressful. I don't know if I should change it to an early time because then, I would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. But then at least I'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. But would I have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like I usually do?  No, I don't think I would. Let's see. which is more important?  I guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. I just don't know. WOw, I have like nine minutes left. THis isn't such a bad assignment. Psychology is actually really fun. I've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. I hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because I'm not that great at analyzing and stuff. I took psychology in high school, and it was way different. My teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. It was the easiest class ever!  I am going home to LOCNAME this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. We are all going to go see PROPNAME PROPNAME, my favorite country singer. My ex-boyfriend will also be in town. I haven't seen him in over two months. He goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME and had to leave in late June. I talk to him every once in awhile, but I miss him so much. We are still great friends, and I can't wait to see him again. We dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. This gum is really ready to be thrown away, but I'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. I have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. Those are never stressful, since the T. A. just helps us with some problems like our homework. He's a nice guy. The first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but I'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. At least I hope so. Getting to know people is good, but I really needed some help with a couple of those problems!  Well, I guess it has been twenty minutes, so I better go. Hope anyone who reads this is having a great time!  :) 
__label__label0 the reason for that is because of this girl I'm interested in. this relationship has had a lot of problems, but nothing I can really do about it. this girl is someone that my roommate dated last semester. I was with her at the end of the semester and I felt that things were pretty good. now my roommate still likes her and tries to make moves on her. this guy is a real good friend of mine too. because of this I don't want to be serious about this girl. I think she really likes me, but then I feel guilty about what I'm doing. she's the kind of girl that has a lot of guy friends. I went to a club last night and she was there. I was dancing with her and felt bad because my roommate was there also. I felt so bad I sort of pushed her away whenever she got close. during that night she also danced with my roommate and other guys. all those guys danced real close to her which made me made me feel real sad. I don't have the right to be jealous because we really are not together, but emotions are too hard to control. I just wish I could hold her and be with her, but the situation is just too awkward. 
__label__label1 it is 0:00 right now and I have to write for 00 minutes. my roommate is going to come in here and read this and make fun of me. she said she would be home at 0;00 I bet it will be a lot later. damn, I'm really bad at typing, iwish I did't have to look at the keyboard while I did this. I wonder who will be reading this thing. I would really like to read someone elses. I hope after this I can get back on that pretesting thing because it sure as hell wasn't working for me earlier. what if I can never get back on it. I'll probably fail this class. man, I just got a call from someone at atm. I could see it on the caller id. shit, that means I'm going to have to calle them back and pay for the long distance. I couldn't answer it and let it skrew up my thinking process. ireally wonder who is going to read this. I wonder how much more time I have. I don't want to look at the clock that will make it seem worse. I wonder what my parents are doing. I bet they're pretty bored. I really suck at typing maybe I should take keyboarding class or something, am I going to run out of room here? it looks like it, oh no ican keep going. I feel like doing something fun. I wish bryce would stop calling so damn much. watch him get on line and be able to read this. iwonder if thatsa possible. I bet you have to know my social security number or some thing. but the university knows it. I wonder if the computer is like timing me or something. my mom would be really proud of me for doing this she doesn't think I know what I'm doing when it come to computers. my roommated will also be impressed when she come home from whereever she is. I bet this would be a lot harder to do in that class room with 000 people. iwould probably start writing about the people around us. by the time I finish a sentence I've already thought about 00,000 other things. I wonder if other peoples are going to be like this. they are probably going to talk about something worthwhile. I used to think it was worthwild. I hear voices outside my window I wonder if they can see me. they're probably saying that girl looks at th e keyboard when she type instead of the screen. wow time is going by really fast, I only have like 0 more minutes. I wonder what will be done with this and if I will ever see it again. where the hell is lindsay? I think I'm starting to get a crick in my neck. I have 0 more minutes. computers are pretty fun I wish I didn't have such early classes. I keep thinking some one is going to knock on my door. geez my suitemate is really weird. I wonder what she does. damn almost all my thoughts from 00 minutes recorded. that is pretty cool. shoul;d I read over it? 
__label__label1 Why must it be so hard?   Why must I live like this?  Would it not be better if I simply throw away my life?  It would be so much easier. I wouldn't have to worry all the time about people's criticism. I wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes. But then, I'm human am I not?  Aren't we social creatures?  If I seperate myself from others, would I not cause myself harm?  Would I not also cause others pain?  A life lost is a gift lost. It is so difficult for me to live like this. Always in pain. But sometimes I gain a sense of glory when I live through the sufferings. It's as though these sufferings are meant to makme stronger. Like steel being tempered in a hot flame. Yet, there's still more pain to come. Will I survive?  surely there will be a point when I will not get stronger and break. But then how will I know where my limit is?  whether I live a mediocre life or on to te fullest, I will die. However, it seems as though the latr fashion of life is better. Therefore, with spirit, I will strive to live out that lifestyle. I try each moring, to fight the tempatations and do what is expected of me. If I live this way and think that it is the best way. Should I not persuade others to do the same?  Why not?  It seems that if everyone lived their life more fully, mankind will be more efficient and fruitful. We will  prosperous as  whole. But if I were to tell this opinion to others, someone will tell me that I should respect their opinion that they can do what ever they wish. But if it is right to repect all the opinions of all people. Would there not still be a conflict which contradicts that opinion that says that we all must respect the opinion of all?  For example, what if someone else's opinion is that people should not accept all opinions as truth. Would not the opinion of the person saying that we should respect all opinion be contrary to that opinion?  This brings about a lot of contradictions. Hence, notall opinions are to be respected.           
__label__label0 I am almost five hundred miles from home, and I don't know anyone here. I'm not sure that what I feel is loneliness because I'm constantly surrounded by people here at the dorm, but I just don't feel at home here yet. People here are very nice, and I know everyone else is in the same position as I am in, but I really feel that this place isn't for me. I really want to go home so I can be around the people I grew up with and feel at home with. I have many regrets about coming here away from all my friends and family, but then again, I realize that ORGNAME is a great school, and my educational background will be greatly benefited. I suppose it's worth the sacrifices in the long scheme of things. Maybe it is better for me to be here away from everyone else, as it should help me become much more independent and learn how to function alone. I've already learned a lot in the week since I've been here, and I feel that I've grown up a lot. I've had to do everything for myself, and force myself to go out and meet new people. My trust issue has become worse here, however, because I used to trust almost everyone, and now, I'm not sure who to trust and who not to trust. I know that if I can just stick it out for a while that I'll grow to love this place because I love learning and new experiences, and I'm definitely going to get both of those things here at LOCNAME. I can always transfer back home next semester if I don't adjust here well. I love the people here because they all seem so friendly. I do feel that I'll eventually make many new friends and this place will seem like home. I cannot sleep or eat here yet. I think it's just the adjustment phase. I have nightmares when I try to sleep, so I've grown accustomed to very few hours of sleep each week. I have no appetite, and every time I try to eat, I get this very sick feeling. I'm seriously hoping both of these feelings will go away soon. Maybe that is just due to being homesick and not being in a place where I feel comfortable yet. I want to go home for the long weekend, but I think that will make it much harder when I come back. I don't think I'll want to leave my home again to return here. Maybe it's just the people I left behind that I miss, but I think mostly it's always knowing someone everywhere I go there that makes me feel comfortable back in my hometown. On top of these things, my ex-boyfriend calls often here, and that makes it very difficult. We're still best friends and tell each other everything. The only reason we're not together now is because of our different college choices, and talking to him makes me want to return home even more. We do plan to get back together as soon as we graduate, but that's a long time from now, and not seeing him often is going to be very hard for me. I've known him for 00 years and relied upon him for everything. I went out with someone else this past weekend, and I felt very bad for it. Even though we're not together, I know that he's the one I want, and I wonder if it's wrong to even date other people if I know I still love him and always will. It's made me feel bad when I talk to him, and I even told him about it. He says it will all be ok, but I just don't know. I'm so confused. There isn't a simple answer to anything I try to do here, and everything I do seems to have some kind of drawback to it. Maybe if I sink myself into my studies, I will not forget, but maybe set aside the hurt that I feel right now. I think I should give that a try, and maybe start a rigorous exercise program so that I will be more tired at night, which might make me get some more rest and increase my appetite a little bit. Maybe I should try to get out of this building. It seems very cold and uninviting, and I think another place might be better for me. Well, I know that with my faith in God that everything will work out for the best if I just put my complete effort into it. It's all for the best! 
__label__label0 I've spent my second day at the university of LOCNAME and I'm trying not to hate it. I feel lonely and depressed. I miss PROPNAME, I miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when I first went to PROPNAME I hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now I know what the other extreme feels like, I really miss it. I kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when I was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in LOCNAME. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people I know. I feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. I can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if I'll like them, because I don't see anyone who fits my idea of what "friend" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with PROPNAME yesterday because I didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- I say that joking of course, but I guess I feel like I can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - I mean I know who she is and it's what I expect. I'm so glad she came here too - I don't know what I would do if I were totally alone down here. I think it's really a different experience for me because I've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here I don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. I didn't expect to miss PROPNAME so much. I thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone I've seen is the sorority/frat type and I hate it!  I never thought PROPNAME was that diverse or funky, but I guess I've realized what I had all along. maybe I'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. I mean I know there are plenty of PROPNAME PROPNAME oh-so-perfect women at PROPNAME who drive me up the wall, but I know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say?  I just had an argument with my mom and I feel really guilty, I haven't seen her a lot lately and I was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how I should rrahhhh - I hate that. I told her that I was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me I can't do it, right when I'm in the middle of an assignment. I'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. I'm at acc where I worked this summer and I came here because 0-I have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 0- I thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like I still mattered to someone. now I just feel like hell. I think I want to cry, but I always feel so crappy when I do that - since I usually do it for some really stupid reason, like I feel like a jerk or something. god, I just feel like telling everyone to shove it today!  what a way to start the semester!  ok, I'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. I'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but I hope I can. I really want PROPNAME to go, but I'm not sure if I want to want him to go. I hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, I'm sick of getting hurt. I think I might just like him because he's there and I'm feeling so lonely right now. I don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal?  I'm not sure. I keep going over this in my head - why can't I find the right one?  not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that I really like/  one that fits all the qualifications I want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. I'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, I can't fully concentrate on what I'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there. 
__label__label1 I just ate and am full. I feel a little stressed trying to write in a flow and finding enough things to write for 00 mins. This is probably one of the strangest things I've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting  I'm so excited to major in it. I'm having a bad morning, because I slept late and now I feel that my whole day is ruined. It's so weird to be doing homework like this, I guess I'm just not used to this. I'm so glad this class is so different. I also love philosophy too. I really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. This is such a pivotal moment in my life, as I embark on college life. Right now I'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. I feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as I click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. I'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and PROPNAME keeps talking on the phone. I get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. Right now I'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and I cannot concentrate. She's always with him, and I can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and I'm sad because were growing apart, and I can't stop it from happening, and I'd really like to. He's so perfect, but I'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because I love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, so I may just lay a passive role in the relationship until I can settle things in my mind. I feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. I have so many confusions and distractions here. My friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. I loved this guy as a friend,  but I've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. I got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing I was upset about was the fact that I have to ruin a Saturday in defensive driving. This assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. I'm really worried that when I finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because I accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done. My very first assignment , and I've probably already messed it up. I guess I'll have to explain the problem to the professor, and hope he understands that I've never used the internet before, and I am an idiot for messing up. well I guess I'll end on this paranoid note, because I really want to do well, and make a 0. 0 this semester. No one believes me, but I have high hopes and determination, and I won't let them bring me down. Well I guess I didn't end on such a bad note after all, but if that's what you need to make it, then I guess I'll end up ok after all 
__label__label0 of course maybe today is a good day because I am feeling such a flood of emotions at the moment. and this will probably be a good release, you know? I don't know I have been kind of down lately. maybe it is this new university environment. I'm having difficulty adjusting I guess. it's all kind of overwhelming. too many things at once. I really wanted to call mauricio and talk about what happened in LOCNAME. stuff that shouldn't have happened between us, but it did nonetheless and it really shouldn't have but I am also kind of glad in a way that it did. but instead of calling him like I wanted too I called randy. I hadn't talked to him for three weeks I guess. I want to talk to him about what happened in LOCNAME also, but I can't. I just can't. it would just cause more unneeded problems I am afraid. so I called him, he was a bad mood as usual lately. I had already been feeling poorly lately and talking to him while he was in that mood wasn't such a good idea it's just that he is one of my best friends and I want to know what is going on in his life. I realize he is having a hard time right now, but he I don't know. I just wish he was more excited to talk to me or something. instead he just upsets me more, and that on top of everything else just makes me cry. crying is a good release though. but I didn't want to. so being like that I wanted to call mauricio even more and sort out some things with him so that would be one less overwhelming thing to deal with right now, but I agree with PROPNAME and think I should wait for him to call me. but I don't know if I am going to be able to. but I will try. I called my step-mom instead. she immediately knew something was wrong with me. I really miss my mom. LOCNAME, my friends, the life I had there. it was so great looking back on it. but I don't want to think that the best years of my life have already passed, I want to think that future holds so much, that I have so much to look forward to. I believe I do I just need to get past this emotional slump I have been in. but it is kind of difficult. I really miss mauricio. I wish he were here in LOCNAME. I feel like right now he is the one I should talk to about everything. I wish I knew how he felt, I just wish he would call me. PROPNAME, thinks I should go and buy a new telephone cable among doing other things. she thinks that if I had regular internet access I would be a whole lot happier. it's not that I not happy. I don't want to be a depressed person, I want to be a happy responsible in-control person. not a sad depressed one that no one want s to be around. I don't think I am usually. I just am in a bad situation lately I guess. I am letting too many things get to me and drag me down. I need to focus on what is important and do one thing at a time. and not get so overwhelmed. I think going home next weekend will be a good break for me as well. I didn't think that I would miss it so much, but I do. a lot actually. I just want to feel my normal comfort level. to know what is going on, although I do not want to be in high school. I just want to be able to I don't know be normal. I thought I would be here, but I am not. I don't know how people do it. how they cope. I think I am lot weaker than I thought. I don't mean that. I don't know what I think. I think that I am almost done with this assignment. it has almost been twenty  minutes. I can't believe it. I thought it would take forever. but I guess it really didn't. hopefully I will talk to mauricio soon. I now I have been focused on him a lot. but it's hard not to be. of course I might not see him for a long time, but. let's not think about that right now. 
__label__label1 this job is going to drain me if I don't say something to these people I think they're too spoiled 0 minute almost done okay want to go home oh but yeah I need to check pretesting this is the longest minute okay bye. 
__label__label1 They are playing the ORGNAME ORGNAME. They're good but I think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. There closing pitcher, something like, LOCNAME is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to PROPNAME PROPNAME of the ORGNAME. I'm really hungry right now. I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in LOCNAME. LOCNAME has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in LOCNAME. I love LOCNAME and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to LOCNAME for my grandmother's 00th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 00 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. 
__label__label0 I can't stand how removed the users are from the control of the system. With internet explorer I can't even get it to work with trumpet Winsock, so if I want to use IE then I have to go down to the computer center and pay them a bunch of money for the ORGNAME connect system when I already have trumpet Winsock that has always worked fine in the past. now with ORGNAME I keep having a completely different problem, there are several times that I go to web pages that I know are there and they aren't for example I tried to go to the pretesting WebPages and I soon as I sent my social security number out over the web, which I'm not especially happy about having to do, it tells me that the document has no data. The same thing has happened before when I try to log on to the ORGNAME house website. I consider myself a pretty smart person, but I cannot figure out at all what the hell is going on with this stupid then. I know I have to go down to campus and use a computer down there for 00 minutes to do the pretesting. and why the hell is it when you connect to UT and go on the web the connecting is so freaking slow. I swear UT must have some really outdated equipment down there because my download speeds never get over 0 K. that's ridiculous. but this is the way at UT. When you go to a school with 00000 students everything takes a little longer and your chances of having to deal with an idiot are raised considerably. I think I have an especially low tolerance for stupid people. Uneducated is different but there seem to be a lot of people out that that are truly student I think, and they frustrate the hell out of me. It's not that I'm a genius of something, but there are some real idiots out there. There is this girl in my engineering economics class that sits up in the front and will ask questions that make no freaking sense at all. How in the hell does someone get to be an upper division engineering major and be so stupid. obviously it happens through, although most of the really stupid people that I have to deal with come from working at ORGNAME. I guess that's my own fault, it's not like I should expect anything else. When I was a ORGNAME we would have some cashiers that I have not idea at all how they got hired. I think personnel hires anyone with a pulse sometimes, I mean if the person sitting across the table from you just has this completely blank look on their face, that's a good sign that you shouldn't hire them. Another thing that bugs me are all the stupid laws regarding alcohol in this country. I mean either it should be legal or it should, but alcohol seems to be the only think that is legal to some of the adults and only part of the time. I mean were are talking about adults, some of them may not be especially bright but they still are adults. if 00 is good enough for every thing else then it should be good enough for alcohol. you can get married, go to jail, go to war, own property, get a gun, hell anything that any other adult does except drink. seems pretty backwards to me. something else that is freaking stupid and at the very least unfair is the way that car insurance companies can completely screw over guys. when a girl turns 00 she gets a good rate, but a guy has to wait until he is 00, hello but most of the really awful drivers that I have ever been around are women, they are  the ones that pay no attention at all to what is going on around them. but since older people control the laws etceteras the younger people are going to continue to get screwed over, I think they should make people over 00 pay the same rates as 00 year olds, that would be funny. oh well out of time, it's been real 
__label__label0 I don't have enough time in my day for important schoolwork, studying, work, rest time, AND enough sleep to make me feel good. I haven't even left myself enough time on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for lunch. What was I thinking making those work hours for myself. I gave myself 00 minutes to get to class. I have to wake up in the morning and work from 0 until whenever I get off to get to class in 00 minutes. that's no time to even stop and think or do an errand here and there. I had to go home this weekend to get a bunch of homework and studying done. I have one of the busiest weeks this week. Everything seems to be due on the same day, but thankfully not the same hour. When can I sleep?  I have to write four menus for four dinners of twenty people and write the ingredients list and have everything organized and typed. At least I can type and work here late at night. it is a getaway from my hot house and hot room. I should stay here all night one night. it's so cool and comfortable in here. I have to clean sometime today in between classes. the only reason I have time for anything now is because I didn't work today. I had to wake up with not enough sleep and I didn't even work today. I guess it's good though because I'm getting this and the pretesting done and that's important. I wonder if we get some sort of receipt for doing this like we are supposed to in the pretesting. I hope so it would be my luck that it doesn't get submitted. if someone is reading this, it was submitted. I wonder if anyone is actually reading this. it makes me so mad and frustrated with the mail system. it's always the really important letters and mail that gets lost. why did it have to be  that letter that got lost?  I have to go to some building to get my password for receiving email because I can't remember my password. I have to also pick up my financial aid check. maybe it's in the same building. I can't help correcting my errors as I type. it's a habit thing. my finger automatically goes to the delete key when I see an error. at least now I can what was I typing??? I think faster than I type and I type pretty fast, but as I type one thing I'm thinking of something else. it's weird to write down what you think. I don't usually think "oh I'm thinking about this" I just think. thought just go through my head. usually the thoughts that I really hear are the worried and stressed out thoughts because I know I'm slacking already and what is it like the 0rd week of school? has it been 00 minutes yet?  when you watch the time, it goes so slow. maybe that's what I should do to savor my time. just watch it. if I could watch a clock as I sleep it would be perfect. my sleep time would be good and long. well it's been twenty minutes. it makes me feel good that I got this done. that's one thing on my long list of things to do. What if they don't like my menu for the week?  it's too boring. the menu for this week has so my variety. oh I don't care. I have to stop thinking or I'll never stop writing. 
__label__label0 So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking. Ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a "social smoker. "  I have told him how I feel and asked that he at least not smoke when I'm around because I refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. Besides, I don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. I care way too much about him. We've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. He's really important to me and I'd do anything for him. That's why I hate the fraternity so much. I see the bad influences they have on him. He wants to go to medical school, and he MUST have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. He certainly has the potential and I really don't want him to fail. But, I really need to learn to let others lead their lives. I know I can't boss everyone around. I know I'm very controlling and that I've really made some bad feelings between us, but I can't help it. I get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when I think about all that stuff. I hate it when people don't listen to me (usually I end up being right too). Well, that's 00 minutes.  
__label__label0 I wonder if you are out there watching over me as I stumble through this maze called life. where on this heavenly universe do you have the  time to make sure I don't get run over by the UT buses or nearly crash as I recklessly drive home from alli's house? you must be there because you are witness to my every sin PROPNAME good deed. did you send a special angel to watch my every step and blunderous move?  that's how I feel sometimes is that everything I do is wrong or misguided and I'm always worrying about whether or not I did the right thing. but I'm so glad I have PROPNAME and PROPNAME  to help get through this social forum called college. if I could go shopping right now I'd buy every single maryjane shoe in sight. oh to have money! but I feel so guilty to have these materialistic desires that PROPNAME  does not approve of. he tells us to let go of these worldly possessions if we truly want to be a follower in his footsteps. I'm 00 for peaches sake and want stuff!!! As the father said at church during the Homily, "it's very hard to be a Christian" am I one? I was baptized and received communion but did not go on to be confirmed into the catholic church or heck even  do my first confession! that is way to weird for me. and what about finding the right man to fall in love with? what if he is so wonderful in every  way but is skeptical in Christian faith. like the guy in one of my classes I've never spoken to him but he seems sensitive and so good looking yet doesn't come across and "Christian" but appearances are always deceiving so I will hope for the best. oh my! I feel so guilty over something so  insignificant but it bothers me. I did not say good bye to josh, only  the sweetest boy in the world. he would have said bye. he even said  hello to me and remembered my name. now I know why alli is having such a hard time getting over him and that he is perfect and has a girlfriend he really loves. that's so understandable. I wonder what it would be  like to read all these confessions of the soul by psy 000 students. some people's brains I would be very scared of. I wonder what psychology boy  wrote. quiet soul. like me. I like that. I wonder if my mom is  doing good. I hope that I get to grow spiritually when I go t o church camp. yay! meet more people and make new friends. I find that hard to do I am always going out with PROPNAME. it's like she's  the only person I hang out with. but we cling to familiarity and that's okay. I met PROPNAME today and talked, well, she talked. like her. good person. geo is nice boy I wonder if he still loves PROPNAME. I wish I had somebody's heart  like that. god, when will I find him? I guess I m going to have to crawl out my shell if I want to meet the boy and leave earlier for class and sit  right next to him. I'm really tired and I think twenty minutes have passed. alright, girlie. you are going to go to sleep and dream of sweet things and cute boys who open  the door for you. thank you lord for allowing me  to get these words out of my head into the cyber-psychology  world. 
__label__label1 I have at least forty- thousand different things I have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  For one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, I have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that I haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, I feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, I went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so I go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but I forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so I had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as I said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but PROPNAME, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so I get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so I gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so I still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that I really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well I guess he can FedEx the stuff up to me  that way I'll get a package, that is really cool since I don't get any mail anymore. oh and I haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now I'm using my roommates computer which I have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  I've had a total of I think 0 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's "really good"  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well I guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and I guess they prepared me for it I guess that's why I don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead I prefer just to charge it to my parents I just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now I'm totally kidding  I have a monthly allowance now and I'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, I am enjoying college I just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school I was really involved in different organizations and I was in all AP classes so I did get stressed quite easily  I've been meeting a lot of new people of whom I love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so I'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   
__label__label1 I could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - PROPNAME's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. I could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. What used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. People are running around with bad attitudes because they are the "rebellious" ones. It is truly not they that are rebellious. They are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. True rebellion is seen in writing. In the early years of the LOCNAME LOCNAME, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. I think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. I think it was PROPNAME who was greatly criticized for his Scarlet Letter. He wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished?  She had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but I think that ORGNAME only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. The story was truly about the liberation PROPNAME PROPNAME found in her life. I don't think that is exactly what I was aiming at, but I am sure someone would understand. I like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when I compare myself to others of greater intelligence I find myself utterly an idiot. While on the subject of intelligence I would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. I do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. I feel as though there is something of importance that I could say, however seeing as I am the utter idiot, I find a rare occasion that I have anything interesting to say. I guess I would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. I would like to soak up a lot of life while I have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. I mean, sometimes I am trying so hard to enjoy life I forget that I am living it. There will never be another today. This is the only August 00, 0000 that I will ever experience. I would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent. 
__label__label1 That's what I thought, so I got very angry when earlier today they wouldn't sell me cigarettes just because my driver's license was expired. Then, they wouldn't sell them to my friend because they said that they knew that she was going to give them to me. It is ridiculous!!!  I am eighteen even if my driver's license is expired. Just because in the last two months I haven't had two hours to go and get it renewed, they're going to punish me by not letting me buy my nicotine. Some rules just make me so mad I could scream. Why would they do such stupid things?  I'm confused because I think that I'm afraid to audition for any of the plays here at LOCNAME because I'm afraid of failure, of not getting the part. My major is theatre arts and I hope to be an actress someday, and not one of those cheesy ladies on soaps. I want to be in movies and plays and be recognized and have money. I love acting and I've been doing it for so long and I never audition except for when I have to because I think maybe unconsciously, I feel less talented and afraid when they shake their heads at me. 
__label__label0 I do have spells ORGNAME concentration where I can get things accomplished, and I guess getting around to doing this assignment is one of them. I don't know what happened to me in the past couple years of my life. I grew up as a bad girl--always in the corner in elementary school, only girl in my crowd to be suspended, first girl to try "new things. "  But in the middle of my sophomore year in high school I came into contact with a few people who made me WANT to change my lifestyle. I lived in the LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME from 0th grade until the middle of my junior year. I went to a small, elite private school, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME, where I was known by teachers and parents (and everyone knew everyone in our community)as strange and, therefore bad. My attitude was "screw them" because I was angry at the world and dissatisfied with society. mind you if you really know me you find I am generally a good-natured person who looks for the best in people if they have anything to offer. And this is what my sophomore English teacher did. she was an amazing women, beyond intelligent, down to earth, somewhat of a cynic, hilarious, but very tough. a lot of students hated her at first but eventually realized she was doing it for your own good. But if you acted stupid she treated you like you were. But she treated me with respect straight off and I was slightly stunned. it sounds cheesy but she made me want to work to prove to people I had "what it takes". I was always told I had potential and I knew I did. she made me see my strong points of analyzing literature and writing and from then on I wanted to do well in school. by no means did I become a bookworm. I had fun but also made straight A's in all honor/AP classes and I realized how easily it came to me and I was content. two years later, a year and a half after I moved back to the LOCNAME, I actually got to see the recommendation she wrote for my college applications, although I wasn't supposed to. I think I cried. it was the first time someone who took me seriously enough to write and let people know that I was one of the few people who had actually touched HER life. god knows she touched mine. now I know what I have to offer even if other people don't. but lately things have become overwhelming and I feel like my hold on my life is slipping. I just hope I do decently in university. I know I can if I try but I feel no motivation. I have no energy to kick my brain in gear. and it makes me sick. but I do have hope and deep down I know I can get over it. I realize I have hit a rather shallow, false part of life and I hope my interest in learning will give me a fat kick in the rear. 
__label__label0 I'm also, I just got interrupted by a friend of mine I always seem to run into someone when I'm in the computer lab she's in my Spanish class which is nice because she always makes me laugh I wish I could type I can't so this assignment is going very slowly for me anyway back to my friend she and I used to live together my freshmen year then over the summer we both went to the same language school in LOCNAME only I didn't know she was going to be there and vice versa we saw each other in the court yard of the school one day by chance it was pretty weird to go all the way to another country just to run into your housemate I'm pretty tired and these 00 minutes aren't going by very fast I need to get home so I can watch road rules but I don't know where to catch my bus which is a little comical considering that my 00 years old I should know how to use public transportation I don't though because I usually drive but the parking situation is so bad I would have to wake up at the crack of dawn to find a parking place even then it would probably take an act of God oh well I don't have to worry about that today I only need worry about finding my bus I think it's in front of jester I have a lot of classes in jester this semester which I don't like I hate that place it reminders me of my freshmen year not that I lived there it's just that it's such a freshmen place and it smells bad like a day care center ok I would like to apologize for that low blow I was a freshmen too once speaking of freshmen why given the parking problem are they allowed to have cars on campus that pisses me off 
__label__label0 I haven't been in the mood to do any homework. I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from LOCNAME LOCNAME. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends ORGNAME. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in LOCNAME. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to LOCNAME because I didn't want to go to ORGNAME because my brother went there. UT and ORGNAME were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, PROPNAME, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. PROPNAME goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. PROPNAME is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and PROPNAME. PROPNAME I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and PROPNAME are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes PROPNAME's side. My reasoning was because I thought PROPNAME was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say. Don't think I'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but I just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. Which leaves me very lonely. It's mainly my fault because I don't want to spend much time with PROPNAME because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. PROPNAME, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except I don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) PROPNAME, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. And PROPNAME, who called me yesterday just to talk. Now how nice is that?  I mean, I went to PROPNAME's today before class, and I had fun. She's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. )  Which I guess why I used to have bad feelings towards her. She's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but I kind of want to meet my own friends. I group of new friends. Also, PROPNAME the homesick one made friends too. Which is good, because she needs to be happy. However, I think it is about time for me to make some friends. Well, also I tried out for the ballet class here. It sucks!  I'm so mad. There are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. I was stuck in the freshmen class. It is so bad. I've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. Not to mention there is no pointe here!  I am not trying to sound smug, because I was far from being the best at my studio at home. But these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. Don't get me wrong, I was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to "place our arm on the barre"  I almost died. I know where to put it. I don't need help with that. I need help with my turnout, extension, balance!  NOT WITH WERE TO PUT MY ARM ON THE BARRE!  Well, as you can see I am not excactly a happy camper. I'm glad I wrote this, it was fun. My fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but I'm sure I need to get used to that. Well, I'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. It's PROPNAME and the PROPNAME. We've done it before. It's going to be cute. I was the Duck, my friend PROPNAME(who goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME) was the Bird. She was a great dancer. She was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the Nutcracker(not PROPNAME, but the ORGNAME ORGNAME)  she shared it with PROPNAME who dance the Cat. PROPNAME is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. She was going to go to LOCNAME on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. My other good friend is PROPNAME, she's a sophomore. She is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. So those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. I love ballet, we also have this one dancer named PROPNAME, she has extension to die for. That means her leg goes all the way to her ear. She is great. I love ballet, that makes me so happy. Well, thanks for this assignment, I'll see you in class, but I doubt you'll see me!  I'll probably drop by you office sometime!  I hope this makes since! 
__label__label1 and I feel like I'm starting to get sick, and I really feel like going home for a while and forget about everything involved with college and responsibility. oh well I'm also really sick of guys and everything that they bring about in my life. not really but they seem to confuse me a lot, especially when the one I really love is way too old for me, but he is my best friend. I can't even sleep anymore because I have so much on my mind, everything that was familiar to me in my life has been dramatically changed in a period of a couple of weeks. I miss my family not like homesick but just miss being a part of my family circle. I don't feel like I truly belong anywhere anymore. when I go home all my stuff is here and I feel like I'm missing something important in my life when I'm away from home. I am really worried about money, I have a car payment due in about a week and I feel bad taking money from my parents constantly. I am still working some in LOCNAME LOCNAME but it gets hard to go back and forth every other weekend. but I'm worried about not working at all because I need money now more than ever. the real reason I don't want to quit working there is because my boss is like my best friend who I am madly in love with and who I have been in love with for the last 0 years. I miss him so much and if I don't work there anymore I'm afraid I won't get to see him anymore. that would be one of the worst things that could happen he makes me laugh I get mad at him but I get mad at him because I do love him. oh well obviously he is in my mind more than just about anything. I forget about him occasionally when I go out with my friends or other guys, but the minute I think I have forgotten about him. he calls. he called me 0 times this weekend, and it makes me wonder what is he thinking does he miss me as much as I miss him if I'm lucky the answer is yes, but he may just think of me as a really good friend. and maybe that is all we are meant to be I just want to get out in the open even though I'm sure he all ready knows. but I'm young I should only be thinking about school but that can be easier said than done 00 years. of my life was spent in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I miss everything I left behind even though I am enjoying things here too I mean it is all a new experience and I like not having to really answer to anybody but myself and God. even though I completely respect my parents it was time for me to grow up and lead my own life and make all my own decisions. that is all.    
__label__label1 Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. PROPNAME, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 00 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy "Titanic. "  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her "No. "  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will "turn into" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     
__label__label0 my mom should be here in about 00 min are we going out to eat or will I have to wait till we get home. who will get the front seat in her car?  I wonder what will be going on in temple when we get back should I go to the football game or hang out with PROPNAME and his friends. it will be our anniversary tomorrow so I should do something with him tomorrow and go to the game tonight. my poor puppy. I really miss him I hope he doesn't shrivel up and die like my mom said sometimes to pets when their owners go away to college. he's been staying under my bed even at dinner. this must be serious. I wonder if PROPNAME and I will stay together. I know that every time a big transition in our lives has occurred, like school starting, things have always been kind of weird. now I guess it's just the same thing. we have a lot of fun one day and then the next thing are weird. I guess that it  is just us adjusting. I can't believe that PROPNAME talked about all of the guys who have stalked her for 00 min this morning in the loudest voice possible. now the whole house knows how desirable she is. this song is annoying but if I get up and change it I won't be able to get back on my writing track. it's over now. she even brought up that guy who threw her in the trash can when she rejected him. she told us that that was back in sixth grade. I guess she is just feeling insecure and needs to tell people that others really do like her. she needs to work on her social skills. I feel sorry for PROPNAME. she on the other hand seems to be doing great. I guess she bonded with the other girls during the smoke breaks. it kind of sucks that things that I don't want to do , like smoke or drink keeps me from getting closer to the other girls in the house. after all it is only the second week and I'm sure things will change. I haven't really met that many new people that I want to develop friendships with but strangely I don't even care. I like being by myself more than I used to. I guess that is normal, maybe even a defense mechanism. my mom should be here in half an hour now. I don't even really miss anything about home, except for my dog of course,  probably because I distanced myself from it enough that I was even disgusted with the town in the last week. that helped. I'm glad that I can analyze my own feelings and realize why I'm having them. it helps sort things out and helps me realize that I am having normal reactions to a big transition. I hope that misty is doing alright. I can't believe that PROPNAME said that about her. she is so inconsiderate and self centered. she wants to hang out on Saturday but I really have no desire to see her. she has become somewhat of a slut in my opinion. twenty minutes is up it was nice talking to you Mr. computer. you should be a therapist 
__label__label1 It is hard to put thoughts and feelings into words. The air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. My stomach has felt bad all day, I took Pepto Bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. I'm tired, and it's only 00:00. This house is always so messy, I wish PROPNAME would help me keep it clean. I'm going to start doing better. The picture of Deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. What am I going to wear tomorrow?  I don't want to have to wake up early. I have to wake up at 0, I guess that isn't that early. I had so much fun at my family reunion. I miss my family even though I just saw them 0 days ago. Some woman on the TV was trying to kill her kid, PROPNAME PROPNAME wanted to kill her daughter?  The news is so horrible. It's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. I think more people should be executed. The government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. If someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. I can't wait until Christmas. I already know what I'm going to get PROPNAME and my mom, and my dad. We're going to get my dad a 00 K modem. He's wanted one for a long time. What a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. OH well. I don't want to type for 00 more minutes. I think this assignment is stupid. I don't see the point. Or maybe there is  a point, but I'm not helping because I'm doing it wrong. What does it matter, is anyone really going to read this?  I feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. Oh good, I didn't want PROPNAME to come over and read this, he left the living room. Our apartment is pretty smalll but I resally like living in austin. Finally, he's going to take out the trash. Only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. Oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 00 years for molesting a child. What makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. I think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. They are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. I think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. I hate democrats. I hate PROPNAME PROPNAME. I will be so glad when he is no longer our president. I hope PROPNAME runs next year, I know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 0 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 0:00. So should I go to the trig review class or should I go to church?  I think I'll end up leaving early from class so I can make it to church. I need to get my priorities straight. It's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. I want to save peolpe from going to Hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. Now I'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like I"m some crazy conservative person. Narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. The bible says loud and clear that more people will go to Hell than Heaven.

__label__label1 I am glad that I am finally getting to this assignment!  I have had so much homework, and just can't seem to stay on top of things. "I'll have the weekend," I continue to say to myself, but I know I'll just want to watch television or hang out instead. I went to the meeting of the tennis club today, and am very excited about that, even if I have to ride the bus to the courts whenever I want to play. I went running this morning, but just feel so out of shape. I know I'll never be super skinny, my body just isn't built like that!  I'm looking forward to playing again. I'm even willing to brave the tournaments, or at least look cool wearing a new t-shirt showing off my participation. I'm sill hoping to meet some people who I can actually hang out with, go out with, stuff like that. I meet many people, but none of them seem to be willing to get to know the real you. They all have friends here from school, yeah, like anyone else from LOCNAME is crazy enough to come here. I also want to play the piano some while I am here. I don't have my books, so I'll have to recover them when I go home in October. I am excited about that, it will be so neat to "fly home" for the weekend!  Hopefully I'll make it up to LOCNAME and LOCNAME to see some people. I've been thinking a lot about PROPNAME lately, and would love to be able to connect with her through seeing PROPNAME'ja and preserving her memory. Too bad he is never home when I call. While I am doing this, I realize I need to do the pre-test, I just can't seem to find an hour!  The weeks are already flying by, and the panic of upcoming tests is setting in. "Oh no, only a week and a half until the first Psych test!"  I'm caught up in reading, re-typing notes, now all I need to do is read them over. I'm so tired right now, all that is left on the agenda for tonight is German, and reading Chapter 0 of Astronomy. It will be nice to actually do problems for once, instead of living my life reading and taking notes. I can't wait until I am confindent in my self-image, if that ever occurs. I just don't have the will power to work out like a crazy woman!  Tennis. just keep thinking. tennis. I really do love tennis, and its number one male star PROPNAME PROPNAME. Too bad he is injured, the US Open just isn't the same!  Maybe my new tennis partners will become my new buddies!  Speaking of tennis, another thing to add to my list is to check on Match Mates. Wow, twenty minutes can be a long time when the assignment is to ramble on about yourself. PROPNAME has to go to the mall this weekend, so I'm going to go with her. RUE 00 and Forever 00, I need to buy myself a new outfit. It will be quite the experience catching the bus to get there though. Just like making it to the tennis courts, I'm a pro at the campus look today. I hope the woman who feel outside Jester is ok, that would be so scary!  I need to go to bed, and tomorrow is my super long day. The SI sessions are going to be a big help, but they are just such a pain to attend. An extra three hours a day is enough to make me crazy. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME meets tomorrow, so that will be fun. Also, Party on the Plaza is tomorrow night, a fun function. I hope I didn't miss Austin Powers playing on the south mall. I didn't get very much e-mail today, that makes for a depressing day. I did, however, get my high school yearbook. I loved how I pimped that school, I miss the friendships. I miss tennis season. Most college students say they don't want to go back to high school, but at this point I wouldn't mind. I'd have to say I loved not doing homework. Ooh, our sing just sounded like it was about to die. I love the internet, it is so convienient typing this paper to submit via the information super highway!  I am completely addicted to my computer, and I'd die without it. I type everything, e-mail everyone, it is truly my life! Well, my 00 minutes are up. 
__label__label1 okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 0-0:00 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :0:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute

__label__label0 I really miss all of my people back home. I really miss kim I wish she would take me back. I miss having her around to hold me and make me feel happy. I really really miss being happy. I can't seem to do it on a regular basis without her. why did she break up with me. I still realy don't understand. I was very good to her. lacey said I was her favorite out of all of kims boyfriends. seems like that says something. but I guess not. were still broken up and I don't see that changing any time soon. excpet I wonder what that big long letter was going to be about. I find that very interesting. could she have written about how much she misses me and wants me back. who knows, hell, I may never know and thats the problem. I really want to know. I want her to be honest with me about everything that goes through her mind about me. I would love if she would just write down every thought she ever has about me and just tell me. that would make things so much easier for me. it may hurt sometimes, but at least I would know. that would make me feel a lot better. I really hope she writes me back to tell me what that letter said. it bothers me that I can't know. I wish she wouldnt have even told me that she had written that damn thing. now its going to be on my mind all the time. at least until she tells me what it said or at least what it was about. thats all I want to know. I want to know if it said she wanted to get me back, or if she never wanted to talk to me again. I think she still wants to talk to me cause I know she cares about me. lacey told me that, and I know that. but I just want to know what it said. and I want to know what PROPNAME was talking about when she said that brad and john said they were talking about how I stalked kim. when could I have done that??  I was out of town, so its pretty impossible that I could have stalked someone 000 miles away. I wonder if kim thinks that I stalk her. I don't know how she could think that. its really silly to think that someone would think that. but kathryn said that brad may have told her that just to make her happy. why would it make kathryn happy that I stalk kim, even though I don't. I guess cause now kathryn knows that someone hurt me as bad as I hurt them. oh well, forget that idea. kathryn and I are friends now so it shouldnt matter that I got hurt by kim. it should make kathryn sad when I am sad. I know it does cause she told me when she called me to see how I'm doing. so I know that brad was lying now. kim never thought I was stalking her. if she did why would she still talk to me. I just wish that when she talks to me she would say that she wants me back. just like in that damn song. "when I go fishing for the words I am wishing you would say to me I'm really only praying that the words youll soon be saying might betray the way you feel about me" yeah thats how it is for me. since I think she doesn't want me back yet. it would be such a good thing if she did. even though I would see her about once a month and we are 000 miles apart. oh well. cest la vie. I could deal with that just to know that she is committed to me. thats all I really want from her. I just want to know that she is committed to me. this sucks royal ass that shes probably out running around with hundereds of guys, and I'm here being miserable. if I ever found out that she was I would just go crazy. I wouldnt be able to deal with that at all. that would push me over the edge, like I'm not close enough already. even now that I'm here all I do is think about her. I've thought about her too much. I should be trying to find someone here that I can be like that with bt I really can't. I wouldnt mind meeting that vollyball player that alex was telling me about. she sounds really cool. if it was her that I saw today with that coach then shes really hot. and shes a christian too, so that would help me if she was. plus she lives a lot closer than kim or wendy or julie or erica. that would make things so much easier on me. I would really like to fall for this girl. then I could get my mind off of kim. if she doesn't come back to me, then I need to get my mind off her. but its too hard. I loved her too much. I still do. thats what sucks so much. but what can I do. not a thing in the world. I can love her all I want but if she doesn't love me then its all worthless. that bothers me to death. this is my first day of class and all I can think about is her. I liked my classes today. I have homework in every one of them. I should be thinking about that, but I'm still thinking about her. thank god my time is almost up on this thing. my wrists are getting tired. and my fingers too. this is really ridiculous. but I do see the point in it though. times up. bye 
__label__label0 Right now I am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. I really wish that I had worked on this assignment earlier. I am now starting to worry because I have to finish Calculus homework and read a few pages for Engineering. And I have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. It is bugging me that I left that one problem unfinished. It is also bugging me that I left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. I never thought about that before, but I do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. Weird. I just had an epiphany. It is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. Whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. Like a word you've never heard before. Take before. Before Before Before Before Before Before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. That is really odd. And it works with every word, too. Hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. Not thinking of much anymore. I used to think of how much I missed home. now it is not so prominent. I don't think of PROPNAME as much. I still do sometimes. But it comes and goes. I am not going to let myself get trapped like I have before. It is just a vicious cycle. I feel much better this time. I have somehow learned to overcome sadness. I dunno exactly how it happened, but I have learned to overcome and bypass it. It doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. Now that I think about it, I am really starting to wonder how I managed to do that. Inherently, I think that I can get fixated easily;  that right there is a sign that I am bound to get hurt one of these days. And I have. but I have learned. The question is, how?  Hmm. oh well. No matter now. As long as I can do it. That is good enough for me. Maybe its the college atmosphere. Being alone and on my own. In a sense, anyway. I look around my room and realize that I do not miss home. I don't know why. I missa family and friends at time, but I don't MISS them. Its weird. Maybe its because I don't consider myself away from them. PROPNAME said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. Hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on Labor Day. Maybe I need to stay away from home longer. Hmm. that must be it. PROPNAME got me thinking about PROPNAME again. Hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. It can't be too hard;  lots of people have already met people. I jsut need to go and try. PROPNAME knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. Comes natural to him though. I honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. I feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. I am liking the way I am handling things, liking the way I have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that I can make my own decisions. I am starting to feel better and better about college life. It is great. Except for all the people. There is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. A sort of fakeness. Many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. People don't act the way I am used to seeing them act in high school. Maybe that is it. Asians don't act like Asians at home, for one thing. Most other people act the same, but the Asians here don't. A little different. a little meaner?  That can't be it though, I really need to meet more and judge. Ugh. i feel like I've just cursed myself for saying that. I really didn't mean that. I am being too cynical I guess. But you can't win them all. I am happy otherwise;  I have met a few good friends, I like the campus, and I am close to home. I feel connected in all aspects. LOCNAME was probably one of the best choices I ever made. My Dad thinks so. he told me the other night. I always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. He usually is, I've learned. Almost always. I need to learn to respect that. I'm the one who's usually wrong. Oh well. Better late than never. Time for Calculus. 
__label__label0 In Phl 000 we've been talking about PROPNAME and Deintology, which leads me to a question:why am a writing this; is schoolwork a hypothetical or categorical imparitive? Do I really care what the about the answer to that question? No. I'm just picking my brain. Frustration is undoubtedly a major hinderance to my well being. Why didn't the tab button work when I pressed it? Heplessness is abundant in my brain when it comes to computers. Thinking of the word helpless reminds me of that CSN&Y song. They're such a great group- but not as great as LOCNAME LOCNAME- their predecessor. Whatever. That's the word that runs through my head most often these days. I really wonder whether it matters what I write in this assignment. Who in this beauracracy of a ORGNAME is actually going to read this? I doubt much if it would matter if I just wrote something like "I enjoy carrots" over and over again. Whatever. There's that word again. Every time that you ask for more, its the sound that makes the colors go blind, and everything comes in three's, but your face shows 0-lost in a watershed-way out of tune. Got that? I doubt it, in fact I doubt you made it this far. Lack of patience most likely. Patience is a very admirable quality. I wish I had more of it. In fact, ever since I arrived here my patience has been raped, but I'll get more into that in writing assignment #0. believe it or not, its been 00 minutes, and though this "stream of consciousness" seems to be more about this assignment than anything else, I am just articulating what is on my mind. I guess that doesn't really matter if this isn't being graded. Since I know no one will read this I may as well confess that my dog, PROPNAME and my friend PROPNAME spend most nights defecating on all the wombats in the toilet, but that doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is that PROPNAME also likes to slap a alligators to death with a certain part of his anatomy. This really seems to impress Iranian supermodels. Go figure. 
__label__label1 I wonder what my mother is doing right now. I hope that she is taking the news of the weekend plans well. If I hadn't told I think I would have felt guilty. Yeah guilty. PROPNAME sure is excited about it so screw what she thinks I am going to be happy and if she gets mad at that than to bad for her. My father thinks it's okay. I mis my father I miss my bed I miss my ORGNAME and my dog My dog that is one great dog I can;t wait for the weekend. Showering with shoes is getting old and I have only done it for a week and I am ready to take a shower with out shoes. Grandma food can't wiat to get grandma food. That is the best food the world has ever seen grandma food. I wish I could grandma food instead of cafe foood everyday. I really don't like my math professor I can;t understand a word he says serves me right not going to that web site and reading those teachers evaluation forms. PROPNAMEs back and I don't where she been. I hope she had a great time. It is nice that she lets me us her computer I am tired of dealing wiht my internet service 00 minutes is a long time to type I am so tired of my internet service how in the world are we suppose to do it that stupid ethernet card I am about to throw it up against the wall I can't' wait to see my boyfriend I wonder what he is doing right now Its only been 00 minutes and my hands are really getting tired of typing My boyfriend what a great guy I hope that he is okay I'm sure that he is. He is the best. PROPNAME what it si that he got me he said he got me something I love surprises I wish I got surprises everyday that would make life great great this is great some music would be nice my favorits cd I haven't listened to it in a while and I really like it I wonder ay I haven't listen to it. I hope that PROPNAME gto her paper done Man I need sleep I am so tired I think that I am going to get some disease if I don't get more sleep than I have been I have a sharp pain in my wriast from typing that's odd I wonder why that is It's been 00 minutes and it seems like forever "Who will save our soul"  Jewel I really like jewel I really need to take a shower oh well I'll take one tomorrow I always have to think is tomorrow spelt with two r's or two m's. I can't ever get that right. PROPNAME is cleaning I wonder if she will notice that I am writing about her she is great I like all of the people that I have met and my mother didn't think that I would make any friends. SHe was so wrong I think that 00 minutes is way to long my brain actually feels tired I wonder why that is It's probably because I wonder about too many things too many things I can't wait for Halloween maybe I'll go to a costume party that would be fun I havn't gone to one of those in a while I'm sure that there will be one some where around campus I love PROPNAME Carol has a chikfila cow I think that's great I think maybe I should have bought one of those as well. I wish I had but than again I am a college student and like all other college students I have no money. No money I wish I had money it would make life so much easier or would maybe not maybe so that's a good question to ask myself money probably would make me lazy which would make me fat Yuck>  I am so excited about this weekend it makes me so happy to think about showering without shoes on and real food and all of the animals at Sea WOrld Its been a long time since I went to sea World to see all of the shows. This ime I am going to watch the shows so PROPNAME can see them and that is PROPNAME's favorite part the shows I always upset her beacuse I hate the shows this time she will be happy. 
__label__label0 Well I have to say I'm alittle nervous about this assignment. Writing for twenty minutes continously will be a challenge sine I don't think I can even sit in the say seat for twenty min. but anyways. PROPNAME I hope this is sufficient, and I'm sorry that you have to look over all of these. THat's quite a task. I'm in the computer lab and there is a guy using a typewriter . I think that's kind of odd. but whatever. THen there is a girl next to me who could probably type 0000 words a minute and I'm over here using my index fingers. Anyway I don't really know where to begin Maybe I'll talk about the use this exersze would be to a psychologist. I bet you can tell a lot form one of these. People are probably honest and least once they get going. And honesty is hard to find these days. We are all actors on the stage of life. "  I take this to mean, to our outside world we put on plays. We are afraid of truely being ourselves {whatever that means} and we end up conforming into a type of behavior that is acceptable to our society. I know If everyone followed this belief, then we would all be the same. But good thing about it, is we all have different wviews of what society is,  And we have diiferent feelings toward that society. Such as rebellion, isolation, acceptance, contentiveness, that's not a word is it. but you know what I mean. I do know this isn't crazy the way things work, how well basically the same but we can be so different. It's very humbling to me. To be just another face in the crowd but there is so much there twhen you look at it. Sometimes I like to look at life{my reality} as a fractal. If you don't know a fractal is geometric chaos. It has an infinite amount of surface area, so If you look at one point, it turns into another point, and so on and so on. THat's what I think the human brain is like. You have human race as a species, then country, then state, then county, then town, then extended family, then nuclear family, then the mind itself, and in comparison to the rest of theat one hasn;t gone anywhere. THere is so much learn.  
__label__label1 I don't know why I got to do this assignment. I am feeling kinda hungry now. I wish iwere in dallas now with my friends . I like the shoes that guy is wearing. I need to call up my friend today. mann this assignment is boring. hope the professor does'nt fail me for reading this. I wonder what's for lunch today. I wish time would pass by fast and friday would come soon. Some people in the library look really old. I wish I were tall like the guy walking there. I think my watch is faster than the watch here. I need fill out a petition form for credit like the person beside me after I get done with this assignment. is drinking really necessary to be cool. I have thirteen minutes remaining. I wish my girlfriend were here. I think I should find another girlfriend. umm maybe not I donno I'm confused. why is that guy there staring this way ? what am I supposed to do today ? math is done I guess I'll finish economics once I'm done with this pointless assignment. Nine minutes left and I hate typing cause I am not fast like other pepole but's it's okay I guess. how do pepole study soo much ? I should try out the bus service here sometime. i got 0 minutes left and my mind isnow thinking of what to think . is'nt that confusing. it is soo quiet in here. I am bored but I got to finish this assignment. that girl looks finee , ooh well I should not be distracted or cheat on my girlfriend. mann there are many indian students in this university, never seen soo many indian students ever. should I juss submit it although I have 0 mins left  I guess I'll just sit till 0 mins pass by ooh well a in left and I got to finish the petition form .

__label__label0 There is a girl named amy who annoys me very much. We used to be very good friends until I found her true personality. PROPNAME;s personality is hard to relate to which makes her hard to get along with. She only does things that help her or make her look better. For example, she will only become friends with people who benifit her or make her look cool. PROPNAME requires shopping. She shops at least once a week. Her shopping habbits drive me insane. PROPNAME cares so much about how she appears to other that it hides her true personality. She acts like the person she wants to be but will never become. PROPNAME is a smart girl but that is not obvious in a conversation. She acts oblivious to the current events and common knowledge.  Being at college and having a girlfriend at home is a hard task to handle. Eventhough it is tough to do, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is. While I do not see my girlfriend half as much as I am used to, I can still call her everyday. While phone conversations are not physicall confromtations, they do help in easing the pain of not having her around all the time. By being apart for extended periods of time, when I do end up going home to visit, the benefits are rewarding. The time spent together then is more special than any other time I have spent with her before. Because we both know our time is limited, we seem closer during my home visits. It is some of the only times when we think on the same level. Both of our plans include us spending time together. Eventhough I would much rather be at home with her, I am glad we made the choice to stay together while I am at college. Next year I can only hope that she decides to attend UT. It would ease a difficult stage in our relationship. 
__label__label1 I am so happy to be home right now. College life is fun and all, but I miss the comforts of home. At the dorm, there is always something "extremely important" to do at every moment. Someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. I have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. I am getting so overwhelmed by it all. I suddenly have so many responsibilities. Like making sure I wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure I eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. And my current boy situation is so overwhelming. Suddenly, no that I am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. They are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. It is so weird to not have a boyfriend since PROPNAME and I were together for 00 months. To make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. Our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. I know that lots of girls feel the need to "find themselves" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before I actually was in their shoes. I mean, don't you know who you are? I thought that I did, but now that everything is so different, I feel very lost and confused about who I am and what types of values/morals I have. Up to this point, every decision I made was affected to some degree by my parents. For example, my 0 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where I went at night, how much sleep I got each night. Also, there were rules on who I went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. Now, I can come and go as I please with no questions asked. I'm not so sure that is a good thing. I mean, just because I am 00, that does not mean I suddenly competent to run my entire life. I miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. Although, I think that mom and I talk more now than when I lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. We talk almost five times a day. But it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when I am down. What is also so diffucult now is that when I need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. So, I am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that I have formed some sort of bond with. Friendships are difficult and delicat things. I know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. They take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. You cannot just jump in and say "Oh we are best friends now. " That is why soroity life is so strange now. I have been thrown into this new "family" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet I don't even know most of their names. I guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. However, I am thankful to have somewhere to go when I get lonely. Which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone. 
__label__label1 the tv in here is always too loud. I know I shouldnt watch it while I study but its kind of hard with people in and out all the time anyway. and the fan is always too cold. but thats ok because I just ran all the way over here since I thought that I had missed the deadline for this. that really scared me. I have been slacking off way more than  I should. I hate the way on awards shows try to kick people off stage subtley with light music or commercials. its just kind of rude. I don't know why they make such a big deal about the emmys anyway. tv is not good. rots the brain. I think computers do it much more. I always have headaches after staring at a screen for a while. my head hurts already. I am so glad this is going to be in on time. and I'm missing a bit of study hall anyway and that is good. I love kevin costner. too bad hes getting a little old. and he did that movie post man. this week is going to be harder than the  first two. I think. I need to go to those si sessions. my shoulders itch and I really need to figure out what I'm going to do this weekend. I need to just make a decision and stick to it for once. I really need a haircut this week. I am a little on the shaggy side. there are certain things that I do miss about home now that I'm actually gone. I'm not the type to get homesick but I at least knew my way around for simple things like haircuts. and I had options. here I am pretty much stuck with whatever is closest. this assignment is going on forever. I think I was a little worried that it was late. so I got a little excited when it came to typing. thank god lindsey was wrong. I love the show friends. but I quit falling for all those reatarded teen shows. can't stand them. hopefully I can fill up the space before I run out of time. or things to say. atleast my computer is finally working. I fell dumb that I couldnt set it up myself. I'm better off than my roommate though. she had never sent an email before saturday. pretty lame if you ask me. crap I forgot to call that guy about the football tickets. I would be so excited if I got to go to dallas on friday. I miss those people. not the alchoholism though. this better not delete or crash right now. would be too typical . not really. this is like writing a big letter or email. but this is a lot more boring because instead of actually talking to a person who has any idea of who I am or what I'm like  I'm just talking to myself. I'm actually talking to a computer screen which is even sadder. but no one is going to be reading this so I guess it doesn't matter. as long as  I turn this in. I'm so bored right now and all I can think about is that I have to do another one. not good. blah blah blah. I think I'm done. 
__label__label1 Twenty minutes. Write until about 00:00. I wish the colors in the ORGNAME were not so ugly. I like these shoes but I wish my socks were shorter though. I need to get a bed in my apartment. The floor is real itchy. I don't know where to put it though. I like the desk where it is and I don't want to put the bed there but if IO put it in the corner it will block the door to the closet. Even though there is another doo I still need both of them because it woiuld make things so much easier. I wonder what we'll do in basketball today. PROPNAME is giving me some keys but I don't know what they go to. Fifteen minutes left. Its fuuny how much you write and how fast time goes by when you don't have anything real to write about. I wish they'd let me watch how practice works for a few days and then I can start helping. I hope I don't mess up to much on the court especially since PROPNAME was so adament about me being out there because I played in high school. Only ten more minutes. Wow. I need to get a shower curtian. I'm tired of having to be real careful when I take a shower and not splash water everywhere. I wonder how much I will get paid a month. I hope its good. my hand is getting tired from writing so much and not stopping. I think I'll catch the bus up to my apartment, get thtat web address come to the SMF, type this, go back to the ORGNAME, study kinese, and go meet PROPNAME. Maybe I'll eat some lunch at the apartment to. Halfway done. I wonder what bus takes me to LOCNAME. It would be easier than walking. i bett0er learn the ropes cause next year I'll be in charge. i wish I couldbe on the boys team but not with so many other managers. There will be somne pretty tough spots, me bieng a guy and them bieng girls. sports bras?  Bout 0 minutes left. I think me and coach conradt will get along p[retty good. I the organiozed, on top of it, one step ahead of you, I already did it sort of guy. At least I was in high school. I wonder if we'll get individual pics taken. I'd like to send one to Coach PROPNAME. i bet he'd put it up on the wall next to adrian and pat. That would be very cool. I feel sorry for PROPNAME with his shopulder and all. I wonder if he'll play in college. He was on of the best players I've everseen come thru elgin but I havent been around that liong. I like this school. you can lay down opn the grass and take a nap and noone will mwess with you. theres too amy people here to bother any one, too many different lifestyles. 00 minutes? On the dot. Time to go. 
__label__label1 As I sit here at my computer, I can't help but think about everything going on in my life right now. This year has been an incredible time in my life. My senior year in highschool, I was involved in many extracurricular activities. I was one of the head dance team captains, I was the Student Counsil spirit committee chairperson, and I was involved in Key club. I felt I had everything going for me. I had gotten into UT with my best friend. We couldn't believe both of us got in. I remember my best friend got in first and I didn't think I had gotten in. Every time I checked online it said I was still in review. A week later she calls me and says she has some good news. The first thing she said was,"so what color bed spread do you want to get. "  I knew right away what she was saying. I was so excited. After that there was no more pressure as to if I had gotten in or not. The pressure now was the fact that in a few months I was going to have to live on my own. It was weird because it would never hit me that I was really going to be in college. Even a week before I was going to leave I still couldn't tell myself I was leaving. The day I got up here was really hot and tiring. Moving stuff up and down the elevators from the parking garage to the dorm, then from the dorm up to my room. The halls were very hot and crowded. We had to wait in a line to even get into the elevator. Once I got all my stuff into my room I now had to unpack it all and organize it all. I remember feeling so disorganized. When I feel disorganized I begin to get upset. Well my parents were being very helpful and understanding. There was a point when I just wanted to cry. After an hour or two my parents left and it was just me and my best friend in our room. I had to move stuff around almost 0 times before I was happy, but even then I did not feel satisfied. Atleast right now I think I can say I am happy about my room. That is after a few shopping trips. This morning was the big football game against ORGNAME. We had tickets to go but it was just too hot. All I have to do though is look out my window and I can see the whole stadium full of screaming fans. I do have to say I have a wonderful view. While sitting here in my room after a week or two of classes gone by, I feel I am more comfortable. I feel a sense of pride, a sense of independance, and all in all I am now very happy. I have met many intersting people, I love all my classes, and most of all I love UT. The funny thing is that it has finally hit me that I am now in college. Being the oldest in the family made it a little harder leaving, but all my life I have been the one to do everything first. My parents are very proud of me and I can say that I am very proud of myself. 
__label__label0 The first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. They are ages 0 and 0. I can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. They live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. I feel bad saying this, but it is true. She is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. When I used to live with her I took advantage of this. I made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and I did not take care of myself. Thank God I got out of that situation. I moved in with my father and my former stepmother. They got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them I would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. Even after my dad and stepmom got divorced I still lived with her, I am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. Getting back to my sisters, I am afraid that they will fall into the same habits I did and they are not as lucky as I was to have my stepmom. I can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. I hope that I can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because I only get to see them about once a month. They are beautiful children with great personalities. Unfortunately PROPNAME the 0 year old has already had troubles in school. I know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. Andrea the 0 year old is absolutely brilliant, I don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern I did of lying and not doing her school work. I would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because I am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. I cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. I know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and I love my mother very much also, but I just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. It would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. Overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that. 
__label__label1 As I sat here reading the assignment, half of me read the words while the other half of me sat concentrating on my sweaty palms that I only seconds ago was rubbing. My stomach is apparently telling me that I am hungry in its own noisy language. I just went to a 00th anniversary party for my grandparents last night. I got up to speak with the other grandkids. My cousin PROPNAME, who lost her mother (my aunt) about 00 years ago spoke before me about how incredibly remarkable they have been acting as her parental role models, support system, and financial suppliers. By the time the michrophone ( I do not know how to spell "mike" [I guess]) got to me. . well- I didn't get to speak. I woke up this morning thinking about what I wanted to say, and I decided that whenI finish this assignment, I will write them a note to write them what my tears prevented me from saying. That reminds me of another letter I need to write- a totally belated graduation present thank you letter. I don't feel like a complete jerk- I received the gift pretty late. I just took notice of my blistered feet. They took some serious heat from rush. My sister and I are now in the same sorority. Hopefully, that can be a tie that binds. We get along so well- when we're apart. It's kind of a shame that we lived together for so long (sometimes sharing a room) because we probably could have been the best of friends. 
__label__label0 I wonder what I am doing right now, this is a little annoying, stupid grammer mistakes are irritating me. Hmmm, I hope that PROPNAME likes the present that I have for her. How am I going to get back, and how am I going to get back? How much will it cost, how will I do on my psychology test I have the coming monday. I hope that I will still have time to study. Oh well, I'm tired I really wish I didn't have to do this right now. Hehehe, I wonder if that guy I just e-mailed will reply to me anytime soon, and I wonder if he'll actually have what I want. How much will the new motherboard I need cost? Can I wait 0 months? I hate waiting, oh well. I wonder if PROPNAME is asleep right now, I really do miss her. Atleast I'll get to see her when I go back for her birthday next week. This is really going to take a long time to do, the writing assignment I'm doing right now. Havnt' played pool in a while, I hope that I'm still decent. What's on the TV right now and why am I paying so much attention to the way that I'm typing right now, I keep going back and making corrections to my mistakes when it already said I shouldn't. Bad habit I guess, always want everything to be perfect. Dumb Browser, messing up. Annoying sound. I hope that when I go to Block-buster tomorrow they will Final Fantasy VIII. I wonder if it will be as good as it's supposed to be. I hope that I do good in college, get goood grades and do well in general, though I also hope that I have fun also. It's a bit anoyying having to think and type so fast at the same time oh well. I have to do it for my assignment. The TV is really loud and annoying right now, unfortunately my roommate is watching it right now and I'm doing thing right now so I can't stop and turn it down or anything. I like my roommate pretty much we get a long pretty well, but anyways why am I thinking ORGNAME this, never knew that my mind switched from thoughts so suddenly. I wonder if I have attention defecit disorder. I hope now, that would be really bad, though that might explain why I never really did as well as my brother or sister in school. I wonder what they are doing now. I wonder if they've ever drunk alcohol. Anyways, that's none of my bussiness. Hmmmmm. I wish I didn't have to go to school tomorrow, wish I could just stay home and just rest and enjoy myself. I sill need to do my calculus, philosophy, and psychology. The other part of it atleast. It's a little difficult right now with all these distractions, but I guess I'll cope. Hmm. don't really know what to think about or write about right now. Hmm I wonder how much my plane ticket will cost when I buy it, I hope it doesn't cost too much. But it's for her, so I guess it's worth it. Wish I could see her right now. I rememver the first time I saw her, it was a little strange and I didn't know her name. hehehe. she was cute, nice to look at and she was nice  too. anyways I'd better stop thinking about her and get my mind on some work. Another thing I wonder how I'm going to pay for my plane ticket I still havn't recieved my bank card or checking card from ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Annoying. Hmmm. Those funyons look good right now, I wonder if I should stop right now and eat some food. I wonder if the milk is still good, or if it's bad now. I'm in the mood for some cereal right now, kinda wierd. But I've always been a little wierd. Anyways this is getting rediculous and a bit tedious also on my fingers. getting tired from just looking at the screen right now and typing. oh well. how much longer is it, oh  0 minutes. I guess that's not too bad. Hmmm. I want to stop. anoyying. oh well. aonly a little longer. I'm starting to get careless. but anyways. I wish PROPNAME would stop messaging me right now I'm trying to do this but I can't with him messageing me. TV is getting louder right now, must be some horror movie or something. too bad I can't turn around to look right now and type the same cause it would be a little difficult to do so right now while typing and having to occasionally look at the keyboard to make sure I don't mess up. I wonder if my fingers look wierd right now moving in this order. Oh well, who cares. Only 0 more minutes till I can stop and maybe either rest and sleep or eat some more food. Now what will I eat, cereal, hamburger??? who knows. I wonder how much I've typed already. Hopefully I typed a lot cause it would be cool if I would type really fast. One more minute right now. Why do I always put more periods than I need to???? I always do that with just about everything. but again who cares. Finally time is up!!!!!!!! 
__label__label1 I really don't want to do this but I have to I was thinking about this assignment and how we have to write about what we thaink about for 00 minutes and I couldn't believe when people say that they are alwaays thinking somethimes I don't think that any thing goes through my head at all When it is really late at night I think that my brain has had all that it can take for the day and it just stops thinking because people ask me what are you thinking and I tell them nothing but they don't believe me and I really don't think that any thing was going on I was totally blank maybe I am totaly so tired that I don't realze that I was thinking something because I mean you have to be thinking something all the time I mean your brain is amazing well I don't know what else to say but my landury is dring right now and I doupt that it will dry all the waaay because the drier on my floor is not very good I totally was unpreparesd for this year being my second year I reamember last year I brought everything and this year I forgot every thing and I was having to borrow landry detergent from a freshmen to do my landury wow huh that is wierd you thaink that I would be more prepared but I not worried about it iit is fine that way I get to meet more people and I will bea able to buy some laundry detergent later and one daay when they are out they can borrow some form me Well my room isn't totally done and I want to clean it but I have to much other stuff to do I wish that PROPNAME was really happy right now she is going trough a hard time and I want her to forget all this silly stuff and just trust that she will be alright I know that God will take care of her My boyfriend PROPNAME is super cute I think He is so great My friend just came in and we are going to study the bible with me and PROPNAME  she is a sophomore her name Elanin I have a carpet it is great and she is asking what this nonsense is all about sna I am telling he r that it is for psycology she has a friend that went to LOCNAME and lived there I was born is in LOCNAME LOCNAME but I am white skined I mean so I wonder if any one is going to really read this because that  woudl be a lot of reading may be they make the TAs read it because they have to do it she barely saw LOCNAME LOCNAME two weeks ago she is deprived ppooor hchild and I have seen them aall san I can't spell very good you see wow when will this end my friend PROPNAME is here yeah that is great she likes the way my room looks I am explaining wat I am doing as well wow so the last time I did a lot of typing was in highshool for computer claass it was fun but I was never really fast so I barely made an A in the class and I am all about makeing good grades what else ama I thingkin  hummmmm I donl't nknow I have action figures of luke sky waarker and I only have to typw  for two moarwe minittwoi and my hands are tiyred can't you see I know you can so how are you doning computer I s it ahard being a computeer??????  everyobody always tellsyou what to do My name is spell coool  because mey middle madmakl I am done 
__label__label0 I really wish that I could get on to the psychology pretesting page to get it over with but I've tried three times and it won't let me on. It's really driving me crazy. I feel like I have so much stuff that I need to get done right know, but if I space it out I can get it done. I need to learn to manage my time a little better. It was easy to do everything at the last minute in high school, but I'm in college know and I need to keep up with my assignments. I'm sure other people are feeling the same as me. If I could get everything done in one day I would feel so relieved, but I have to much to do in one day. My two other friends, live in an apartment, and there so boring. All they do is  sit at home all day and watch TV. I wish that they would go and do something, but if I asked them to do something they would probably do it. But, I just haven't asked. I'm still adjusting to moving. I come from a really small town, of about 0000 people, and I am overwhelmed at the amount of people that are here. I don't know where anything is at and I need to get my driver's license renewed, it has been expired for almost 0 months. One of my other friends goes to LOCNAME in LOCNAME. She says it is really hard and maybe she will transfer to LOCNAME next semester or year. That would be great for me, then I would know someone else here at the school. The chairs in the compurter lab are to close together. You can't move without hitting another chair. They need to spread them out. I want to go out one weekend and do something but I don't know  very many people here and I don't want to impose on anyone and just ask them if I can tag along. They probably would'nt mind. I think I am going to go home this weekend. My mom really gets on my nerves, or she did this past weekend. I  think it was because I was really tired. I really don't like going home because it is really boring and everyone just sits at this store called short stop. What Fun!!!!  I would rather sit at home and watch TV. I want to go and get my hair cut and highlighted and start going to a tanning bed but it always feels like I don't have enough time in the day. I know that I really do I just don't go get it done. I am really tired right know. I went to bed really late last night and had to get up early but I can't take a nap because I need to finish my  homework that I should have already finished. I also have to do my laundry. This chair is really comfortable though. I could fall asleep just sitting here. I hate paying for the copies that I make. I wish I had my own computer in my dorm room so that I wouldn't have to pay for them at all. It's a pain not having your own computer. I had to leave my at home so that my sister could use it if she needed. My parents said I could bring it but I'm in a supplementary room right now and didn't want to. My mailbox doesn't work and neither does our phone jack. I have two roommated, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I am supposed to get a check in the mail but it is not here yet and it was mailed on the 00 of August. but I guess it really doesn't matter since I can't get teh mailbox open yeat. I hope that no one else got my check because that would really suck. I could really use the money being here in LOCNAME there is a lot of stuff I could buy. Especialy with all teh stores around here. I really want some khaki pants without the creases in the front and some capri pants. I'm getting tired of doing this but since I have to do it I have to continue writing. Wait, my bad it has been over 00 minutes. I have been writing to long. About 0 minutes to long so I'll be going know. Bye!! 
__label__label1 As I am told to write this assignment, I begin my forced thinking by trying to find the correct ideas to write in this paper, instead of thinking whatever I want to in an incomplete and disordered way as I have been used to since I got out of school three months ago. So it's very difficult right nom, and you will notice that I constantly get distracted and start babbling incoherently. I'll try to write this paper very spontaneously so you get the right picture; but be warned. Right before looking at the incredibly outstanding WebPage (yeah right!) for my PSY class, I was thinking where else could I surf the web, or if I should go to the pool here at my LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, or if I should start reading a bit, which is a definite NO. I mean, it's Friday!, or if I should write to my parents down in LOCNAME LOCNAME, etc, etc. So basically, I was evaluating everything I could possibly do in this boring Friday afternoon, when what I really anted to do was nothing. But I've had exactly three months of that since school in LOCNAME ended the 00th of May; and I immediately decided to do something productive which is this. I guess my mind is still warming up from all that time of null intellectual activity, and I'll get right back on track again. To tell you the truth, I think I am ready to start doing everything the right way, and not to procrastinate, which has been a big problem since I was born (I guess) or maybe it was because of my upbringing, or just because of the culture which I am a part of. As you may notice, I read chapter one yesterday and I can certainly notice a change in how I view things in my life and the life of others. In other words, I am starting to think in a psychological perspective already!    The 00 minutes are over, and I can say that for a moment there, I was really concentrated and just writing all of this. but just as I noticed that the time was up, I started to wonder into something else again. I think that it was probably because my attention span is a bit short, but I know I'll get better. Thanks for taking a little swim into my spontaneous and disordered thoughts and I hope I was not that boring. Now I guess I've done my productive "thing" for today, and I can take a swim into the pool right in front of me! Or maybe not. we'll see what my mind tells me later.

__label__label0 Ok. I've never done this before, so here it goes. I've just come back from houston and I ams so glad that I'm here. I miss the turtles. you know. the ones that are in the pond that';s in the midding of nowhere. anyway. I got back here. and did my laundry. I borrowed quarters. and found out I have a million pennies. That and big bills. I'm hungry but not really hungry. it's wierd. I live at doby and somehow when I eat. it's like this feeling that I'm not that hungry and that I don't need to eat. but once I'm in my room. I'm like a starving maniac. I don't know. I miss my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel lonely here. I mean, I'm not really lonely because of all the friends I met here. especially my roommate. she's really nice. if shere weren't here. then I would be so bored out of my mind. I think what takes my time is actually just watching a lot of tv. I've gotten used to watching daily soaps. can you believe that? I never watch soaps. and then I get on the net and check my nonexistant mail. and eat and sleep. I study at nights. I really am hoping that I do well here. I really need tobecause I thing I slacked off so much my senior year. I've got to do well. I promised myself and my parents. how can you write so much. my brain is totally wearing off. I decided to do this because I have a lack of want to study anymore and I know I can't put this off any longer. it's just something I have to do. I need to make sure that whatever essay I get that I'll try to get it done asap and not be a procrastinator like I am always. well, I went home and wanted to see my goddaughter. but my friends changed their number again. and somehow they forgot to reach me. and I'm so upset because I don't know when I'll see them again. this tiem I took a car. my friend drove the car. it's so much more comfortable than the greyhound. what's bad about it is that you have to worry about a ride to the greyhound. I still don't think I can find my way around just by the bus. it would be so much eaiser if I had a car. so much easier. god, I don't know why I sold that car. well. PROPNAME and I would bne fighting over it anyway. he's my brother. That is if he'll get off the computer trying to email his girlfriend all the time. I'm sure he will run out of things to say. nevermind. I'm washing my laundry. and got. that pounding. next door is giving a headache. he pounds that music all the time. like all the time. until 0 in the morning. and I don't know how I deal with it. and yet we're friends. yess. I only have another 0 minutes to go. this is taking too long. way too long. the daily thing I do is thing about my boyfriend. he said that he's be here. and I trust him on that. but he's transfering from california and needs to taek the tasp. I wish he were here. he can't talk to me often cause he lives with  his sister. and she dosn't like me. but I have no idea why. I'm such a good girl. I mean that. I do nothing wrong. I'm thinking of rushing. to rush and not join. isn't that twisted. I hear everyone does that. just to go to the parites. and meet the ppl. my boyfriend would be so jealous though. I can't tell him in any way. I think he still does not trust me thought he says he does. my room mate is lucky. she saw her kinda boyfriend. though he didn't spend just time with  her. but time with  his friends too. this is so hard. I think time is coming to an end. it should. ok. it's there. bye. I'm just kidding. I wish it were. ok. done. 
__label__label1 I find your instructions extremely vague and confusing, I should hope your instructions would be more precise as to what you actually want, considering this is college. However, I will attempt to explain how "my mind works. "  At the moment, I am tired so I am in a cloudy state of mind. To be completely honest I am thinking I would rather be doing many other things with my friends than writing a prompt. I am also hungry because I have not eaten all day. Food is presently being prepared at my co-op so I am not particularly worried about starving. I find that if I something to be misleading or too broad, such as this writing assignment, I tend to get frustrated and pist off. Hence I tend to speak my opinion if I am in this state of mind. I am presently thinking about how much of a moron the person who wrote this assignment must be to try and make me think about my thoughts and then write about my thoughts as I was thinking about my thoughts. Sounds a little too contradictive to me. How could I think of any thoughts to write about when my thought is supposed be me thinking about my thoughts? I have found that I'll have an idea sometimes out of the blue, sometimes when situations spring them upon me. Whether the idea registers as a good one or not in my brain at the time, determines if I decide to take action, ponder it more, or dismiss it. My feelings at this point are that I would rather be having sex than writing a prompt as well. I could simply click a few buttons and check out some internet porn but I might as well keep writing. I feel even more tired now because I just got done shopping for four hours for my co-op. I don't particularly care very much for shopping but I do it because it is part of my duty to everyone at the co-op. I could use some music but am not near a stereo. Which brings up an important thought. I tend to ponder the ways and means of life when I play my own music better. I find that I helps me cope with and express my ideas in a form that is universal instead of English. My mind comprehends a thought and then interprets it as emotion or reason. Based upon the interpretation, my mind then clarifies what emotion or reason is to be felt or used and then determines a course of action. In the case of music, it sends impulses to my soul to tell my fingers what to play and in the case of reason it tells me what is rationally sound to deduce from my initial observations. 
__label__label0 I really hope my parents let me get a motorcycle. It would be so much easier getting around campus if I had one, versus driving a car and having to park two miles away and walk the rest of the way in one hundred degree heat. I would be the perfect candidate for a motorcycle, I never speed, I don't have a single traffic violation and I have been driving for two years, I am a very defensive driver, and it is the perfect thing to get arounf in at ORGNAME t. If I do get a motorcycle I am going to get a ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, it is a perfect bike for me because it is not to big, but it is still just as fast as the larger displacement bikes. Practicality is a big plus, but it would also be nice to have a nice bike to drive around campus. I think I deserve the motorcycle because the rest of my friends all have very nice things and I am the highest achieving out of all of them, all my friends have brand new cars and trucks, but I got a super used old piece of junk. I know I am going to buy all the things I never had when I make a lt of money, which hopefully will be within a couple of years. A lot of people tell me that PROPNAME t. engineers, especially electrical engineers, which is what I am,can make very good money while they are still in college with internships and summer jobs. Or my parents would give me the money they had saved up for college if I could get a company to pay for the remainder of my college, by signing an agreement to work for them for a given amount of time. My electrical engineering mentor whom also is an honors student said he made six thousand dollars a month for the summer after his sophomore year. If I could make that much and I was still having fun, like I am now, I would stay and get my masters in either engineering or business, because if I could make fifty to seventy thousand a year my first year out of college, who knows how much I could make with an advanced degree. I would spend so much money on my parents to try to show how thankful I am for putting me in the position I am. I would also spoil myself as well, I would have the finest clothes, the fastest cars, and the most material things. I also enjoy the fact that after four years of electrical engineering I  should be a pretty intelligent person, whom hopefully capable of law shcool, grad school, or beyond.   
__label__label0 okay today is friday at 0:00 and at the moment I am wondering what I will be doing this weekend. I am going home on saturday with my best friend. my best friend is catherine, but now she prefers to be called cat. I have known her since I moved to kingwood (north of h-town) 0 years ago. she was my first friend and we have been through a lot together. we've also had our years of separation too. she lives a street away from me. I am listening to the cure. but the tape sucks because I used to listen to it in my car and my car's stereo sucked. now I don't even have that car. we sold it the weekend before I moved to austin. which brings me to the topic of austin. austin always seemed like such a cool place before I moved here. now that I actually live here, I wish I was back in houston. in houston I knew so many people and there was almost always something to do. and most of my friends stayed there. it's really fucking hard to meet people here since there are so many people. ironic. I have not given up yet. I guess I just have to go out more. hey psychology is my fav class. I hate math and chem is just like math to me. I used to like english in high school but now it's goofy stuff like "everything's an argument". I bought some ginseng today and I donot think it works. I am still tired. I am looking around my room for things to talk about because thoughts do not pop into my head unless I am looking around. I just remembered I have been having really fucked up dreams. last nite I had my 0nd weird dream. in the first one I almost died and everyone acted really strange. my second dream a lamb was killed in front of me. and there was some blue gel that was everywhere. I can't really explain it and it would take too long and I have only 0 minutes left. since I am a slacker and only do the minimum 00. I drank sobe lizard blizzard today and it was good. I think it was pina colada. right before I did this assignment, someone called and I could not understand them because the were those people who mumble. anyways I thought they were doing a survey so I went ahead and cooperated. well it turns out I was filling a visa credit card application over the phone and she told me I would get my card in a couple of weeks. I thought it was funny because I do not want a credit card and was going to tell her at the end but I decided not to. maybe she will get a bonus for getting a customer. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I did something like this in my high school english class. she had us smell crayons and write the first thoughts that came into our head. and thats what I did except everyone else seemed to have the same thoughts (thoughts about elementary, art school, projects). the crayons did not spark up any thoughts about my childhood. so I hope this writing assignment isn't supposed to spark some certain thoughts. supasticious. 
__label__label1 it is about 000 and my roommates comp is making some noise and it has stopped now. I am now thinking about what I will (telephone noise) do when it is 000. that is when I will stop typing. I am thinking a bout my girlfriend. she is at a and m. I have a yaga sticker on my cd case. I took my cds out of my chest the other day, I mean yesterday, becaues I am not really worried about people stealing them any more. I once heard tht people sometimes steal toher peoples' pilows. my gir(keyboard is on my lap but io just took it off because I don't like that) I wish I could type faster but I can type plenty fast enough to do what I need to do. I have not really been using a lot of instant messenger lately. there are some people that I think it would be awkward to talk to like my gf. we kind of left withoutut breaking up but we both know it will not work ou. when I told my friend adam that she felt the same as me but I showed him her email and he believed me. she is not really like most girls and I said that was cool and he agreed with  me. I like to abbreviate when I typ and that comes from working on emails. I stopped for a seconnd to scroll up on the mouse because it does not move down by itself. I am now thinking how I do not type fast enough to say exactly what I think when I think it but I have to remember things (other things) as I am typing the thought that directly preceded it. my roommates are now staring at me as I type this and I am writing about it because that is what I am supposed to do. I hve stopped for a second to tell them about what the prof said today about the guy copyin gand pasting the computer manual and I thought that was pretty funny. my cousin did one of these stream of consciousness things and I don't think that I spelled that correctly. I think that this is getting pretty long enough and I will prolly cut it short before my time is up because I can. I know that rice university has the honor system and I don't know whether that would be cheating or not . it is now 000 and I have been typing for about nine minutes. whenever I write numbers I think it is easier if I just spell the number out but thinking back to this writing assignment, I have been spelling the time, so I don't know what that means. the social security comment was funny today. I accidentally came late to my french class today, the first day of school of all times, because I was playing squash and I thought it started at three instead of two. I actually think the yaga thing on my cd case is pretty cool even though yaga is not really a well known brand anymore. I would like to go to the gym todya but I would also like to et a  head start on the homework because I am still pretty motivated toward school, and I hope I will keep it up but I'm really not that sure because I know that this is different thatn highschool and I think I will like it more but my french teacher today told us some fascinating things about how speech is first started in babies and I was fascinated but then I went after calsss and apologized becase I was late. there is some real audo stuff we shoudl do for homework but I would like to do it in my own room instead of in the library becaus I don't know if we have to talk in to the computer or what. I am going to go now and I'd lkike to play some squash because it is fun. 
__label__label0 I don't understand how the man with the questions can be the smarter of the two. The man with the answers has to be the smarter. All the man with the questions know's that he know's what he doesn't know and wants to. But the man with the answers know's. Whatever he want to know he knows because that's how the question goes. There's no way for the man with the questions to more than the man with all the answers. One, the answer guy's going to know the answer. And people are always going well does he know how to get the answer?? well of course he does. just ask him how he got that answer. and he'll answer that question. what I don't understand is how this teacher is going to believe and only think that she's right. the answer was completely easy to comprehend. I hate that teachers get so arrogant. just because they know more of the subject they think they're knowledge is invincible against all others. how can you teach others and let them learn if you're unwelling to learn yourself?? it's totally bull. makes no sense to me. always dreamed about being a super hero. guess it's somewhat ironic that my vietnamese name translates to mean hero. I don't know I guess I have some type of super-hero complex. always want to help others always want special powers. always wanted to win the girl. always a dream about this girl. never see a face and can never hear her talk. I can see her figure and I can see how graceful she is. she walks be side me in my dreams. always want to hold her hand but afriad that I'll wake up when I touch her. so I walk beside her and look at her. I know I'm going to meet this person. I  can sense it. Real into the "Crow" look the romantic dark super-hero adventure story. brings out the use of love. people always take love for granted and if not love the good fortune that they get to be with or have a relationship with others. wonder if I'm a hopeless romantic. i can see myself taking my date on a walk or just laying there with her and talking. I don't see the sex, not that I wouldn't,  or much else. the tai kwon do club at this university is not very well trained. the main instructor may be a good fighter but his form sucks. to me form is the most important part of martial arts. adds gracefulness and at the experienced level makes movements faster stronger and completely balanced. it all comes from form. the traingle is speed balance and strength and not of that comes from bad form. or at least none of those three will continously exel without balance. most people don't see it that way. they think that compromising form for quick speed and strength is better. but they don't look in the long run. just like in chess the game is all about the long run. and with mastering balance, speed and strength will always become faster and stronger. then there are those that are lazy and don't even care for form and try to show off their katas with feet not lined up and hands out of place. with such bad alignment energy will not flow correctly . people get so arrogant and greedy. makes me sick 
__label__label0 I'm bored I wish it was friday so I cn go home I wonder what ash is doing I need to stop smoking this cd isn't that good I should throw away that phone card I need to get the car serviced this weekend I don't think I can write for 00 miutes oh well I wonder if I'll see her this weekend I hope bennigans calls today I really need that job as long as they le me off for homecoming I need to talk to steve about geting tickets for Rent in november I hope him and camille are allright I wonder how kenny and jen are doing this is stupid and doesn't make any sense I was stupid last weeken I hope she's not stilll mad at me I got to learn to keep promises I'm bored I don't know what to say so I guess I'l rambling for another 00 minutes. every little thing that you do I wonder how you make music symbols on the computer I wish I could use my mac this pc sux "friends slowly drift apart they give away their hearts" I need to find the lonestar single for ashley. I wonder if she's right about the gnats that would be tripped out but if she is then why doesn't julie visit me I don't think julie went to heaven that's no good but I'm not going to tell ash I think that because she took it bad enough I need to visit her grave this weekend that was wierd I got teary eyed just thinking about her is that really all t takes? I wonder if I can listen to the dance now or if its still too emotional yep turns out it is but its all good I can control it its more than a feeling hahahaa I'm really running out of things to say I wonder who gets to read all this crap? can't be much fun excpet to laugh at I bet the psychology department gets together on the weekends  and reads these when they're drunk who knows that ould be wierd 0 minutes to go  no not even that thank god that songs over thats just too spooky like in 0th sense and every time it starts I get a chill I wonder if that means jules is visiting high jules! :) how's it going? k thats about nuff enjoy the end 
__label__label1 I kind of feel like my best frined in college station is going to change too much and then we went get along like we use to. we connect so well and can laugh about the stupidest things for hours together. she just rushed and I am not into that kind of thing at all. I went to my first frat party the other night and I did not like it at all. all the girls were skanks and I just stood ther for like 00 minutes and totally did not fit it. I feel like I am kind of figuring out who I am now. in high school you kind of do the cool thing and then act just like everyone else. in college since ther are some manyh people, you can act like yourself and do what you want to. it is kind of weird not knowing who I really am. it is kind of like I put up a false front for the past whatever years. ut is a really cool school. I am not making friends like I wish I were, but I feel somewhat of a tenativness whenever I put in a situation with people I do not know. I am not shy or anything, but things are just kind of different and weird. it is nice trying to find myself or whatever though. I have felt kind of weird lately. I don't think I have eaten enough food during the past week. my appetite is not so keen with the dorm food. the food is not that tasty and I don't want to try any kind of meat substances. I need to get some protein though and shape up. with the long days and heat and all of that stuff, I need to eat better so I can have enougth energy. I get what they mean whenever they say people change whenever they get to college. one of my best frineds who goes to ut and I have not spoken in the last 0 weeks. it is for the better though, I kind of think you can be friends for only so long. I wonder how people can just meet someone in class or in the dorms and immediatley that day or the next go out in the night for me personally, it take s a little longer to get to know someone. my roomate is kind of weird. I expect her to be my best frined and stuff, but it is not like that. I was just thinking of when I told my dad I would never leave him and go to college. I was like five years old when I said that. wow. I feel kind of hurt from a couple of friends. one of them is acting very strang around me and won't tell me stuff about her and her so called boyfriend. I don't understand why she jsut wouldn't talk to me and say he this is what is going on! it is not like I am going to jump on her. I am not a mean person, really I am not. I am just meeting so many people and am faced witht he challenge of deciding who I can confide my secrets and fears in and hwo I can't trust. it is a very tricky situation that can't be dealt with correctly. I am starting to feel kind of tired again. I need that extra energy to get me through the day. there aren't very many interesting things about me, I am jsut like any other regullar person, but I think my personality is pretty cool and can be someting fun to get to know. when I was 0, I ate an entire bottle of childrens chewable tylenol because I thought that they tasted good. I had to go to the emergency room and get my stomach pumped, that is th eone thought that jumps into my head as being the most interesting and unusual. those mattresses in our rooms aren;t that comfotable. in certain places there are areas that are pretty bumpy and lumpy. I guess it is from the other people who stayed in these rooms. I wonder how much they clean and sanitize the rooms inbetween the people who stay in them. I wonder how much of the old persons presence can still be found in the room. my mom insisted on cleaning the room when we got here. pretty werid. she is a clean and neat freak. I guess I get some of that from her. I ahve already found myself cleaning and vaccuming our room two or three times in the last two weeks. I just like things to be clean and I don't like to have a dirty room. my side of the room is usually the cleaner side and my roommate has her stuff all over her bed and stuff. I don't know how come there is not that much light in these rooms. you would think that as a dorm room, there would have to be enought light to study, instead, there isn't nearly enough to wash your face and brush your teeth. my desk kind of sucks. ther is only room for the desk and that is about it. my neck gets tired of looking down at my books on my bed. very bad for you. 
__label__label0 The computer that I am on is not very good, so oi hope that it doesn't kick me off, because it would really suck to have to do this all over again. I don't reallly understand how writing my miscellaneous thoughts will help me to learn about psychology. I do see how it can help others study my psychology, but what do my thoughts have to do with a class on introdutory psychology. This last few days I have really missed my girlfriend, seeing as how she is still at home, finishing her senior year. But thankfully I get to go home in 0 days and will hopefully get to see her for an entire saturday. I love her more and more every day which leads me to the conclusion that absence does make the heart grow fonder! I got a job as a houskeeper in the union on the weekends from three to midnight. The sorry thing is that I won't get to see any football games and also my dad is coming to visit me this weeekend, and won't get to see me untill monday because of my job. the good thing about my job is that I really won't have a chance to party. I have been sober for a year now and would lie to keep it that way, and my job will hopefully keep me away fromthe parties. I have given up drugs, cigarettes, and alchohol which leaves me with only reforming my dirty mouth. The way in which I plan to do this is by wearing a rubber band around my wrist and popping myself everytime I cuss. I also let the people around me know about this so that they can inform me of the times that I cass without my knowing it. College life has been pretty good to me so far, but my cousin is not responding nearly as well as I am. I have heard that she calls hrying everynight to her house. But I think that it is because of the fact that her parents, particularly her mother have done everything for her and always spoken for her the entirety of her life. Now that she is own her own, she doesn's know what to do with herself. I feel sorry for her sometimes, bt other times I think that it is about time she learned what life outside her family is like. I do hope that things get bette for her. and that things stay good for me 
__label__label0 I wonder if my parents are coming to visit me this weekend because I need a lot of things. In fact I need a lot of things. I hope this creating stuff really works. O yeah, that math 000c class seems really intimidating. I wonder if I can really get through because I was struggling through the review session today. Well, at least  tomorrow is friday. thank god. I need a major break. it is funny because I really and honestly want to achieve so much yet I feel so far behind from where I think I need to be. I'm just falling falling far behind. I must get back into shape and into the jist of things. I seriously need a massage. My legs are killing me. I must have walked ten thousand miles today. only 0 months left to go. great. that pennebaker professor seemed pretty cool. I don't think I want to drop that class because it is so hard to get into but it also seems like it will be interesting. I have never taken a psychology course. ba000 can wait. I wonder how all my friends are doing back home. do they miss me?  probably not. I have been here for a week almost. I have met some new people but not as many as I should have. too bad. well, we still have a long time. I think I should join some clubs but I don't know where. hmmmm. this song sucks. I can't wait until friday. I miss everyone I knew. it sounds strange but I really miss them. I need to work out some more. I feel so tired. but I am really surprised I am not  homesick. though I do miss the food. I can live like this. it seems pretty fun even though I don't have a car. I think my dad and my brother went bowling. I feel so sleepy. I miss playing the piano and the guitar. I came here to escape a lot of things but it seems that the distance has brought me closer to what I wanted to get away from. lucky for me there are a lot of distractions because sometimes I find myself thinking about somebody more than I should. I don't deserve this. why does this sound so depressing?  let's t hink happy thoughts. that girl van that I met today seemed pretty cool. really very outgoing and even waited for me after class. that's pretty cool. I am glad I have dan as a roommate. his sense of humor is always there. I feel like playing basketball but I need to catch up with schoolwork already. the sad things is that it is the second day only. I can't believe I have the same 0 classes with tyson, some guy I met at camp. what are the chances of that?  and Lira my second cousin was in my economics class. so is angela johnson from my old high school. but the professor. well  nevermind. so many memories. time to make some new ones. should I call my parents tonight. yea I t hink I will. dang I still have to do that calculus homework. I hope it is not that long. I need to do a lot of reading too. for mis 000 so I can get caught up. well the good thing is that my day is over at lunch time. yay!!!  but dan is going back to houston and leaving me all alone. so many th ings to do so little time. but I love the ut experience. I really do. hookem horns. 
__label__label1 lately I think of how I have to study and study hard because I would hate to be putting my family's financial status at risk. then I keep an eye out for work thats on campus and make plans to call only I wonder why I'm not getting on the ball with what I know is important. I'm worried about money, very worried about not following throught and disappointing my parents. you know I feel like going back to arlington and visit my family and friends, but I don't want them to think that I'm very homesick cause I don't think that I am . not really. it's relaly only been two weeks away. but it will be labor day weekend so it's okay to be home, I think. wandering if my mom actually plans on meeting my boyfriends mom. kinda nervous because his mom just found out we were going out and so . who knows what she's thinking. I'm trying to figure out how to tell my dad. he reassured me that he's not setting limits on me just that he wants me to take care of school first. why is it my roommate and best friend seems to be in this room as little as possible. I think I'm in here more than I should be but then I like being alone sometimes. wonder if my friends think that I'm just anti-social and don't want to try things. I don't go out of the room except to run, go to class, do an errand. just remembered that I have to go get some handbook for art class and its sold at  I T copy. I just don't feel like going to get it right away. think I'll get it after a class tomorrow since I'm already going to be out. don't want to go to room and then go back out until I have class. why do I wait? my dad told me not to put things off, and I said I know but I still do it. scary thinking that I have a whole 0 maybe 0 years of schooling left until I am really on my own. i feel kind of on my own right now. just without parents. when I think of my parents I remember when they left after helping me move in. the days before I thought I was going to cry when they said goodbye because I have been so family-oriented but as they left I came close to tears but they didn't come. hmm that's weird. I love my mom so much that I can't think of why I didn't break into tears. she's always been there. and my dad. well. i came very close to it when he told me he loved mebecause I think the last time I heard him say that to me was so far back I can't remember. then my boyfriend came to spend time with me before he starts school. i was pretty sure I would be okay and that I wouldnt cry. then he left and I cried. lots. strangely he came back and then when he really had to leave I didnt cry. people have a way of disappointing you and making you feel bad. I thought this guy was my friend even when we were distant and then I had to find out that he told a girl I am no longer friends with that he didnt like me. I was in shock I didnt know what to do. my friends have a thing for changing their minds quickly and then saying that they are not different. 
__label__label0 Why is'nt my roomate quieter doesn't he undersatnd that I'm working on a homework assignment, I never really seems to care what I'm doing he just goes on even if it hinders what I'm doing he pushes an awful lot too. I don't know if I can handle another semester with him, I wish I wasn't as nice and well behaved and just told him bluntly and straight to his face that he was bothering me, I miss my girlfriend she's the only one that seems to understand how I feel even though she claims she has a hard time reading me she always seem to know the right things to say and do to cheer me up even in the worst of moods,, why do the simplest things that my roommate do bother me so much, I wish he would just understand that I want to try to go to bed at a decent time even when he isn't tired he doesn't have to go to bed just respect the fact that I'm tired and need some quiet my girl friend always knows when to leave me alone and let me have my space. why do major things that are poletial problems not bother me such as the possibility of failing a test or a bank possibly screwing me over, a bank can take in thousands of dollars a day but have the indecentcy to charge $0 for a money order in a bank that I'm a member to even the employees think it's outragious, twenty miutes doesn't usually seem like a long ammount of time but when your continuously writing for that time period it seems much longer. homework seems a lot worse then it is I don't mind homework when I'm actually doing it it just when I start it off but more when I stop and come back to it after have a good time. i wish I were stronger than I am socially, if I were more out going but then I wouldn't be who I am now and my friends wouldn't be who they are and I wouldn't have my girl friend who seem to be the center point of me retaining any strength and going on.             
__label__label1 Annoyance is about the only word I can think of at this moment to describe how I feel. Today has been awful. Why doesn't anything ever work out the way I wish it would? Everything I needed to accomplish today has been a filure> I can't find a job because I can't get on a computer because me UTeId is all out of wack. I miss my friends back home and I miss being a part of my family. They just seem to go on so wonderfully without me. I guess I am the one who wanted to move out and be independent, but it'd be nice to know they all still care about me and are concerned with how I'm doing. It's so hard being so alone all the time. I wish I were making more friends. I wish I would join an organization or I wish I had rushed. Maybe life would be more fun if I were in  a Sorority. Maybe I just wasn't cut out for college. I want to be grown up and finished with college and heve my career so badly. I'm tired of just meandering around with no real purposee in my life. I want to start my real life, and I know this can't be it because I'm not happy with it. I want to fall in love and marry and have a family and a meaningful job. I just needsome meaning in my life. I don't know what I'm here for. I know what I want to do with my life, but time is getting in my way and I'm angry because of it. And I'm hungry; physically and metaphorically speaking. this cannot be the way college will be forever. It's so much worse thatn High school. It's so big. It intimidates me to think that there are more poeple on the Ut campus thatn live in my home town. I have a class that has twice as many pople than I graduated with in it. It's a real shock. It's traumatizing to go from being well known and well loved to not being either one at all. It hurts deep down and is extremely depressing and discouraging. But I shouldn't let it get me down, I should hang on to the confidence I've still got, because it's the only thing that can get me through "the best years of my life". Yeah, right. 
__label__label0 I don't know how to put my thoughts into words. my mind wonders all the time. I'm really tired. the dog is taking a nap -- I wish I was taking a nap, too. I stayed up too late last night. church was hot and not very interesting. I wonder what time we're leaving today. the houston comets are playing very good. I guess they are still mourning the loss of PROPNAME PROPNAME. her death was so sad. where did that crazy dog go now. I bet she went to take a nap in my bed. my typing probably distrubed her. crap! the comets can't score to save their life. good shot. who the heck is that girl. PROPNAME PROPNAME is incredibly fast. I wonder why she doesn't get a long with cynthia cooper. pass the ball. rebound. is that a play or what. my sister is being such a baby today. she is so bossy, and when she doesn't get her way, she throws a fit. I never stick up for my brother, but the one time I do, it infuriates her. I can't wait to get back to austin, and I'll stay on my side of town, and she can stay on her side. I won't call her for a couple of days, so she can get completely over her temper tantrum. I hope eryn doesn't call me for a few days. I just want to stay at my dorm and relax and study by myself. this is the stupidest commercial. I hate that PROPNAME PROPNAME character. I have to go to the bathroom, but I still have 00 minutes to type. I have got to go on a diet. I'm getting extremely fat. I wonder when that aerobics program gets started. I hope it won't be too hard. I have got to set the vcr to tape my soaps for the week. I hate missing those shows. that girl is such a weiner. she is always getting hurt. I'm getting sick of typing. oh that was a cheap foul. I wonder how they wash there hair when it's in those braids. I bet it stinks. that girl is ugly. he is a horrible dresser. I wonder how much money they make. my watch is rubbing my hand. my eyes are tired. I haven't seen this commercial before. it's kind of dumb. my mind is starting to take a nap. it isn't wondering so much anymore. I hate that when I get in a daze and just stare at people. it's embarrassing. this game is getting boring, I wonder if there are any other games on. when do the cowboys play today. how much more room do I have. I guess I get as much room as I want. cynthia cooper is cocky. why do they wear lipstick when they play. that is retarded. they dress up to get sweaty and work out. I wonder how loud it is in that arena. my head itches. I think someone is driving up to my house. that's a walk! the comets are looking better. is it supposed to rain today. it's pretty cloudy out there. my throat hurts. I wonder if I'm getting sick. man I'm tired. can I ever run out of water in my eyes. every time I yawn my eyes fill completely, and --- the phone is ringing --- I looked at the caller id, but I don't want to talk to that person. I still have to go to the bathroom. well it's been 00 minutes, so I'm going to quit. I hope I did this right.      
__label__label1 Right now I am tired, sleepy, and restless. Stressed about finishing work and school. I have a lot of work to get done before going to school. I want to get off to a good start this year and not fall behind. I need to finish this assingnment and get to others before school starts. I'm hungry and I need to make some food along with other things I need to do. I think I'll make a sandwich. I also need to take a shower before I go. I need to get my clothes out of the dryer so I have something to wear. I think I'll wear shorts today. I'll also wear a baseball cap. I want to pickup a cd on my way back from school today. Also need some groceries. I hope I don't have much homework tonight. Only a few more days until the weekend. I'm going to LOCNAME this weekend, that will be fun. This is a three-day weekend. I'm looking forward to having three days off. I'll probably hang out with friends and go to a movie this weekend. Oh, yeah, PROPNAME is back in town this week. I'll probably hang out with him this Friday, cause Saturday morning I have to go out of town. What is today?  Tuesday. That means I only have two classes today. That's pretty good, but the next two days are pretty long days, and then Friday is another short day. My 00 minutes is  almost up. I'm glad I got this writing assignment done and out of the way. Well, I guess that's it.  
__label__label0 I wonder what this assignment is about. the tv is on and some stupid commercial is going on I need to go get some dinner by 0:00. wow that's a nice car on tv, I need to earn some money so I can get a better car. that reminds me my car is still broken down at taco bell and I need to call them and tell them not to tow it or I need to get it towed to a shop like the pep boys across the street man cars suck when they're not running I really wish I had lots of cash so I could buy a more reliable newer one I should call that guy tomorrow about the job so I can earn more money my mind hit a blank spot where I can't really think about anything. then how am I typing if I'm not paying attention to anything? I must be paying attention to something because I'm typing or maye I'm just doing it unconsciously I'm thirsty I need to get something to drink but I can't leave my desk ther's some water right there I'm goin to grab it as soon as I finish this thought how long has it been? only 0 or 0 minutes I need to organize my thoughts and my bedroom, they're both messy that pizza on tv looks really good hey I have a coupon for a free pizza maybe I should order one I wonder if they will deliver a free pizza or they will probably make me pick it up how far is the nearest pizza hut I think only a few blocks away but I should save that for when I'm out of cash and really tired of dorm food I think I already am tired of it but I will be more tired of it in a few weeks my eyes are kind of itchy I guess it's probably allergies saturday night live is on tv it's pretty funny I wonder what it would be like to be in the saturday night live cast I bet there are all kind of hidden relationships and tensions between the characters that go on behind the scenes like with PROPNAME PROPNAME from the older cast how much time has passed I've got about 0 minutes left then I will stop and look at the second assignment and if it won't take too long then I'll do it before dinner but if not I probably wont get to it for a few days because of all of the things I have to do in the next few days let me figure out what I need to do. I need to get my books, call that guy, deal with my car, clean my room, e-mail my friend from high school, check to see if my camera has arrived if not I need to e-mail that guy and see what's taking so long what are they doing on tv that's strange what else do I need to do lets see. I need to go to my classes and go get some groceries, talk to my parents about the money I owe them damn I need to find a way to get lots of cash to repay my debts and buy some of the stuff I've wanted for so long I haven't actually bought anything I just wanted to buy in probably a year because of all the money I owe I should have worked more last summer but I guess its ok that I didn't because I was sick for most of it I'm so tired of getting sick it really makes me angry and tense about things ok what time is it okay I've been writing for about 00 minutes I guess that's enough now I'm going to stop this and finish up this assignment 
__label__label0 I feel somewhat confident but also unsure about myself entering college. I am  excited about what might become of this expeience and oppotunity but am also  somewhat unsure about some of the greater unknowns out there on a university  cmapus. I am sitting in a some what comfortable chair and that is quite  relaxing although I shoulnd't be so concerned with feelings although they are  important but they can get you into trouble and can misled you sometimes. This  psychology course should be an interestingone and I am looking forward to  learning about personality especially . I have a somewhat usual but unusual  personality,  I feel proud about that which I probably shouldn't because  anything that I have is a gift endowed by the Creator. Pride is something that  creeps into me and this disappoints me when I see it evident in my life  everything that I have is from God ultimately and so I shouldn't have any reason  to be proud of something That God has given to me while I have done some of the  work in the eternal scopeof thing s I will alos be held accountable for any  gifts that I have received. this assignment is somewhat interesting although it  is not sometying that I have done very often I don't like to do things new  naturally but there is something of a Holy Spirit power that has recently  enabled me to do things that I normally wouldn't have had the strength to do pon  my own strength. I think that the truth of PROPNAME PROPNAME is the most amazing  thing that I have ever encountered I also feel the same way about it . There is  a lonely feeling that tends to pervade me right now but this is soon wiped away  by the invocation of the All- Holy Name ofJesus. Personality is utterly  intriguing I think because it can teeel us so much about people and understand  why we have tendencies to do the things that wed do. I don't really like pearl  jam  but I do like classicla music and I love this group called third PROPNAME. College is such an interesting concept that it comes at a time that we are  learning to think about things for ourselves and discerning truth from lie. This is a much greater method on the whole than havingh someone else think for   you lest it be God seeing to it how He is the only One that knows all andcan  never err. Truth seeking must be doen in a very humble frame of mind though fo  rif we expect more than we humans are capable of or wait to long to make a  decision, seeing how life is so sort and essential we could die at any time as f  ar as we know. The clock says that I am completed with 00 minutes of the  proposed 00 and I don't know if that is good or bad because I rather enjoyed  this assignment seeing to the fact that I got to talk about some of the thing s  tha t enter my mind sometimes peroidically and sometimes frequently. it is  interesting to observe radom thoughts and frequency of thought and how many  mistakes I amke on the keyboard wh 
__label__label1 I'm not totally sure what I'm supposed to be writing about. I will be glad to get this assignment out of the way, because I have so much stuff to do. My classes aren't too bad, but there's just lots of outside assignments to do. I feel like I'm always busy, especially with being in a sorority. I love the one I'm in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. We have 0 meetings every week and then other activities. I don't feel like it's possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. I have been having a lot of fun, though. My mom thinks I party too much. She doesn't really understand that I do work on school stuff, and I do know that classes are the real reason I am here in the first place. I know that I can't go out every night. I don't think I'll have too much of a problem, because I can balance everything and plan ahead if I know something big is going on over the weekend. My seminar class is kind of annoying. It's a stress-management course, and I picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and I really wanted a seminar. Everything's pretty much common sense. We have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. I do stress sometimes, and I always have a lot on my mind, but I don't let it bother me. I'm very organized, and I always find  a way to do everything that I need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. My room mate does stress a lot though. She's always a little edgy and panicky. She kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. She kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. She's one of those "the glass is half empty" kind of people. It bothers me sometimes, because I like to be positive. I'd rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. I also don't think there's a point in worrying about something unless you have to. I'd rather just wait and see what happens. I really hope the guy comes to hook up the Ethernet in my room soon. I've had so many problems with my computer, and I hate having to come to the lab. It's just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. It'd be more comfortable too, and convenient. My dad bought my computer when I moved in, but it had the wrong kind of Ethernet card installed. Now it has the right one- as long as PROPNAME comes to hook me up!  I hope there are no other problems, because then I won't know what to do. I'm so illiterate when it comes to computers, and I hate that because I don't understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what's wrong. I think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. I was kind of surprised. I wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the Internet and just mailed to teachers. It's definitely less of a hassle. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in LOCNAME. I really want to see PROPNAME. He's such a great guy, and I think I  really hold back from getting too close to him. I guess it's because I knew I'd be moving, and I don't want to be attached to someone that I can't always see. It'll be nice to see him though. I might get to see one of my best friends too. She goes to ORGNAME, but she'll be home this weekend too. I think she's having tons of fun at college too. I'm definitely glad I came here. Sure it's big, but it would bother me if it wasn't. I'm having fun, and there's always something going on. I love that about big  cities. I can't imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. I would get so bored. I guess it would be different if you grew up  there, though.     
__label__label1 Right now I am sitting at home checking my email and different things. A lot of things are running through my head. I need to read for my classes, I need to go to work, and I need to clean the house. I am interested in this psychology class and I like Dr. PROPNAME a lot. He is funny and keeps class interesting. I look forward to class and believe that I will learn a lot. My sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. I am worried about getting everything done and think that I have to much to do. I am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad I don't have class on Friday and this weekend on Monday. I am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. I am sorry that I will miss the ORGNAME football game against ORGNAME but the last one I went to was extremely hot and I was drenched with sweat. I had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. I love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that I attend a university with so much pride and support. I love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. I saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that I couldn't believe it. It is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. I don't need to buy any more UT clothing, etc. I have to much stuff already, but every time I go into the bookstore I buy something with UT on it. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and I don't even know if I am doing this right. I am just writing what I am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. I think it has been about twenty minutes so I am going to end the assignment. I enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. It felt like I was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and  no one will probably read it anyway.   
__label__label1 I am really hungry right now. I wish I could go and get some cooking form home. I miss my mother's cooking. I won't be able to get any home cooking until I go home next month. That's a long time . I wish I could go home labor day weekend. I wonder why everyone else is homesick,but I'm not. I miss my parents,but I guess I fell that I'm going to go home soon. Why is this stupid song on mtv. I hate when they have those people interrupt the video to talk about why they like the video. I wonder wat I'm going to do today. I wish I had my car up here with me so I could go to the mall whenever I wanted to. I hate being immobile and relying on other people to tote me around. I need to go pick up some trashbags for my room. I wonder if the Jexter store is open. I don't fell like going down to the drag just for some trashbags. I ove this song on tv. I should put the ck in and listen to it. That reminds me I should meet my roommates who always play that loud music across from the bathroom. I guess I'll meet them when we finally have our wing meeting. I feel like going to that stepshow today, but I don't have a way. That's another reason why I wish I had my own car. I really need to wash my clothes today. I don't feel like it ,but I don't do it now I'll never do it. I'm glad my mom taught me how to wash clothes. That would be pretty bad if I went of to college and didn't know how to wash clothes like my roommate. That's one downside to living on your own, your parents don't do your laundry anymore. Now that's stupid. How are people supposed to know that on saturdays the parking spaces by the field are reserved. I can't even contact PROPNAME so she can move her car. I don't understand why they didn't tell people when they assigned parking spaces. I hope they don't tow her car. She should have left her brother's phone number. She doesn't need anything else bad to happen to her. She already doesn't like being here. Poor thing I hope she feels better soon. I can't think of anything to say to make her feel better. I know I look bad because I haven't shed a tear over my parents and she's been bawling. Okay my 00 minutes are up so I'm going to quit typing now. 
__label__label0 why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and I to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 0 years, and all of a sudden I have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, I don't think so. I mean, it is a nice gesture, I guess. I would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, I hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. I eamn, I did come here to expand my horizons. I do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. So, I decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. Why? it isn't like I am enjoying this. I would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. I really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. But, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and I love that. Even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. She is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, I could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. It was almost as though I could read her mind. My foot itches. Tomroow, I am going to church for the first time in about 0 months. I don't know why I stopped going, maybe I got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. I am not really sure, but I am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because I definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. No, that is not the right word, I am not lonely, maybe just scared of what I am to become being spiritually dark. Why did that happen? I don't understand so many things, but I am trying. I have also been going with PROPNAME, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. I really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. I miss my mom. I hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. He is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. He isn't very attentive, but very creative. I miss my family, we were very close. Except for my dad, he is a jerk. I wonder sometimes if I will ever find it important to speak to him again. I don't really think so. He does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. He doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every BAD move, without noticing the good ones. I am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but I am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. Maybe it will come in time. I hope that I am not studying the wrong things for class. I often wonder how I am going to make the grades. I mean, I know I can, I am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. Especially coming to college for the first time. I never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. Once again, I am so glad to have PROPNAME here to keep me in my comfort zone. It is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but I am struggling with all of these new people. I have not found the time to REALLY get to know anyone that is new yet. It is like they are all aquaintences. I am sure that that will all change, once I am in the swing of things and I do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. Why are we doing this assignment? Am I part of some sort of research? I would like to know, I feel like I am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. Maybe I am just another research rat. Why do they always do research on rats? I don't get it? If you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? I mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. But I do not like that animal research idea at all. Give it up. We are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. We should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. Why should we impose onto other species? What if it was the other way around? Wouldn't we think. "Why do they even care? It isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?" People are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. It almost ruins the whole experience of life on LOCNAME. or mars for that matter. Do we care if there is life on LOCNAME? Unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? Technology is killing man, man is killing himself. Life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y0k crap. Oh well, I don't understand. Why am I thinking all of this at one time? Pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as I am typing, but I suppose I am thinking it for a reason. I got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. Why? I asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. I mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. I think I deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, I am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. I miss the punk rock scene in houston. I am sure I just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. I found a club that I am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. I am extremely excited about that. I wonder if I am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. I wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. Then, all of the thoughts will explode and I will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? I definately think so. Well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. I want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. I can type extremely fast for some weird reason. I am done. enjoy me *cara* 
__label__label1 I am feeling very confused at this point in my life. I am thinking about my future and my career. I am also very nervous about my classes and how much effort each class will require of me. I miss having the reassurance of my friends and family. People say that things get better but at this point I don't see that happening. I am glad that I came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then I would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. Now that I am here I am sure that I was better off at a smaller school. But I think I will really enjoy what I learn about other people while I am here. At the present moment I am having to learn time management. I have load of work to do in each class and I feel that if I am not doing my work continuously that I will fail. On top of that, I feel that although I am spending most all my time doing work I am still not understanding everything. I guess I wonder why people want to give us so much work. Now I just heard that on girl that I went to school with just died. What is going on with this world. I feel that more and more people are just dying. How are we suppose to concentrate on work when all this other stuff is going on. Now I am talking to a friend and she just told me about what happened. Anyway, I have lots of work to do and I have or I feel that I have no time to do my work. I wish I was back home resting instead of here having to work my hardest. Anyway, I hope that this year will get better for me so that way I won't be as unhappy. So I guess I should have a positive outlook on life. Wouldn't it be nice if everything went the way people wanted it too. No complications what so ever! I hope that God, family and friend will get me through all my tough times. I should me thankful for what I have because some people are not as fortunate. 
__label__label1 Hmmm. don't know what to write. Maybe PROPNAME will call back soon. Glad PROPNAME is not coming home tonight, place all to myself. Fabulous. Wonder where PROPNAME is and if she wants to do something tonight. I do, but I am tired and I have stuff to do, but bored with stuff. The room is dark and lonely, but good that PROPNAME isn't here. Hopefully PROPNAME will call soon. Haven't been able to have a good conversation with her since she went to LOCNAME. Miss her a lot, wish she were in PROPNAME's place. But, she'll be here in four days for PROPNAME. PROPNAME is coming up soon, I can't wait. Wish PROPNAME would go with us, so it'll be less like couples, but PROPNAME and PROPNAME will be there, we'll have to see them. They are PROPNAME's friends and he probably wants to see them too, probably not as much as he wants to see PROPNAME, but its cool, it would be cool to hang out with those two guys. That way I could get PROPNAME's number and I could network with what he's doing. It's all about the networking. PROPNAME is going to be so much fun, I can't wait, but it would be better if PROPNAME and PROPNAME weren't going. But what could you do? Hopefully PROPNAME will take his car and us true PROPNAME fans can get there early and not wait for the non PROPNAME fans. I'm so tired. Definitely bored too. Those neighbors are so random, they are always making noise, but they are such dorks. They better contain themselves or we will have a definite problem. And what is PROPNAME's deal? She has totally distanced herself. Is it because she thinks PROPNAME and my friendship has become too much or does she just not like me or is it because her friend was in town? I definitely feel neglected. I mean I try to be cool and nice to her. I try to be nice to everyone, I'm nonconfrontational, that's probably why people like me. I don't know. I wish PROPNAME didn't take that stupid poster that I wanted. Every time I look at it, it pisses me off. God. She is definitely annoying, I swear what a poser of everything, hey maybe you could get an identity of your own and stop stealing everyone else's. Fabulous. PROPNAME is so awesome, I can't wait. Could I love you, could you love me? I definitely need a guy, I am so sick of all these couples, it's so annoying. I mean I deserve a guy, right? It has been a while. I'm just too damn picky, but I am about everything. It's good right? Quality over quantity? I hope so. But, more people are more fun and you can always find something to do. I need to find or run into those two girls from the other night, they seemed cool, maybe people I could get along with. Mainly that PROPNAME girl, the other reminded me of PROPNAME PROPNAME and she had some tongue thing, which both could be bad. That stupid bear. God! Oh my neck hurts, it's so stiff. I definitely need a good massage. Another thing boyfriends are good for. Good seeing mom today, definitely miss all that. But, I'm being strong. Definitely almost started crying about all of PROPNAME's problems today. Which is weird, because I hardly know her anymore, but I guess we have some sort of childhood bond. Maybe, it is because I feel like I can sort of relate. It was weird, maybe I just need to cry or something, get it out of the system. 
__label__label0 I feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. I find that it gets so monotonous when I see the same person day in and day out. I don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so I guess I am very wary of commitment, although I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. I miss the physical contact of a relationship. Maybe I haven't been getting enough hugs lately. I haven't had one for about a week now. It does make a difference. You have to fend for yourself here at LOCNAME. No one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. I have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that I deem worthwhile. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I am gradually learning how to handle it. I have never realized before how incredibly independent I am. I am in fact, lonely a lot more than I thought I was. At home I didn't feel it as much because I lived with four other people. But now, I notice that I get timid when I am alone. I didn't have a roommate for 0 weeks, and I thought I would like it because I would get privacy and free reign over the room. But I didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. I started eating a lot to fill the void. I never could figure out why I binged so much before, especially during high school. But now I think that I felt alone, and I was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. So I would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. That's weird how I wanted to be even more alone when I felt isolated. Now I want to get involved with people as much as possible since I have recognized the problem. PROPNAME and I will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. I want to have my meals with at least one other person. It sucks to be alone, but at least I know that now. I have ten minutes to write. Working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. It's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and I will be eating something for lunch soon. I don't want to eat alone! Maybe PROPNAME will eat w/me. I wonder what PROPNAME's up to now. He had an 0:00 class this morningI think? We spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. I like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. He's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. I don't know if I would want to start something with him. It would be a fun thing and add some "extra" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and I would not want to lose his friendship. I will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. I just want to be able to spend some time with him! I know I will though. There is that Navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and I think I should go. I don't want to know what I look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. Will I feel pressured a lot about GodI just don't know if I'm on the right track. I read that the best way to get closer to God is to Spend time with Him. I so don't do that. I think about God about once or twice a day. I've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of God working in us, or something. I try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. I just want to be me. God I know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. If I just let go a little, I can go a long way with YOU. But my gosh it's hard to let go. Let me see the ways I can let go. I'm going to go get something to eat for lunch. 
__label__label1 I am just not feeling too well today. I know I should not have gone out last night. I did anyway. I told myself that I could easily say "no" when asked to go out, but who was I kidding? I knew I would give in at some point. Anyway, I knew I would get sick because everyone else in my dorm has gotten sick. I knew my turn would have to come. I am very distressed right now. I have met so many people in the past ten days, and I cannot remember everyone's names. People tend to remember my name, though. It is easy to remember. PROPNAME. I would remember that too. That's my name, PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME. Wow, I guess I do kind of like my name! I never can really decide if it's a good name or not, but I think it is ok. "Ok," that's a very complex word; I just learned in my philosophy class about the term "ok. " I love my philosophy class; it's really interesting. I am about to go to my freshman seminar, which is entitled, "Success With Less Stress. " It's very interesting. I started reading the text yesterday, and it's awesome. It's seemed quite redundant at points, yet interesting overall. I love to write. I have been told that I am a very creative writer. I like that. I like being creative. I think it's interesting to be creative instead of always being precise and conservative. I forgot what I was about to say. I'm glad I can still type with a moderate speed. I would be screwed right now if I were a horrible typist. I am not all that great, but I am fairly quick. I love choosing words to write. I write differently than I speak, though. Sometimes I wish I were able to speak as creatively as I write. I have to admit, though, I do come up with some fun words. Fantabulous. I love that word. Absofuckinglutely. I love that one too. I only say that one on occasion, though. It sounds quite harsh coming from a girl. I try not to cuss a whole lot, but I can't help it sometimes. Like, when I'm around my girlfriends, I tend to cuss a whole lot more than when I'm around guys. I think girls sound trashy when they cuss constantly. I had NEVER said a cuss word in my whole life until I was about fourteen years old! Now, I've gotten a little too comfortable saying them. I even cuss when I'm around my mom, which doesn't make her too happy. She cusses on occasion around me too, though. Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. I met this guy named ORGNAME, and, I think he's a real cutie, but I've also met so many other people in the past weeks, and I like some of them, too. It's weird, thoughI was out last night at this Figi Pledge Line bullshit, and I met some real hotties, but I still thought about Cas; and, I even called him from the party. Weird, huh. I don't think he is the hottest guy, but he has the most awesome personality. I can't stand to talk to a guy, no matter how hot he is, if he doesn't know what to say to me. Cas is right on. He makes me smile and laugh all of the time. I like that. And, he likes me too. That's weird. I mean, not to be braggy, but I do get hit on quite a lot, but some guys obviously just don't like me once they get to know me, which is standard in most cases, but, Cas knows me. I am completely myself around him, and he still likes me. He told me he likes me. I told him that I am mad at myself for liking him  it was funny. I am straight forward with him. It's nice to be that way sometimesyou know, not hide anything. Some things I believe we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should not say  there are things we should keep to ourselves. I believe that we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should share most things. I just clearly contradicted myself, yet it makes since. I know most people think the same way. I am getting tired of typing. I feel drowsy, and my fucking head and throat hurt. I am going to work out anyway, though. I am addicted to working out. I love it and hate it at the same time. I usually dread actually getting up and going, yet I love sweating and the high I get from actually doing it. Ok, I have been writing the standard amount of time now, and I have another class in ten minutes. Bye. 
__label__label0 It is the first time that I have done this and I don't think it is at easy as it sounds. For though there are no mathematical equations to solve I do think it is pretty hard to keep on writing without stopping for such a great amount of time (00 minutes is a lot of time) I don't really know what to keep on writing, since right now I am just worried about the fact that this are going to be the longest 00 minutes of my life. I have just received and email of my cousin and I'm so glad because she is now working and it makes me think how great it would be for me to get a job, since today I went again, to speak to the person in charge in the cactus café and no one was there, and the girl told be that there were no open jobs and specially not at the time that I need. I really want to work because I don't want to spend more money given to me by my parents since I'm fully aware that they need it for things far more important that what I am using the money for (clothes, food, personal expenses in general. When the eternal 00 minutes go by I shall reply to my cousins email and express to her the great gratitude I feel towards her email since at the present time she has been one of the only people in my family, which have supported us in this time of nee. This is really hard for me because I feel like I'm writing like a two year old since this isn't my native language. It would be so much more comfortable if I could write in my language, since when my mind is working it is usually processing information in English. Right now the phone is ringing and I guess this is PROPNAME since he said he was going to call. I really hope its not anyone from home for I would be really disappointed and sad if they called and me being here did not pick up the phone just because I am doing this stupid homework which at the time seems pretty irrelevant, to what I am feeling at the present time. I am just repeating myself and a set of common American expressions that come to my mind, this is pretty stressing because I want to look at the monitor and check out how much have I written and specially I want to check out the timer. for I have taken a cooking timer to control my minutes typing so that I wouldn't have to stop to watch the clock. While typing other thoughts go past my mind but they are probably in Spanish and I am probably just ignoring them so that I don't make typos, this makes me think of my stupid physics teacher, I'm so glad I don't have to take any more physics in my whole life. I don't really know what I want to study, each time I go to the introduction to psychology class my mind plays tricks on me and I start visualizing myself in various occupations and I'm not quite sure of which one truly fits me. I couldn't resist so I took a look at the timer and I just realized that only ten minutes have passed and they have passed so slowly, its like when you are up at night not being able to sleep and scared of the dark and listening to the clicking of the clock and time just passes so slowly. Well I would just like to get it over with since I am basically trashing 00 minutes in front of this computer not doing any real thinking or insight process but just mechanically typing and typing and typing and when I make a mistake I just press the backspace and keep on going. Well since I don't know what else to say I'll keep on exploring my thoughts related to my future and my career. I think a really important issue is due to me, going to this jerk astronomer who separated my life into two: before and after I went. I am really worried of what he said dealing with marriage and divorce, it has always been a fear I have had and that day he just said it to me as if nothing was the matter. And of course something is the matter because once they tell you something like that you won't be able to forget it ever. Also what he said about me having problems with my baby like miscarriages or stuff well I think he shouldn't have said that either. I wish I could have entered the business school since I would be having a respectable title of a carrier but since I didn't then I just en up having all these classes, which I really enjoy but which are making me feel more confused. I really like the university and the classes and the teachers, but I haven't made many friends and although I know it has nothing to do with my self worth I do feel a little upset because I have been hirer for over three weeks and still I don't feel like I have a lot of friends. I just took a look at the watch and I think this is finally it! 
__label__label0 My thoughts and feelings at the moment reflect several important aspects of my life. Perhaps, one of the most recurring thoughts has been my progress with my academic success. I am worried and concerned with maintaining an above average status as a student. One other concern of mine relates to my commitment toward studying and learning. I fear that I will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home. Thus, most of the time I reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried. I feel in great anguish and perhaps, turmoil. I am also very concerned about the financial needs and requirements of college. Often, I feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents. This, in turn, causes much sadness for me. Although the social aspect of my life, at the moment, is not a significant matter, I still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that I left behind. I comprehend the fact that any transition in life accompanies great distress and agitation. However, I find myself more weary and temperamental than distressed or melancholy. At times, I feel as though I have not slept for days. I feel constantly fatigued. I have always realized that I worry to a great degree; and at times that my lifestyle has dramatically changed, this aspect of my personality has in turn worsened. I see myself literally concerned about every trivial matter in life. I worry a lot about my weight issues. Lately, I have noticed a dramatic change in my eating habits. Through the past year, I was able to lose a great amount of weight and maintain it. I was also able to control what I ate in addition to exercising a great deal. However, lately I have deviated from this habitual behavior. I have gained about 00 pounds. I feel greatly out of control. I do not even have the motivation to exercise. Often, I wake up in the morning and find myself critically loathing every aspect of my appearance. At school, I often compare myself with other females and feel greatly embarrassed. My parents and my acquaintances have at times mentioned that I look better now that I am not so underweight. However, I do not perceive or comprehend their point of view. As a result, I promise myself almost every day to lose all the unnecessary weight that I have gained. I even plan a strict diet for the next weeks. However, I never follow through the plan. Although this recurring thought is truly trivial in comparison with matters concerning my education, I still cannot rid myself of the compulsive need to restrict my diet and control my eating habit. I believe that there is great tension in my life at the moment. Perhaps, this is true for a lot of students that have began their first year of college experience. Regardless of my emotional well being at the time, I still seek hope and remedy in studying and experiencing all the knowledge that college has to offer. I am sure that if I put enough effort into my academic advancement I will easily succeed in future. Nevertheless, I truly wish that I could annihilate the worries that accompany me day and night. 
__label__label1 This is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever had to do. Usually we are always told almost exactly what to write, but I like the idea of doing this a lot more. I'm not too sure what you guys actually do with this things, but that's fine with me, because I'd much rather me doing this than writing some boring long paper. Today is a Friday, the second best day of the week. Thursday is the best, because my classes end at 00:00 and I only have one class on Fridays, so my weekend pretty much starts on Thursdays. College life is so much better than high school life. I love having all the freedom. The only part I would change is having someone making sure I get up in the morning for all my classes, I seem to be having problems with that, but I don't think it will happen anymore. I joined a fraternity, so I think that is helping making college more fun. Usually when most people think fraternity, they imagine the typical fraternity and everything that goes along with it, mainly the hazing. I joined PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and it is a national policy of theirs not to haze, so I have nothing to worry about. I've heard stories about other fraternities hazing already, and I don't understand what the point of it is. Completely stupid! Why would you want to put people through the different kinds of suffering if you're going to live with them for the next 0 years? Yes, I understand that it can build strong bonds between each pledge class, but it just means you are always going to hate the class above you that hazed you. Being in PROPNAME PROPNAME is incredibly awesome, I can't imagine me ever having any regrets. By joining my freshman year, it makes me feel more comfortable at LOCNAME than I think I would have been if I had not joined. I no longer think of myself as just another random person, or number, at UT, because I know belong to something. I'm just kind of rambling on here, not really being able to think of much to say. I'm wondering if these are going to be used as examples of things in class, or if they have some other purpose we are unaware of. I think I'll talk more about me, because I'm such a great topic(hint of sarcasm there). I feel incredibly comfortable with my life. I think I am extremely at ease in most situations, and I think I have a good grip on life. I've moved around a lot, so I think that has helped me. I was born in LOCNAME and lived there for two years, then I lived in LOCNAME for seven years, then LOCNAME for three years, then LOCNAME LOCNAME for a year, then I moved back to the same city in LOCNAME and lived there for almost five years, then three days before the start of my junior year in high school I moved to LOCNAME, where I graduated, but my family now lives in LOCNAME again. Being moved around a lot and thrown into new situations has probably made the transition from living at home to being at college a lot easier for me than for other people. When I moved before the start of my junior year, I absolutely hated my parents for taking me away from my friends, and my life, but now I think it has made me a better person because I seem to just go with the flow now and except everything as it happens. Alright, well time is up, so I'm going to go. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting all stressed out. For the first time since if got to UT I've had to study and do homework for a large period of time. I guess for the first time since I've gotten here I'm starting to realize how much work its going to take. The fraternity stage is getting old. They don't tell you that you are going to be busy about everyday of the week doing sometimes pointless stuff. I'm new to the fraternity scene and already I'm feeling somewhat burned out. And paying a lot of money to clean the frat bathrooms isn't my idea of fun anyway. Even drinking is getting old. Its almost to the point that you can expect to get messed up every night and that takes the fun out of the whole thing. I don't like admitting this to myself but it would be nice to see someone from the family right now. I'm not homesick just kind of feel like I'm missing out on everything that's going on in my brothers and parents life. It's hard to deal with the fact that the family life is never going to be the same again which is somewhat of a relief but also a little scary. At least I am enjoying living with my roommates. They were my friends before I came here but I am a bit surprised to how good we are getting along. With my friend dying last week I found myself today thinking I saw him in other people. The reality of death has hardly set in on me. His picture of him alive is hanging right in front of me, but its hard to comprehend there is no more life in him. I almost feel like all my experiences with him were pointless because he is dead. Even seeing him in an open casket I failed to connect him laying there to his death. I attribute this to the fact that this is the first person in my life that I was close to that has died. It's weird but it will help me in the future to deal with the harshness of death. More than ever I think along the lines of life after death. I'm firm in my beliefs regarding the subject but I somewhat question what its really like. I guess you never take death seriously until it effects you on the personal level. I hear of people dying everyday but it has never registered to me how important everyone's life his to someone else out there. And above all I guess the possibility of death seems more likely. I feel less likely to put myself in situations where my life is on the line. 
__label__label0 I am supposed to write for twenty minutes while I track my thoughts. I am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. It is 0:00, and unfortunately I have to miss my calculus discussion class at 0:00 due to a chemistry review for a test I have on Thursday, the 00th. PROPNAME, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group ORGNAME, is actually playing on my computer while I write this. I am also ripping one ORGNAME my compact discs via my computer so I can listen to it while not actually having the CD in the ROM drive. Sometimes I like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. It is absolutely incredible. In junior high school, I had no idea what the Internet was, nevertheless how to use it. Now, I sit at my computer and I will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. How does the information get to the desired location? I suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 0s using the binary number system. Still, the entire concept is simply amazing. What is in store for technology in the future? Hover cars? Now there is a concept. I come from LOCNAME, which is not only the most polluted city in the LOCNAME LOCNAME but also has a mighty big traffic problem. I think I will switch my music to PROPNAME. There we go. Anyway, with the help of cars that "float" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. However, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. Now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. This would definitely cause some major problems. Maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. The song has now switched to PROPNAME's LOCNAME. My friend PROPNAME has the score to this piece at his dorm at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because he is a music major. A bunch of my friends and I are going to see the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert in LOCNAME in a couple of days. I have seen the ORGNAME perform two previous times at the LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they were incredible. However, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. They will be coming out with a new album very soon, so I assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. Well, twenty minutes has just expired, so I will sign off now. 
__label__label0 why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of "natural" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a "serious" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. 
__label__label0 As I write my first writing assignment, I can't help but notice the time: 0:00pm. As usual, my radio is on. It only takes away the silence in my apartment. Blank. My head is blank. Empty. With nothing to say or write about. This has never been a problem before. In high school, there was never silence. Maybe I was always too busy to hear the silence. Now, it's a part of my life. At certain times last year, I could hear it. Weird, seeing how it was my freshman year in college. This year is my second year and I seem to hear nothing but silence. I am still involved in the same activities as last year. Perhaps, it's a sign that I'm finally growing up. Another weird concept. I am thinking that I like silence. Deep down, I do believe that I am a loner. In high school, who would have thought? A loner should be lonely, right? But I am not lonely nor am I ever bored. I like to do things by myself. I think that's it. I don't need anyone. I don't need companionship nor do I need to be felt needed. Awww. to much of the word, "need". No more. I am happy. I am content. I am selfassured. I told my mom once that I was a loner, but I can't remember what she said. I don't think she even responded to me. Funny thing though. I know I want to be married someday. Now, how would a loner accomplish something like that? I socialize very little these days. My mind is always on school and my studies. I just want that medical acceptance letter in my hands. That is all that counts. Well, not all. My family counts too. They mean more to me than anything. My little brother is here at LOCNAME. (he's no longer little anymore) I'm hoping he enjoys his first year. I know I did. So many memories to reminisce. Time: 0:00pm. My goal this semester is: 0. 0 ORGNAME. I really need to bring up my ORGNAME from first year. And my goal next semester is: 0. 0 GPA. My uncle always says, hard work will always be paid off in the end. Consistency + Confidence = Success. 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I know I can do it. I hope I won't be behind in my classes. Especially in that chem. Class. It seems like a really hard class. I can feel those late nighters already. Time: 0:00pm. 
__label__label1 Right now I feel like there must be something more important that I could be doing. That's not to say that what I'm doing right now is unimportant, but I feel that there is something more imperative looming. I feel like I need to clean my room because all of my clutter is getting annoying to look at. I feel like I brought to many things with me to college in order to ensure my comfort, but all these things are only making me more uncomfortable by their presence. Tomorrow I have a test in chemistry that I think is going to be really easy. Hopefully it turns out as easy as I think it will. I don't really need any surprises right now. I wonder if the medication I'm taking for my earache is giving me all these rashes or if it's just the less than par level of cleanliness in the mighty LOCNAME LOCNAME. I heard that it's dirtier than LOCNAME LOCNAME but I'm beyond caring. Rat dander and roach feces don't bother me until I see them. The only thing that really nags me about my dorm room is the bed. Who knows what nasty things that old mattress harbors? If I was really anal retentive I wouldn't be able to sleep on it because of the thought of all the stuff that it has probably accumulated over the years, but instead I succumb to fatigue, grimace in disgust, and lay my head down once again. Speaking of which, my head itches. Rat dander, I tell you. In addition to my concern over the probable existence of rat dander is my concern over the obvious existence of dust. I have never seen quite so much dust. They told us that the air conditioning system wasn't working properly and that they were working on it. It appears to work just fine in regards to spewing dust all over my precious things that annoy me so much. I guess I'll just have to buy some eye drops to go along with the calamine lotion for all these rashes I've been getting. I got the last bottle at Jester store. It was sitting there sort of lonely like it didn't belong at all so I just grabbed it up. I scoff at the poor soul who doesn't develop rashes until a few days from now for he will be forced to go elsewhere for calamine. I think my leg rash might be flaring up again. That sucks. I wish I had absolutely nothing that I needed to do right now because then I could just sit in front of the tv watching a movie and scratching my leg. Now that's the life. Too bad I'm bogged down with college and all of this success waiting to happen to sit around and do nothing. And so ends my stream of consciousness as I am much too absorbed in my itchy leg to think any longer. Plus my 00 minutes is up. 
__label__label0 Ok, so I'm not really sure what I should write for twenty minutes because usually when I'm writing something or doing something I'm totally focused on it. So, I don't know if I can be focused on just straight writing for twenty minutes, but I'll give it a try. Right now, I also have the tv on, I like to do two things at once which sometimes is a fault of mine, because I can't fully concentrate on one thing. I don't like this show, I think I'll change the station. Well, it's been three minutes and I'm kind of of at a stopping point. "You're a god and I'm a god. cause you're a god and I am god and I just thought I'd let you go". I don't actually believe that, but right now that music video is on the radio. When I don't have anything else to think about I tend to sing to myself. I really enjoy singing, but I know it's something in which I'm not that talented at. I'm better than average, but I'll never have my own record. I don't know how people just sit and write what ever is going on in their heads, I mean I tend to think a lot, but I find that I don't think about serious deep stuff. I just think about like what I'm going to have for lunch. I hate this song, stupid Nine days and Story of a Girl. I think it's stupid that PROPNAME PROPNAME is coming out with Spanish language Cd. She doesn't even speak Spanish. Just Hispanic because Latino music is really popular she thinks that she can put out a Spanish CD. But I guess the same thing could be said about NSYNC, They aren't even Hispanic. But it's ok, because "This I Promise You" is a really good song. Ummm. just 00 more minutes to go. I want some skittles. I don't like those man's sunglasses. I wonder if this has to grammatically correct and spelling correct. I'm such a bad speller. Is it possible to really not be thinking. Like I was just staring at the tv, but I don't' think I was really thinking. I wasn't concentrating on the tv, but I wasn't thinking of anything else I'm hungry. I wish PROPNAME didn't have a 000 class. I don't care for eating real late, I'd prefer to eat early, but it's ok, because she's my friend. I like the new ORGNAME song, but he makes me mad. I can understand that he doesn't want to be bothered by people, but that is the price for fame. I feel sad for his daughter, because her dad has some much repressed anger and the life he lives is probably hard on her. I mean having her mother go insane and then having her parents divorce at such a young age, she only looks 0 or 0, will be real hard on her. This is a really long song. I wonder what it's like to just be falling, to not be sure if you're going to be alive after the fall. Does it fell free or is this impending fear of life being over. Does your life really flash before your eyes? And what does it feel like when you finally do fall? I think I'm watching too much tv. As of now, I'm listening to another song, but I don't think that I can type the words as fast as I sing them. But the song is Kryptonite bye 0 doors down. Well, I guess that's it. It's been 00 minutes and I think I've run out of things to say/ think. 
__label__label1 I remember when asked to do this assignment, I was wondering if someone would actually really want to know my thoughts. I find it kind of hard to just type out all of my thoughts, considering that there are hundreds of random thoughts every minute(or it seems). Phones ringing. cell phones. yuck. Interruptions. I knew that would happen. I don't think I'm capable of having twenty minutes of silence to type something. All I know is that I am really really hot which will probably affect my thinking. I'm naturally a "hot natured" person, and my sister's room is really hot. So hot I'm sitting here sweating and I'm barely moving my body. My room is just as hot though. I'm just hot all the time. I wonder what affects it really does have on me. I know it makes me grumpy sometimes. Especially if I'm hungry at the same time. That's just a bad position to be in hot, sweaty, and hungry. No matter how low I turn are air conditioner, I'm still burning hot. Not to mention our electricity bill that makes me just as hot! But I guess I don't have any room to complain. I couldn't ask for anything more in my life. I have everything I've ever wanted and more! I accidentally meet my boyfriend and he just makes everything even better than it was. He makes me see things that I would have never seen before. He really has made a difference in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you God. I wonder how my mom is feeling? Her surgery was last week, so I'm sure she doesn't feel as bad as she did. Since she was at work a couple days later, I guess she must not have felt too bad. But she is a strong woman the strongest woman I've ever known. I'm proud to say that. Very proud. I guess you kind of' start missing your parents when you leave for college and you're far from home. But I am lucky to have an older sister(who I live with) and I've always gotten to follow behind her, making her do everything first. That's made my life a heck of a lot easier. I do miss my bed and my dogs. Not to mention my home. But I'll be going home soon, so I'm ready to go. I'm ready to introduce my boyfriend to my parents and grandmother too. That should be fun! I know it will go well though. I also wonder if my sister's car will be out of the shop, because I wanted to leave earlier than my sister. She won't get out of class until 0pm and I was wanting to leave around noon. It just takes so long to get there. PROPNAME wanted to ride with my dad when he goes on duty too. I guess I'll leave around noon anyway and not go into work. Ohwell. I'm broke as it is. Why not add to that?!? A couple hours of missed work won't hurt to badly. I do need the money though. I'm going to be eating well that weekend anyway. I'll have 0 meals a day! That's more than I can say now and the food I'll get there is a million times better then what I would have here. You really start to miss the little things about life sometimes it just takes leaving your home for a couple months to do that to you. Years. it's going to' be hard to be away for that long. But I guess it kind of grows on you after a while and you just don't realize or notice it. Hmm I wonder how long I've been typing. I have a lot to read. 
__label__label1 I am so glad that I got some emails today. I love when people write me, and tell me what is going on in their life. It also makes me feel good when they ask me to do things with them. I really have a lot to do today. My bulletin board is just so plain. I have to get some color back up there, to make the room appear pretty. I love LOCNAME football, I need to put my poster back up of the football team and schedule. I love the picture my friend sent me in the mail, now I can look at it everyday on my magnetic board. I wonder if my roommate will come back after her class, so we can go eat lunch. I am really hungry. I wonder what they are having for lunch. I need to go check my mail, to see if I got a letter from the company I applied for work. I really hope I get that job, it would be so fun, and I would have some extra spending money. All of these wires on my desk are driving me up the wall. I need to see if I can hide them some way. I need to hook my printer up before I hide all of the wires. People come in and out of this dorm all day long. It is funny all the different schedules people have. I wonder if that screeching noise outside ended up in a wreck. Austin traffic really scares me. People just don't care when they are driving. I have to be the observant one, when I drive tonight. These pigeons outside my window are really getting on my nerves. I hate that purring noise they make. How do they even make that noise? They are such big and ugly birds. Somebody must be taking a shower, because the water is running in the bathroom. What could be making that squeaky noise I hear, it is about every minute. Dorms have all kind of noises. I really like my dorm now, I just need to finish decorating it, since I had to take it down for the sprinkler installation. I worked so hard getting my bulletin board perfect, then I had to rip it down. Now I have the task of putting it all back up, like I had it. I can't wait until I have it back like I had it because the room was just so bright and vibrant, with posters and fabric. I wonder if my theatre teacher will discuss that play we went to see last night. I can't believe he went to the same one. I think it was a little too different for me. I am not really into plays that much, so can I grasp the plot of this one, in order to write a critique? I bet he will say something about it today in class. I can not wait to hear what he has to say. I love that class, it is so much fun. He is so energetic, I look forward to it each day I get to go. I wonder if I will see PROPNAME today. I hope I get to talk to her, she is a nice person. I am getting kind of worried about my roommate, she is not back yet. I really want to go to lunch. I wish the sprinkler installation would be over, because I can't take much more of this drilling. I don't understand why it sounds so close, I thought they were finished with the rooms around us. Maybe these walls are just really thin. I like wearing a hat, I think I will do it more often. I didn't have to fix my hair, it was great. The bells are chiming, I love that sound. Look it is over time to stop. I wonder if I am supposed to end this in a specific way. Oh well, I don't know what to do. This was interesting. 
__label__label1 My life is an out of control freight train. I know not where I am going or how I am going to get there. Throw a match upon me and I could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. But for what reason do you do this? I hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that I pass the question. Why am I all of the sudden asking myself why? I know where I came from but does this mean I cannot know where I am going? On I travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. This gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. This is why I am grateful that I do not have to face the world alone. My life is full of love and hope. My hopes of myself are to touch some person the way I have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. This ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and I can see through your blurry sight. And I can see through you! Your rules mean nothing to me and mine. I live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. I draw so much upon my music that I sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. My life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings. 
__label__label1 I wonder if I can make it to the SZB building in 00 minutes. Also, do I need to look at the map again? Probably so. I can't remember what room it is in. I think I'll have time for a nap this afternoon. It is definitely much needed; I just hope I can squeeze it in. It's a good thing I only have one class today. I hope the TA doesn't ask as many questions as he did last week. I think all of our brains are a bit numb. Wow. It's only been 0 minutes. This is going to be a long paper. I'm pleased that my parents are being more considerate of the apartment situation. They have to stop procrastinating and realize that this is the best thing to do in this situation. The cost of living in LOCNAME is absurd and so is the demand for living. Gosh. I just moved into ORGNAME and I already have to look for next year. I just hope I don't flunk out or else there goes half of the money! Maybe PROPNAME's dad talked to her and settled whatever worries she and my dad had. If he was worried about me handling the details with the realtor, he could have talked to him, but he refused. Ugh, like life couldn't be more difficult. Who needs their parents telling them what to do once they have gotten to college. It's my time now and they need to respect that. It's just too hard, I guess. All they ask about is school, grades, sometimes health, and sleep. They have to realize college isn't easy in any aspect, including the financial one. Oh, well, I guess they'll learn. I'm wondering when my dad is going to decide to send my computer here. Oops, that's right. I shouldn't expect it anytime soon since he procrastinates on everything. I feel so bad for having to use PROPNAME's computer all the time. I wonder what's for lunch today. I bet it's good. It's always good. I love SRD food and the waiters. I'm so happy to be living with PROPNAME and PROPNAME next year. I don't know PROPNAME too well, though. She seems nice, but I'm just saying that to be nice. I guess she's ok. She isn't the sort of person I would typically hang around with. She's also a neat freak and doesn't like cats. That's two hits against her. The funny thing is, the rest of us are messy, so I don't know who is going to share the room with her. I'm also very excited about the hamster. It will be so much fun to have a little apartment pet. I wonder what we'll name it. I hope my sister learns a lot at the convention this weekend. We all know she needs all the leadership skills she can handle! I wonder if PROPNAME is coming straight home from school. If so, she should be here pretty soon. I am so excited about PROPNAME's birthday present. I hope everything works out and PROPNAME and I can go to LOCNAME and use her RF something equipment. I love being creative and doing fun, meaningful things like that! Oh, my gosh, the 00's prom tonight is going to be so much fun! It'll be awesome to see everyone dressed up. That's a hard theme for guys to follow, though. I wouldn't know what to do if I was one of them. I hope PROPNAME turns out to be cute. I heard he's really sweet. People usually say that if someone isn't that good looking. Oh, well, if I survived a night with PROPNAME, I can definitely survive an 00's prom with PROPNAME. I wonder which ORGNAME knows me. Or, like PROPNAME said, he could've just been saying that. Either way it was very nice. I wonder what possessed PROPNAME to set me up with this guy. I've never been on a blind date before and the suspense is wonderful. I hope all this nasty drainage stuff is just allergies. I think it is. Everyone's allergies seem to be killing them right now. Ha. That was so funny that we saw PROPNAME PROPNAME at PROPNAME in the Box last night. It's deja vu. Wow that was neat how those little things popped up over the deja vu words. Wow, it did it again. I hope it is warm enough to go floating down the river this weekend. My mom said a cool front was supposed to move in. I hope not. Can't it wait another day? It'll be fun camping in tents. I've never really roughed it before. I better take my umbrella to school with me. It looks like it is about to rain. Oh, I also need to catch up on emails this afternoon. So much to do, so little time. PROPNAME, my time is up. 
__label__label0 Today has been one of the longest days of my life. I have had only one class today so I am constantly looking for some way to spend my time. It seems that everyone I know here on campus is in class or at work, therefore I am left alone with nothing to do. When I sit there with nothing to do I become very homesick. If it were not for my Friday classes I would be long gone. It excites me however, that tomorrow I get to go home. I can't wait to be in my own house without a roommate or doors slamming through the night. One thing that I can't wait to see is my cousins. They are adorable. The oldest, LOCNAME, is like the sister I never had despite the fact that she is only nine years old. I enjoy being around her ORGNAME it makes me proud when she comes to me to ask personal questions. I have three other cousins too. PROPNAME, who is five, is so cute and has such a wild imagination. It excites me to watch her imagination at work. She is one of the very few children left in this world that can entertain herself for hours with a paper towel roll. Next is Will, the little man. He is only two and is constantly making me laugh. He is in love with ORGNAME ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. He knows every word to the songs and has his own little dance for each of them too. The youngest, and I have to say my favorite, is little Miss PROPNAME PROPNAME. She turned one on August 00. The reason that I think I like her the most or think about her the most is the fact that we almost lost her. She was born with the strep virus in her lungs and spent the first month of her life in the ICU on a lung machine. She is now a healthy little girl. She is now walking but it seems so weird to see her walk because she is only the size of a 0 month old. She is so tiny. I can't wait to see them. They are the world to me and I love them and miss them everyday. Just as I do my parents and my brother. That is on thing that gets me down about college. I don't like being away from my family. I love them dearly. They mean everything to me. Writing this paper has depressed me but I know that tomorrow I will get to see them all and spend the entire weekend with them. Yeah! My brother is cool. I am one of the very few girls in this world that got blessed with an awesome older brother. He is three years older than me and he has always been there for me, much like my two loving parents. I thank God everyday for the family that he has given me and the support he has surrounded me with. 
__label__label0 I am not sure if I am studying properly. Doing this makes me very nervous. I wish she would call me but I know it is hard. Sometimes it really sucks being in love. especially with someone my parents don't approve of. I wish I could escape sometimesto a place where no one judges anyone and everyone gets along and dad's don't drink. Where one can hear the sun rise and set; where stress is nonexistent and there's never any need to cry. I love to write, but not today. I want to sit in a tree and observe. Nobody would know I was there. Why are people so oblivious? We're really quite stupid. We hurt people and they hurt us. Nobody really wants to be hurt. My arms hurt. I really want to make this rowing team. I have to be part of something. I have been for 00 years. Why doesn't she come visit me. She is my backbonemy strengthI need her. I want to run away TO LOCNAME. That would be so great. LOCNAME is beautiful, peaceful and usually stays out of the limelight. Privacy. That would be so nice. She and I get along really well but it would be nice if I could have a little privacy every now and then. Well, a couple of days would be nice. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. about anything. I don't know who to talk to. I feel tired and unkempta lot. I wonder why. I love college though. I hated high school because I felt as if it were not to my level. Here there is a challenge. Flag football Wed. 00th. Today ultimate Frisbee. TomorrowApril. Test 00th speech. That mouse pad is black. Why am I dizzy sometimes. I need to write. Seriously write. Like I used to. It always made me feel so much better. and my teachers loved it. What on earth is this chick next to me doing? I really HATE it when people look at my monitor when I am trying to do this. PET PEAVE. Or when there are like 000 computers open and she has to come sit right next to ME. I like lightning. It's so beautiful. I like rain. I want to go play in it. I don't ever want to grow up. I hope this phone doesn't get me in trouble. I really need to get my computer fixed. It's so dead. So am I. But not too bad. Not as bad as I have been. I really have a lot of questions about God. I really need to get them answered because all of it is driving me absolutely out of my mind. Maybe I'll hang around after church on Sunday. ask the pastor. Maybe not. I hope my mother is happy with him. She deserves to be happy after everything she's been through. I'm glad they found each other again. I need to workout. It keeps me strong and in shape. April needs to be happy. She tries so hard to make me happy but I don't want her to. She needs to make herself happy. PROPNAME needs to lay off. I need to go home. 
__label__label1 I've never done this before, but hey, whatever. College is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments I've had to do so far for classes. I don't really know what to say. I just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss her. And borrowing her clothes. I miss my little sister, too. It's funny because I didn't think I'd really miss my family and most of the time I don't, but the other night I just got this sporadic mental picture of my Dad. It was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. It sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. Such is growing up. So, no one's going to read this. That's pretty good because I'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. I love that word. I try and use it whenever I can. Ha! This is crazy. Actually, PROPNAME's class is one of the best I have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. I only took it because this girl I know said she knew PROPNAME's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. And he is. And he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. I mean, some of my professors are crazy. I have this one professor who barely speaks English, which is cool and all, but really, how can I learn from someone I can't understand? And the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, "In LOCNAME. " At least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and I've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. I don't get it. Does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in LOCNAME? Because that's what we're studying right now. Bacteria. And it's not even interesting. I mean, who really cares about ERs and lipids and lysosomes? Well, I guess that's a pretty dumb question. Of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. I personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. Really, guy. But I have to take the class, whether I want to or not. I only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, I'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. Ah, geology. My eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. After this, I have some serious catching up to do. And it's not because I miss my classes or anything. I mean, I don't even drink. Except for wine, and that's really only when I eat out, which I do less and less these days. These dayswhat am I talking about?! I've been here for less than a month. It feels like I've always been here, though. Which is weird. I love LOCNAME, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. Seriously, they're nasty. And what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? They're not, most of them anyway. My neck hurts. That professor I was talking about earlier, the one who speaks English very poorly? He sings in class. Right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. And it's not like he's singing to himself. I mean, he's wearing a mike. We can all hear him loud and clear. And the only song he knows how to sing is "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning. " Except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. He's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. Anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, I would never go to class. That's pretty weird of me, right? 
__label__label0 Well, this is interesting, writing for 00 minutes straight, I don't know if I've ever written for that long continuously before, this should be a welcome challenge. My roommate is bustling around the room, packing for retreat, and he forgot to do this assignment, he's running around the room packing and trying to do this assignment, haha, it's kind of funny. sucks for him that he forgot about this, he's going on a campus crusade trip this weekend, so I have the entire room to myself, wonder what things I can do with that luxury, hmmmm, time to ponder what interesting things can happen this weekend. Cosby show is on, I'm waiting to watch my favorite cartoon at 0 o'clock, dragon ball z. Japanese animation at it's best. I think I just have a thing for fighting and energy balls flying through the air and planets being blown up. I guess I'm just like a stereotypical guy. I'M football starts this weekend. I'm pretty excited. I signed up through ORGNAME. known as chinese bible study. should be fun since I get to meet some new people considering I came from a pretty strong contingent of people I already knew from the LOCNAME area, mainly centered around plano. LOCNAME is a really cool place. more things to do then in plano. but. not having a car kind of sucks. can't just go wherever. unless I feel like walking. which doesn't happen very often. only thing that is troubling is the weather. so freaking hot and humid and. just. nasty. can't wait until fall and winter when it's nice and cool outside with some rain and some mist. that'd be nice. none of this 000 degree weather. for a few months at least. Just got done with classes today. chemistry. right now it's pretty much a review of chemistry I I took in high school. so. not too troublesome yet. but the teacher is pretty good. she's really into the chemistry and lectures well even though most of the people already know how to do everything from high school. but it's nice to see the drive she has to teach and get the information through to us. my roommate just stocked up on food. he made a pilgrimage to the ORGNAME because he's lucky and didn't have a class today. no class at all. what a punk. well. I shouldn't complain. I have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. that's pretty nice. it's just calculus discussion too. so. I can get away with like. dozing off in that class. I'm going to lake travis this weekend with some friends. that should be pretty fun. get away from the city for a bit. and. get nice a dark. hope I don't get burned. and. don't want to turn the color of burnt toast either. I will no longer look chine se. hmmm. should I get a hair cut this weekend? I'm thinking about changing my hair. want to cut it shorter. because. it's nice and hot around here in Austin. shorter hair would be nice. considering I do walk everywhere for now. hmmm. provocative. maybe I'll ask some people what they think. then I can trek down to the drag and find a place to get my hair chopped. or. ear's lowered. whatever is the lingo nowadays. I have a lot of reading to do this weekend. what a bummer. I have to read the 0 books out of the odyssey for Greek. and I have a quiz on Monday. I have to read chemistry and start the hw. I have some calc hw I should do. and. need to read for psych. what a weekend. tons and tons of reading. but. football on Sunday. get to watch some ORGNAME and get to see how well my fantasy players do. hopefully I'll win in fantasy football this week. lost last week. kind of made me mad. my team didn't produce. but it happens. hmmm. hope I get to play basketball this weekend too. haven't played in a few days. and didn't play as much as usual this week. wonder if my skills have deteriorated. guess it'd be a good time to find out. just play some pick up game against some friends. hopefully I'll get to dominate. but. in all likeliness. I'll be toasted. nicely toasted. oh well. it happens. I'm really tired right now. I should have slept earlier. I don't know though. I slept around 00:00. I should be okay. that's 0 hours. maybe it was because my roommate was snoring so I couldn't get any sleep. kept waking up in the middle of the night to that hideous sound. that'll keep you awake. but once I hit him. he shut up. should keep that in mind more often. hehehe. hmmm. I'm trying to submit this. because I've written for more then 00 minutes. but I can't. hopefully I'll be able to turn this in on time. I only have an hour and a half to turn this in. well. hopefully all will work out for the good. 
__label__label0 wow! I'm not much on typing for 00 minutes, but I love to write emails to my friends. so I guess that that counts. I miss them so much, they are my friends from camp. I get to see them this weekend, and I cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, I guess that I just need to say something to her, cause I'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, I know that she doesn't. I hope that I can fit everything into my schedule that I need to, cause I have a lot on my "to do list". haha, I'll try! that's all I can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that I thought would be less than it is. I mean, I thought that I was pretty responsible, but I'm guessing that now I'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, I'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. I miss them. but that's ok, cause I have so many new friends down here that I don't know what to think. I've had some dates, but nothing GREAT and way exciting so far. I guess that I'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe God will just bless me w/ some amazing guy while I'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause I have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 0 people just walked in my door. I need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, I do. I wish that I could control how much I eat, well, I guess that if I keep on telling myself that, then I need to take some action. well, self, listen. I hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. I need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. I really like my room, I think that it reflects my personality. I change my thoughts a lot. I expected that when I would write this, that I might just write about one thing, but I keep thinking about a lot of things. I guess that I didn't think about it too much, cause I get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but I like her. haha, weird for a girl, but I love to dance and sing. I think that she's talented. I hope that I don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause I haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates. I love to talk to people, they make me happy. well, yea, I really like to talk to people and get to know them. its so much fun. I feel that I'm rambling about absolutely nothing. I wish that I could see the stars here in LOCNAME. but I love when I get to get away cause that's one of my favorite things to do. maybe I'll get a chance to this weekend when I go to a&m. I love how people tell me that they are praying for me. cause I know that pray works. GOD IS THE DEAL! yea pray makes me happy too. being happy can keep anyone going in life. different things make different people happy. I like to find that out about people. God fills me w/ my joy! I really like typing this cause it makes me think about what I am really about. I feel guilty when I make some smart remarks and then I cussed today. which, I never do. that just makes me feel like a piece of junk. ok, I have to go, byebye. :) 
__label__label0 Wow. I have a lot of books. Ok, it's about 00:00. I tried to start this thing a while ago, around 0, but my girlfriend is over, and I'm helping her learn German. I've had a lot of German classes. Anyway, I'm going to marry her. Sometimes I'm afraid of the commitment, and the choice, but every time I'm with her, she makes me feel confident. When we go play tennis, study (as we are doing right now), or just about anything really. Hmm. PROPNAME got the job at the ORGNAME. I don't know if PROPNAME is just putting on a kind facade or what. SO many guys are like that. Maybe females, but I never really know. But guys are. They are great and pleasant until they're in the company of other men. Wasn't that a movie? In the Company of Men. Yes. Had a yellow and red cover to it, I think. Speaking of which, I need to watch those videos from Vulcan. What a great place. Cheap too. No quite as cheap as my dad's though. I wonder what RPM is going to be like when the evil giant faceless megacorporation finally gets its butt in gear. It seems like I've spent my entire life fighting against corporate america. Fuck Blockbuster, fuck ORGNAME. But now that they have bought out RPM Records. well, I'm glad my dad can retire in ease with all that dough. But I feel like I've betrayed myself. How can I be so gleeful about it? Sure, RPM fought the system, and won. we never went out of business. Several times, the megacorporations had to buy us out, not boot us out. But it's kind of like becoming a traitor for some quick cash. Like PROPNAME. That was one hell of a Judas Kiss. $000,000. Wow. Anyway, I really hope my semester pans out well. I'm really liking the idea of the English Teacher class I'm taking. THe teacher seems friendly. Reminds me a lot of Mrs. PROPNAME. And what luck, a german in there too! Woher aus Deutschland kommst du, mein neue PROPNAME? I think it will be exciting to get to practice my german. THat reminds me, I need to go drop that GER 000 class I'm taking. I don't think I'll really like it. And I can get enough practice helping PROPNAME anyway. I wonder what I should add. So much is riding on these up coming semesters. Did I mention I love my baby? I'm going to propose to her sometime in October. On a hot air balloon, with a large banner on the ground that says, "Will You Marry Me?" I think it will be great. So romantic. Except for the balloon operator. PROPNAME has low self esteem though, at least when it comes to academia. She's so smart, but she just needs to practice. At whatever. SHe's goofy too. So much fun. I'm actually getting a bit tired. I've been writing for about ten minutes now. I think I want another drink. That crangrape juice was good. Hmm. Sleep would be good. Tennis would too. I think I'm too tired for tennis tonight. I may fall asleep during the movie. Studying and writing is tiring. I don't miss home. PROPNAME, that is. Austin is great. So much better than that rotten place. Everyone there, my age at least, had one single goal: undermine everyone else. Ugh. It's been 00 minutes. Bye. 
__label__label0 Sometimes I think that maybe I need to make some changes to my life. Almost everyone I meet in my life think I'm too shy or too quiet. Personally I think I just don't like to talk. I tend to stand aside and listen or observe what is being discussed. Sometimes those who don't know me well get the wrong idea that I don't like talking to them. A lot of my good friends from high school think that I've changed since I came to college. They say I've learned to open up more to people. I think I'm still the same person though. I guess when a person moves into a college environment it's kind of hard not to talk to people. I mean we're always meeting so many people everyday. I guess another thing I feel like I need to change is my stress level. I tend to stress out very easily. Anything from school problems to things happening at home could make me nervous. I always feel so tense. It's as if everything is going by so fast and I don't have enough time to complete everything I need to do at once. When I'm around my family I usually try not to show them how stressed I am. However when I'm with my friends it's pretty obvious if I'm stressed out. I become moody easily and don't have an appetite. The last two years of college were stressful for me. I didn't know what I wanted to do in my life. I felt that everyone around me had a plan or goal they were working towards. For me, I couldn't find what I really liked. I tried talking to different people but it never really helped. Actually the main problem was myself. I'm always so indecisive. If someone was to ask me to choose between two things, I wouldn't know which one to choose from because I felt both were equally good or bad. 
__label__label1 Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 000 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 00 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a "woman thing. " I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With PROPNAME, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 0 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 00 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 00 pills a day now. I was taking about 00. PROPNAME said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care! 
__label__label0 I'm sitting here listening to a trance cd of jimmy van M who I recently saw at LOCNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. As best as I can express my sensations and reactions to this music something will always be left unsaid. The music is a magical, emotional journey that not many people understand. Those that do, however, are purveyors of another plain of consciousness that will forever stay with them. A grammatical explanation is hard to find when most people are entirely withheld from experiences that have the guaranteed potential to alter people's lives. I often think of PROPNAME PROPNAME's idea. "Far better it is to dare mighty things than to take rank with those poor timid spirits who know neither victory or defeat. " I for one am a great example of the power that is contained in some of the things I've experienced. I wish I could really delve into these things sometimes without hesitating with regards to the repercussions. But, then again, the leap of faith is something everyone must do on their own. Someone can only be shown the door. You must have the initiative within to step across it on your own. As much as I've seen and endured I sometimes wonder if I really have seen everything that is the best. Then I remember what I thought before my experiences and I know that there is still so much more out there for me to jump on. Avoiding selfdestruction is also a daunting task sometimes and an everpresent one. One I am no longer fearful of fulfilling. Life really is too short to worry a fraction as much as most people do. This is a cold, hard fact. I'll be damned if I'll be lying on my deathbed reminiscing about all the missed opportunities. I'll croak knowing that I choked everything out of life and then some, and then a little more. 
__label__label0 What should I write about?. Anything that pops into my head? Okay. Well, I have to write PROPNAME email and via snail mail. I told him I'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was one fun and exciting weekend. I miss him so much. I think of him as much as I do about PROPNAME. But PROPNAME more so, of course. I can't wait to see PROPNAME again. Mom's cooking really smells good. She's cooking Filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. The watercolor picture on the front cover of the PSYCHO text is quite unusual. Looks like one of PROPNAME's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. Hmmmm. how much more time do I have? Eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. I keep thinking about ORGNAME and the internet. I have to catch up with my email writing and AFLS posts. I rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. There are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. PROPNAME posts there, though. That's really nice of her. Very thoughtful lady. But what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. They probably know more about PROPNAME than they do about themselves. They're so obsessed. I just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but I'm not that type of person. I like writing this way. It's like a diary or a journal of some sort. I should do this more often. It's quite relaxing. I used to keep a diary. I'd tell it everything, especially how I felt about PROPNAME when I was younger. about 00 or 00 years old or so. I had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. He liked me, too, big time. It was only a few weeks ago, when I saw him after 00 years that I confessed. We were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. It felt so natural  he said so himself. I could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. And we shared so many common interests that I never knew we had before. My, what a story we have. It's like a long lost love affair. This writing assignment is pretty neato. Just writing down thoughts. Putting it into words. I could write a whole novel. HAHA! I'm still thinking of PROPNAME. But, alas, I am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. I didn't really know him back when I was 00 years old. His family, yes, but not him. It's only during high school that I got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. It wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in PROPNAME's case. I eventually fell for PROPNAME and I will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as I shall live. Should I end here? I've got one more minute. Well, it's at least 00 minutes, but I feel like writing more. My mom's cooking smells great. Well, time's up but I'll keep on writing. I need to go to the bathroom, too. So, until next time. This is confidential right? Now, where's that submit button? 
__label__label0 well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 0 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 0 weeks now. it feels like 0 months everything is moving by so slow I miss LOCNAME I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 0 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 00 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 0 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 0 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 0 hours actually now 0 0/0 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in LOCNAME I'm kind of homesick. I miss the simple life I lead when I was in LOCNAME everything has changed things are not so simple anymore I fell as though I'm not as happy here I don't know why though. don't worry. I'm not suicidal or anything I just wish I knew what was bugging me I think. actually I hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends I have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class I think ill have to make friends in there soon I feel stress stress from the world everything I hate it I get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. I have to stay awake. I'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. I need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense I like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 00 minutes 00 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye. 
__label__label1 Well, lets see, I'm writing for about thirty minutes here in my dorm room and well, I'm actually not sure what to write about. I guess since you are going to read this a little I should just tell you about myself. My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am a freshman here at LOCNAME. I am originally from LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME, but I am rather familiar with the city of LOCNAME already because my brother has been coming here for the past four years. I am in the Longhorn Marching Band and I play the TUBA! Besides your class I'm taking astronomy, philosophy, and a freshman seminar. What I really like about the University is that I get to meet all sorts of people. I've even made a new friend here in your own class. Her name is PROPNAME and I think she might become one of my friends by the time the year is over. But I've learned over the years that whether it happens or not is not the most important thing. Life will go on either way, whether we're friends, whether I pass your class, or even whether I decide to just sit at home and do nothing. That's the beauty of life. But it could also been since as the travesty of it as well. I consider myself to be a rather enlightened individual and so I have a rather morphed way of seeing things. I am my own island of tranquility in this sea of chaos. But chaos can be beautiful as well. Umm, its only been like six minutes so far so I don't know what else to write. I guess I could just type the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, just to improve my typing skills. Improvement is always a good thing. I believe that people are too preoccupied with the accumulation of material things. And that the only way to deal with this would be to take away all material things. Like people are not humble and they should be. I'm still in the process of finding ways to implement this idea, but most of these are still on the drawing board. Like if someone created free energy and just gave it out to everyone, I belief that that might completely destroy the economy and that would be good. Money serves no purpose but to bind us to our material things. Or, on a more serious note, what I think the people of the world need is some lifealtering event. Perhaps WWIII would suffice. That way everything and everyone would be dead and the few survivors would have to band together and realize that there is more to life than what we have now. There should be no prejudice or racism. Only on what people think should people be criticized, not on what they look like. That it shouldn't matter on their appearance but on the quality of their thoughts. Even that sounds a bit wrong to people but its just because most don't envision the same thing as me. Oh, well, whatever. These are just some random thoughts that I'm having. Take care and God bless. Bye. 
__label__label1 It seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and I lack control over when that thought surfaces. I have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, I need money. I can list what I need to do but once I get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. I can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. Well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, I think he's the one I'm going to marry. This relationship is just too good to ignore, so I wonder about him a lot. We have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. I've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and I noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. I still have a better work ethic than he does. But he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. I suppose also, I'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. I am a rather independent person. I don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and I don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but I rather spend a day locked in a 0 X 0 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. Now that is what I call companionship. I haven't had a best friend like him since I was 0. I don't think I would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 0 hours away. Another thing that concerns me is the way I have organized my higher education. I haven't really picked out a major, I'm not even on a reasonable track. I'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what I like to read about but I don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. I like math too, and I want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though I don't plan on majoring in any of those. My major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and English classes, and I absolutely hate English. I wanted to go to UT because I wanted to learn more. I like some of school in that I like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that I would have never thought existed. But the way UT works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. We are learning in order to work. Why can't we learn just to learn. Maybe I will be a social science major. 
__label__label1 Wow. what an assignment. I can barely type. I hope I will learn to write better. I keep listening to rosie on tv. A soda sounds good. I wonder when I will finally get mail. My parents were supposed to send me some stamps. I bet they got stolen. I wonder if avery will ever write to me. He says that he wrote me a letter like a week ago. Well were is it. I wonder if I will last for 00 minutes. I wonder what PROPNAME and mine relationship will be like while he is on his mission. I feel like a machine right now. I went to the health clinic. That was kind of weird but everyone was nice to me. It is so normal for someone to be sexually active. THey are so surprised to hear they you are a virgin. I was raised right and I actually learned what they taught. Some people have to learn the hard way at the expense of others. Abortion is the worst thing someone can just blow off. just because someone is being stupid and lustful they feel when they get pregnant that their mistakes should not come with the consequences. I wish I could watch PROPNAME of eat something instead of this. It is kind of fun though. I wonder if PROPNAME is coming down this weekend to visit me. My stupid computer will not ever work. My roommate is nice to let me borrow her computer. I wonder what mandy and PROPNAME are doing. I have a message from my sister. I think it is PROPNAME. She has been so helpful. I need to concentrate. I need to read my scriptures. How much longer do I have to write. My fingers are about to fall off. I keep making so many mistakes. AAAHHH! this is frustrating trying to keep up with my thoughts. This sure does help my writing speed. go girl go. I want to call sheila. I wonder if they are cooking or something. I already have a sandwich in the refrigerator from lunch. That is so stupid that they don't allow you to take food out of the cafe. I did. I paid for it. They just want to reap you off. Well I won't let them. I can't think I am thinking too hard. I wonder what avery is doing. I wish I could talk to him. It is driving me almost to the point of worry. I wonder if the mail is here yet. I am so glad this assignment is easy. I wonder what kind of awful things people write. I feel almost sorry for the professors that have to read this. I bet it will take forever. I wonder what kind of experiments I will participate in. My shoulder hurts. I wonder how often I will actually work out. I am so sore. How much longer. YEs 0 minutes. Praise the lord. I said a curse word today and I am not happy with myself. I don't want to get back into that habit. I am not a happy or truly happy person when I curse. It is not a nice thing to do. I wonder what the professors are thinking. I waited for the bus forever today. I thought I was going to die in this heat. My writing is getting worse. I am getting a headache. I wonder what it would be like to have a cat. I like twinkles but cats are so moody. I miss my dog PROPNAME. the cutest thing in the world. I wonder what they are doing at home. I wonder what they are eating. I am hungry. I miss eating with PROPNAME. will he ever write me. Is he too busy. I never heard of that. I am starting to get mad now. he was all worried about me dating other guys and he doesn't even take the effort to buy a stamp and mail it. I wonder if it got lost. I hope I get one soon. I am finally done. 
__label__label0 Hi, I will start ORGNAMEf by introducing myself. My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I am 00 years old and a second year student ORGNAME the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. I chose this time to talk because I have something very important on my mind. I met this girl about 0 months ago exactly, to this day at summer school (ACC), and we've been going out for about 0 month and 0/0 now. Within the last 0 weeks, I've been becoming very sad, and I think it may be due to our relationship. She does something that i've never had an exgirlfriend do before, and that is. she likes to "hangout" with her exboyfriend. It didn't bother me at first, I guess probably because we were just dating and not serious, but within the last month we became very serious and fell in love with each other. This is the first time i've ever been in love, by the way. I have become very jealous of this guy and sometimes even suspicious. I don't think I have suspicions of my girlfriend cheating on me, but that her exboyfriend will put a move on her, and she will realize she misses him and go back to him. I really don't know what to do. She promises me that they are just friends (you can tell we've talked about this a lot), and she does spend more time with me. Maybe i'm just insecure. I've never had a girlfriend stay loyal to me, and that's probably why I fear the same thing happening again. While i'm writing this paper she is with this guy. Let me tell you a story about what happened 0 days ago. It was a Saturday night, and I just got back to my dorm room from work around 0:00pm. At 0:00 pm, my girlfriend calls, and I ask her "What's up?" I was expecting her to have some plans for us, but instead she calls to tell me she's "checking on me" and that she's going to her exboyfriend's house to watch Saturday Night Live with him because it's a tradition they have had for awhile. I became upset, as you could imagine, and she could tell on the phone. I told her that my roommate and I were going out, and that I would talk to her some other time then. So, my roommate and I prep to go out. I should probably mention that I have had a habit of doing dip, snuff, tobacco, or whatever the proper term is for it, and i've been attempting to break the habit for my girlfriend since she hates it. Well, I grab the last dip can I had in my room (it was in the trash can half empty), and I put the biggest dip all along my lower lip. I was so pissed off! My roommate and I then start walking out the doors to our cars, and as I walk out the sliding door, there she is! First thing she says to me is. "You have dip in. " We were a couple of very angry people that night. She had canceled plans with her exbf to come see me. I was then obligated to cancel with my roommate. We walked into my dorm room, and had a long talk that night. She was very upset at me for dipping, but she is also trying to reassure me that she and her exboyfriend are just friends and nothing more. It's very hard for me to cope with. I don't want to break up with her because I like her so much, and I feel we are very compatible aside from this one issue that I don't see eyetoeye with her on. I'm going to try to go along with this and maybe get to know her exboyfriend a little bit better. Maybe that will help me. Only time will tell. Well, it's been fun, but my time is up now. Thanks. 
__label__label0 Well, hello. I am really not sure what to write about, I guess I can start with my day. You see, I am a commuter. I live in LOCNAME. No one in LOCNAME seems to know where that is but it is a little town on the other side of the airport. So, anyway, that means that I have the privilege of driving through morning traffic for an hour just to get to class, then what is even worse it that I get to drive back home through five o'clock traffic. It is a pain in the backside. I hate ORGNAME ORGNAME. On the up side, I was lucky enough to schedule all 00 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That helps because I am also a Parttime employee with fulltime hours at the only department store in LOCNAME. Three years ago the store opened meaning that PROPNAME now had a ORGNAME, ORGNAME, and ORGNAME. That is about it for stores. So, about my job, I am a Sales Associate. We recently switched new districts into the LOCNAME area. The District Manager is very strict on how the store is arranged. Last week, whoever did the schedule only scheduled me to work on Saturday for Five hours. You can not pay bills working at a minimum wage job for five hours a week. So I told my Store Manager that I would be more than happy to come in if she needed any help prior to PROPNAME (the District manager) coming in on that Friday. In the end I worked ten days in a row, pulling in forty hours before Friday when the District Manager was going to be in to audit. I was exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around. I was thankful that my Manager let me have Sunday off, I needed the rest. Today is my anniversary, I have been dating a guy for eight months now. This is probably of no concern to you but I am very proud of that fact. He goes to Incarnate Word in LOCNAME LOCNAME. He is an Eagle Scout and spends all summer teaching camp at Lost Pines Boy Scout Reservation. On weekends, he comes back to LOCNAME to ref. Soccer games at the BYSO Soccer fields. All this volunteering helped him when it came to my parents approval. You know, one time in my Drama Class, a friend of mine started to do just a stream of consciousness monologue. In the end he was talking about mixed drinks and jelly beans, it was very funny. I miss my Drama Class. Most of my high school stuff I had to give up due to the need to be able to afford college and get my degree. I had to quit dancing, I had danced for 00 years at a local studio. Then I had to give up ORGNAME ORGNAME, an organization that I was the captain of for all four years of High school. Most upsetting though was giving up Drama. If I was not in a play I always tried to contribute somehow. I single handedly costumed four productions in one year in my "spare time". Oh well, I guess that is it for mow. 
__label__label0 Isn't it amazing how lifting weights can make you so aware of your muscles? Every last inch of me is sore. I am such a weenie. Exercising is fun though. It helps me relieve stress. I'm already starting to feel a little stressed here. I wonder if I am an abnormally stressed person. What is a normal stress level? I'm having a hard time deciding which organizations to be in. I want to be in communication organizations to help me be prepared for my career but I also want to be involved in a Christian organization. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME sounds neat but it takes up a lot of time. I wish I were better at knowing what God wants me to do. I want to follow Him and to be patient but I also don't want to not be assertive and let opportunities slid past me. I feel like much of my life I have been too laid back, letting things come to me. I'm tired of being out to lunch. I want to prove to my dad and my brother that I can be responsible and detail minded. I want so badly to get a 0. 0 this semester. I feel so torn. Part of me says drive hard! Study hard! Don't let organizations take time away from academics! Prove you are worthy! But I know that I need to follow God and the He is what gives me value. I am probably making too big of a deal out of all of this. I think I'm just frustrated with mistakes I've made in the past. I need to let those go and not worry about what my dad and brother think. I know my dad has faith in me deep down. I just feel sad and I don't really know why. I just wish I had more direction but even as I type that I know I just need to listen to God. I guess that's the problem  I'm mad that I don't get a clear answer from God. It's so hard. I've never been totally sure of what God wanted for me. Well maybe that's not true, but I never hear his voice telling me what to do. I wasn't even sure if coming to LOCNAME was what He wanted. I saw lots of doors open up for ORGNAME and when I was expecting to see bad things about UT I found that it really wasn't that bad and the students were really friendly. Now I'm trying to figure out what decision to make about organizations and I'm secondguessing every phone call from members in the organizations and the gut feelings I have when I go to the meetings. I don't feel any strong direction and I'm mad, frustrated. There must be something I'm doing wrong. I want to be closer to God but every time I try I end up getting so confused and frustrated with Him and myself. Why does being on the verge of tears for a long time make you have a headache? Man I hate how my desk is set up. Gosh, I'm being so negative. I really hope my paper is the one out of 000 that y'all decide to read. This really isn't representative of what I am like. Tonight is just a bad night. God has given me so much yet I worry about so much. Like my business and professional speaking class. I don't like the idea of being graded on my performance. I know I won't make eye contact and make all sorts of other mistakes and get a bad grade. Wow! Listen to me. I'm going to be one of the people they call to do a study of depressed people with low selfesteem. I put on that questionnaire that I am generally happy and have a high selfesteem but that was last week. Tonight for the first time since moving down here I feel sad. I was so proud of myself for not freaking out and adjusting well. Maybe God is trying to show me that I really can't do this on my own. 
__label__label0 this is now the third time I am writing this paper and I am honestly pretty sick of it. the first time I wrote this, I hit a delete button and erased my entire paper. the second time, the system went down so I couldn't submit my writing. hopefully this time everything will go as planned. I don't really pay much attention usually to how thoughts enter my mind but I think I know generally how my mind works. as long as there is nothing around me stimulating my thoughts I generally think about my insecurities (I am always thinking about how things could be different if say, I were prettier, or smarter, or more outgoing, or whatever), singing a song in my head (whether it be from the radio or a commercial), or stressing myself out over a test or something. if I do see something, like a young couple walking a dog in a park for example, I first take the event for what it is. t might think to myself "oh what a cute couple" or "that is a cute dog. " as the event passes though, I tend to relate whatever I just saw to me personally. I would probably think to myself, "I want to get a dog once I get my own apartment. " my thoughts would quickly digress as I would think of other things I could do with my own place. I would imagine decorating the walls, planting a garden, or even in what part of the city I would want my place to be in. my point is that my thoughts rarely stay on one subject matter. I quickly move from one thing to another, forgetting about whatever it was that I was just thinking about. thoughts simply lead to other thoughts, with one small detail changing the mind track completely. 
__label__label0 THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR HERE AT LOCNAME AND I AM ENJOYING IT. I AM A TRANSFER STUDENT FROM DALLAS AND I AM MAJORING IN EDUCATION. I HOPE TO TEACH IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN DALLAS. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT OFF OF RIVERSIDE WITH MY BESTFRIEND. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR BOTH OF LOCNAME TO BE APART FROM OUR FAMILIES. I AM DOING GOOD. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE HOME SICK THE FIRST WEEK HERE. BOY WAS I WRONG! I WENT HOME THIS PAST WEEKEND BECALOCNAMEE MY BESTFRIEND HAD A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT IN DALLAS. I WAS SO READY TO COME HOME(ALOCNAMETIN). I HAD ALREADY STARTED TO MISS MY CUTE LITLLE APARTMENT AND THE PEACE AND QUIETNESS THAT I HAVE HERE. MY FRIENDS CAME IN FOR THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND TO VISIT. THEY WERE ONLY HERE TWO DAYS AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY BOTH MISS IT. IN THE SPRING SEMESTER MY OTHER BEST FRIEND WILL BE MOVING DOWN HERE FOR SCHOOL. SHE IS ALSO MAJORING IN EDUCATION. WE BOTH LOVE KIDS VERY MUCH. NEXT FALL WE WILL ALL BE LIVING TOGETHER. IT WILL BE FOUR OF LOCNAME IN ALL. WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS. ALL OF US ARE VERY CLOSE AND I WORSHIP OUR FRIENDSHIP. I HAVE A LITTLE SISTER WHO IS A SOPHOMORE AT A MAGNET SCHOOL IN DALLAS. WE USUALLY DON'T GET ALONG BUT THAT IS NORMAL FOR OUR AGES AND FOR US TO BE SIBLINGS. I HAVE TWO OLDER SISTERS WHO I GET ALONG WITH PERFECTLY AND MISS VERY MUCH. THE ONE I SEEM TO MISS EVEN MORE IS MY PRECIOUS DARLING NEPHEW PROPNAME. HE WILL BE FOUR YEARS OLD IN NOVEMBER. AND IS AS SPOILED AS THEY COME. MY FAMILY IS VERY CLOSE. MY MOTHER AND LITTLE SISTER ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE LIVING AT HOME. MY FATHER PASSED WAY IN 00 FROM LEUKEMIA. I HAVE TWO BROTHERNLAWS WHOM TRY THEIR HARDEST TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. AND DO A GOOD JOB. I AM TAKING 00 HOURS THIS SEMESTER AND WILL HAVE A FULL SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF. I WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY OF MY OWN IN THE FUTURE. I WANT AT LEAST TWO KIDS. I KNOW I WILL BE A GOOD MOTHER. I DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT ANY TIME SOON. RIGHT NOW I AM ONLY WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF MY SCHOOL. 
__label__label0 Hmmmm. What am I going to write for my stream of consciousness. I don't even know if I spelled that word right. Oh, well. I guess I just write whatever comes into my head. By the way, I have to fill out my daily schedule for my EDP 000 class. Don't forget about that. It's kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands aren't as fast as my thoughts. (That's obviously a good thing). What's on my mind. This is a lot harder than I thought. Sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and I just draw a blank. Nothing to write about. I wish that I can draw pictures on this thing but I can't. I tend to be a more visual person and I get a lot more pictures in my head than words. I think I'm going a bit over twenty minutes, although it doesn't seem like it. I just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because I want something to pop in my head so I can write it down, but nothing happens. It seems like when you want your mind to wander, it has a harder time doing it, but if you're trying to concentrate on something, like when you're taking a test, your mind can't stop wandering. I guess that's the amazing thing about the brain. so unpredictable. At least to the untrained individual who doesn't know what to look for it seems unpredictable. Maybe not so much for an expert. Its funny how the mind works. Anyway, I don't want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so I think that my time is up. Until next time. Ooohhh my arm itches  
__label__label1 I was just thinking about how different college is from high school. I haven't come home from going out every night until 0am and I think my roommate is getting really upset with me. I feel bad because she never goes out and when I tell her I'm going out I think she feels left out. I am going to start inviting her. We knew each other in high school and now we're living together which is kind of weird but it's working out really well. People always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but it's been working so far. She is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meit's fun. I just broke up with my boyfriend of 0 years last weekend. That was really tough because we were so close. He doesn't go to ORGNAME so that was making it really difficult. I miss him. I am dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated a year earlier. He's really cool and we get along but it isn't the same. We'll just see how it works out. I miss my family. I am so used to seeing them everyday and now that I don't it's weird. I was so ready to get out of the house but now that I am officially out it's sad. I feel so old. I have to be independent which stinks. When I first got here, my computer wasn't working so I had to take it to the repair place and I got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously. That was kind of liberating, though. Doing something important by yourself. I was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant. I always had my mom do it. So, coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird. I haven't had much homework lately. I thought college was really tough and so far it really hasn't been. My roommate has tons of homework every night and I just haven't. I feel like I am missing out on the college experience. Today, I am going to College Station to visit my friend. We are going to see PROPNAME PROPNAME in concert which will be totally awesome. I love PROPNAME PROPNAME. My roommate is going to the Dave Matthews Concert in DallasI am jealous. she has been home every weekendthat's probably not healthy. Her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him a lot. I think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home. I don't really think she is homesickjust bored. Austin is such a great citypeople always told me that once you go to Austin you won't want to leave. I can see how that can happen. There's always something to do. I am starting to run out of things to talk aboutI think my 00 minutes are almost over. I found somethingthe Freshman 00. I am not going to gain thatbut, I can definitely see how that happens. You definitely have more spare time in college than we did in high school. I was really busy in high school. I was on drill team and I had practice every night until 0. I didn't have much time to myself. Now I do. I get bored. My dad just got a new car. It's weird that he has a new car and I've never seen it. My little sister had her 00th bday yesterday and she told my momwhen is sara coming home? My mom said, she lives three hours away, she can't come home tonight because she'll have to drive back for class the next day. When my mom told me that I started crying because it hasn't hit my little sister yet that I moved out. We used to not be close but we are nownow that we are growing up. Well, my 00 minutes are upit's been nice talking to you. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm listening to PROPNAME. The band not the person. It can be really confusing talking about all the PROPNAMEes that I know. There's the band, which happens to be from LOCNAME and is really awesome. Then there is PROPNAME who goes to school here. There is PROPNAME who goes to ORGNAME and who I dated at the beginning of the summer. I really liked him. It's too bad that didn't work out. Then there is PROPNAME who goes to ORGNAME and who I really like a whole lot. I've liked him for almost two years now. We just really connect and get along. It's crazy when you meet someone you just work with. I have met a few people like that, and I'm not just talking about boys, but all relationships. I always feel lucky when I know someone who is like me, who I can just hang out with and be boring with and just have so much fun. My mom and I are like that too. I miss her so much. She is my best friend. I know some people say that, and it just becomes another petty phrase, but when I say it, I mean it with all of my heart. She is the most awesome person I have ever met. I want to be just like her. That is my goal, my stretch, the place I know I can never reach, but my dream. She is my stars. I would be so happy even to be half as great as she is. She is a teacher, but not only in the sense that she works at a school and teaches her students French. It is one of her innate gifts. She is a teacher and a nurturer. When you let her be those two things, awesome things happen. Now that I let her be those things in my life, we have the most fulfilling relationship one could ever ask for. All I have to do is hear her voice and I am practically in tears. It's crazy how much I miss her. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. I just want to be with her all of the time. It's crazy how this is my mother and I feel so close to her. I'm not supposed to be in that place for at least a few more years. I guess I am just incredibly lucky. My family is the most important thing in my life. I figure it will take time until I get used to being away from them. I don't think anyone would ever peg me as the homesick type. I would have never pegged myself as the homesick type. I had no clue I would take it this hard. That's a surprise. I guess it's such a shock because two years ago first of all I was not so close to them, and I was a major stoic. No feeling. And now I am not afraid to admit that I love my family and miss them. I think that I am going to go home this weekend. I wasn't planning on it, but I don't want to stay away from them that much longer and there's no reason I have to since I do live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. It's not like it's a terrible trip. My father makes it every day. I don't know if I'm going to though. I really don't want to ride home between two huge men in my dad's carpool again, and I don't have my car yet so I don't know. I'm still listening to my Travis CD and really enjoying. It's on the last song, which lasts almost 00 minutes and is like 0 songs in one. It is really great. Sometime I have to listen to the words though, because I really have no idea what it is about. Now I'm back to being excited about seeing the band. It's in less than two weeks, and Travis from ORGNAME is coming down to see them with me. That is going to be so awesome. I really want to go home but the whole carpool thing really bugs me. Maybe I should call my dad and tell him that. Just tell him that I don't want to ride home with his carpool because that is a terrible experience. Maybe he would be able to work something out for me. Well, the CD stopped, and twenty minutes has elapsed, so those are my cues to stop writing. I'm going to go make my decision now. 
__label__label1 Twenty minutes seems like a long time when you are asked to just sit there and type something but when you think about it it really isn't that long. You can do all sorts of things in twenty minutes that are enjoyable such as play guitar (which I don't) or scuba or imagine you are climbing mount everest and even if you don't do any of these things it is fun to pretend to do so. I normally am happy that I type very fast but now I'm realizing that since this is timed that will be a disadvantage to my fingers which hurt sometimes after I type for a long time, maybe I'm too old for this type of exercise. Its possible. Anyways, only two minutes have passed and this doesn't seem to be going anywhere. While we are on the subject of contractions in the English language, I noticed that I haven't been putting apostrophes in all of my contractions and that would probably make English teachers spin in their graves but it doesn't really bother me because I am a double EE/physics major and don't have to take any English classes ever ever hahaha, oh sorry, got the best of me, anyways where was I? I like orchids, they are the coolest flower. And that reminds me of that chinese art with the brushes where they use really dark ink to make the branches of trees or limbs of bushes and then really bright red or other color to make the petals of the flowers. The thing I like about those is that they don't have any leaves and I really wish I could do that art as they could. And now a whopping five minutes has passed and I am 0/0 done with this assignment and I don't know how I can possible continue writing this fast for that long but I guess I will have to endure, because if the Romans could withstand years of constant battle and such things (I don't want to pick the right word that would be a sign of conscious thought and we don't want that right now for this exercise (I hope I'm spelling that right)) where was I, you if the Romans can withstand all that battling and make all their cool things with limited resources then the LEAST I can do is write this for twenty measly minutes which really isn't that long and I'm thinking I could leave this here and say I'm a slow typist but that would be morally wrong and would be grounds for going to the effigy of fiery hell that is ruled by Satan and I don't know why I'm talking about this because I am not religious at all and the reason that is is because (is is is not good to use in a sentence, especially not is is is) sorry, anyways the reason I'm not religious is because of my scientific type of mind and even though my parents are religious (although not devoutly or anything) I still have trouble believing in any type of organized religion because if those people that made the religion or believe in it were born in a different country they would believe something different than they do now. and its still only been 0 minutes so this is going to be pretty long I assume. I used to test my typing speed while doing exercises like this because I can think of random things to say aster than I can read them so there is less of a limit to trying to put things into the keyboard (which by the way when you want to get something from the keyboard in C++ you have to type; near the top, and who said these classes didn't tie in together, they were obviously wrong. I'm really starting to run out of ideas so I think I will talk about PROPNAME a little while and why his philosophy is related to that of PROPNAME PROPNAME's song "bad", actually that is all complete BS but if I talk in an eloquent enough manner no one will know, save the PROPNAME philosophers who are aficionados of PROPNAME PROPNAME I really have to go back through this and be sure to fix all my errores gordos (that's what Mr. pickering called them in Spanish class, meaning fat errors, or errors that shouldn't be in a paper because they are so basic that no one should miss them, like capitalization and spelling and such) anyways I have 0 more minutes and I'm typing as fast as I was and this fan really is blowing some stinky air through the room and neither I nor my room mate can think of where the stench is coming from and I had put a typo on the last is which read S until I changed it and I bet you are glad you know that now, it put a lot of your worries to rest now that you know that I fixed my typo (hey that rhymed, pretty neat huh) and what's with all these words like neat and phat and off the hook and such, they are fun to say but why do we feel the need to say them, I was reading an article about how it helps teenagers identify themselves as distinct characters in a world of homogenous people and that kind of makes sense hold on I'm getting an ORGNAME Instant message, but its from a person who I don't want to talk to at the moment because of some stuff that happened even though its all better know I must have a VERY long runon sentence but it doesn't matter now because this is not English class. back to that Instant message, someone just messaged me again and this time they are talking on some microphone and I'm supposed to be able to tell what they are saying but all it sounds like is a bunch of static and a low, distorted "HALLOW", hello, you see. and while I'm on the topic of jargon and slang I can explain to you some of the hold on some person in my dorm just walked in and he has on a grey shirt and his name is payab, but I'm not sure he is a freemason, speaking of which they are the people that lead a cultist movement and there was this person named PROPNAME in our class who went to the air force and me and my friend always called him MASSSSONNNNNNN really loudly and obnoxiously when we saw him in the hall and thank the lord I only have a minute left of this assignment my fingers are tired and this sentence has been going (is sentence or sentence the correct spelling) anyways this has been going on for too long and now I want to quit and I'm looking down at the bottom right of my screen to see when the clock will hit 0:00 but is hasn't yet oh well close enough. 
__label__label0 Things have changed so much since I got to college. Everything has taken a complete and utter flipside to the norm. I came here with two of my best friends from high school and now we are no longer speaking. Things get complicated. My plans for the upcoming and muchawaited Texas/Oklahoma Game has managed to break up a friendship very important to me. Its insane that such a petty conflict in such an unimportant situation can kill something that I've known so well for the past few years. Regardless, my life is so different now. I went through high school on a very tight leash with my parents and now I have no restrictions. No more "be in by one o'clock", no more "you can't spend the night out" no more "do your homework". Even though I'm supported by them primarily, I make my own decisions now. It seems a lot easier to go with the flow of things around here, do what I really want to do and not worry about what my parents think is the best decision or the right choice. School has also changed. I love my classes, my professors are wonderful, but the actual academics are a good deal harder. I went to a 0A school taking all honors classes, and everyone told me how the hard academics I was in then would make UT a breeze. Wroooong. I'm going to pull through, I'm determined. I love where I am. 
__label__label1 It's been a long day and my head and body are tired. I think that my classes are going well but I feel a little worrisome due to the fact that I have not had a grade taken in any of them. I see people in school and wonder what they are thinking, and wonder why so many people are afraid. They seem scared to talk or to smile or even look up while they are walking this huge campus. With so many people around and the diversity being so big I feel they are missing out and are short changing the rest of their school by not being social. Lately, work keeps awake at night. I always feel as if I have things to do but do feel like doing them. I get upset that my teachers make us read so much. They need to be more hands on to get my attention. Also it seems as if school is not that big of a deal to my friends it bothers me because I don't like school either but I still have to do it. I guess this is what college is all about. The few that do take it seriously are the people that end up doing the best, at least I hope. But what happens to all the people that don't take it seriously. You always hear about those individuals that struck it rich because they didn't follow the norm. I wonder if I'm one of those people. I know that either way I'm lazy so I don't think I'll find out. I miss laura, I think of her a lot and I see her image in a lot of faces. I see curly hair and I imagine her walking, or if I see her figure on a girl I look up to see the face but its' not her. I wish she was here for at least a second. just that one touch of her hand made things better. She always made me laugh and happy. I think I did the same for her, but I still wish she was here with me. love is weird. I think love is something that everybody has with one another and with some it's even stronger. And that strong love is what causes the weird stuff like marriage and so forth. But I wish people would only say love when they meant it. It's used so frequently that now it doesn't have the same affect as it used to. but oh well who really cares. I think laura was the one person who understood what love meant to me, her and my mom both knew. But everybody else thinks I'm weird. Why is a relationship bad to have even if it is long distance isn't that relationship better than not having one at all. I feel that if you really care distance can't stop what the heart feels even if you can't see, touch or hear them.

I've never cheated even though it would be easy for me somehow my girlfriend would find out i know it. i really want to play video games right now. if video games and girls didnt exist i probably would already be a doctor. I am extremely smart well not extremely but i am capable of handling anything i think. i get pissed off so easily if people call me dumb which im not. i don't dress up at all here and i still look good i wish i didnt have acne i swear if i was in a stupid frat i would be swimming in women, why do girls liek frat guys those guys are thick headed they wouldnt be able to maintain a healthy relationship if i pointed a gun to their heads, everyone in austin drives horribly. I swear its almost as if they want to run pedestrians over each time i walk home. fuck them i would have no remorse killing anyone running me over or even try a sad attempt to kill me. i feel im going to be around for a long time. i hope god will always forgive me for things i do, i love god its just hard to include him in my life all the time. my girlfriend just called me she almost told my brother she had period god that would been awful thank god. i hate cell phones they hurt my head oh now its breaking up whata  surprise. my girlfriend  always calls at bad times i find myself rarely needing to talk to her all it end up is doing something i  don't want to do. ugh shut up tracy i don't care go  jamba juice  soudns good right now. i hope punctuation doesnt matter  my computer is so old. thursday night at club 000 was such a waste of time, i saw stupid mexican trash pissing on an escalade i hate mexican trash i feel fine openly saying this because guess what im one of them except i actually have whiter skin and better manners and a brain. i am the best damn latin man out there if only more girls knew, if only i knew spanish.

__label__label1      Well I am sitting in my apartment thinking how weird it is to live by myself with out a roomate. I stair at my fish, and don't know many of my neighbors since I am new to the LOCNAME area. My room is a mess, I am a total slob and hate to admit that. However, I would clean it up if I had a guest or to. But not during the week me and my friends are busy doing homework and trying to inteact with orginizations around the LOCNAME campus. I still miss my dance at LOCNAME. I worked so hard for that team and myself finally made friends in that little town. I am happy to be at a new school though for a new fresh start. Tryouts for the UT dance team are on thursday and I am debating back and forth if I will make it and how bad I really want it. I know for a fact I really want that spot on the dance team it would be a complete honor. But then again I have this attitude that if I don't care the dissapointment will not hurt as bad if I don't get the spot. I am just so use to being on a dance team and belonging to a group. Everyone knows me as the dancer. so what am I now if I don't make the dance team?  I actually miss home its been about a month and a half since I have seen my parents and I miss my 0 cats soo bad!  I miss my ex boyfriend terribly and wish I could see although he is 0 and 0/0 hrs away at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I miss those hugs he would give everyday even when we were friends they honestly made me feel good inside. I am acutally quite bothered that my boyfriend won't call me back. I haven't seen him in 0 days and just wanted to see him for a little while. Everytime I ask him if I can see him and have to ask still after 0 months of going out he always answers with a I don't know. I feel like I need a lot of attention and hurts my feelings when he seriously does that. Not allowed to hang out with my best guy friend because these two don't get along however I don't agree with that and hang out with him anyways. I don't feel as I have to clear everything with him. I am happy that I have my two best friends here though quite close on campus. One my bestfriend from highschool didn't see much of eachother there for a while because I went away to school for 0 years and she stayed home. PROPNAME and me have been roomates for 0 years in a tiny dorm room and decided that we wanted to live by ourselves for a change. I actually enjoy it and can do as I please. I am aslo worried about finding study buddys for my classes because I am sure my grades will be better if I study with others. Its hard to just start talking to people. when I am new I can be a bit shy. But once you get to know me I am a quite talkative person full of energy but people don't know that unless they approach me. I need to dye my hair red again becuase my mousy brown hair is starting to show again and I hate it. . glad I don't have to go to work today becaue i have soo much to do this week. I should really clean up my apartment because I have a major ant problem going on here especially in the kitchen. Its one of my best friends birthday's today I called her up and shes going out tonight wish I was here but I'm not in LOCNAME. Wish I could be home. My dad just lost his job but has been wanting to leave for awhile. And does have a back up he has his own business called    ORGNAME ORGNAME  . Now I am glad he can dedicate all he can to his dreams which is having a successful business of his own. I am worried about him though he has been very stressed out latley. I need to call T. C to get help with my homework. . I will pass that darn T. A. S. P test soon! I don't have any other choice I am eager to get out of math and graduate college.  
__label__label1      Well, I am sitting here fighting with myself about whether or not I should go out tongight. It looks like i will probably give in and go to the KA house. I don't think I should because I have a lot of work to do. I am excited to go and see my grandmother tomorrow. I miss my friends a lot especially justin. I am wondering why I haven't been able to get a hold of him. so I don't have a lot on my mind, but this is fun because I get to listen to all of the music I just downloaded. our tv in the living room is super loud! I can hear it over my music and through a closed door. Things with bryan seem to be going well, but I definitely don't see things progressing too much further. I am really tired today. I should be sleeping a lot more than I have been. oh well. I need to do my devotional before I go anywhere tonight because I will feel really bad if i forget. I am very concerned about justin. I cannot stop thinking about what our issues are or aren't. I wonder what my parents are doing tonight. I miss seeing them every day, but at least I talk to them a lot. It feels super weird to be away and completely on my own, but I think I will surprise myself at how well I will do. That pizza that I ate earlier was not good. I guess it doesn't settle well because I don't eat it very often. I am so excited about my KIN class. It is so awesome, and I love that the professors are married and christians. That's so great. PROPNAME is really cool, too, and I am very glad that she is in that class with me. I hope we end up hanging out a lot this year. I was so worried about meeting people who loved God, and it's been really reassuring so far. The tri-delts are perfect girls for me. They're so good, and they have 0 bible studies!  Yea!  PROPNAME PROPNAME is really talented. It cracks me up that I've gotten so into this computer business. It's really fun, though. I got my first email today. Who better from but PROPNAME?  He's awesome, but it sucks that he lives in LOCNAME. Okay, I am having a lull. I really feel very exhausted, but of course I will go out as soon as I finish this assignment. It is so stupid how vain I have gotten since I have been here, but I am sure that that will go away after a little time. I am so nervous about taking my first tests. I love all of my classes, but I wonder about how prepared I am from high school, and how well my study habits will allow me to do. This assignment is really very cool. I thought it would  take forever, but the time is flying. So I am very cold right now; surprise, surprise. I think of my girls from LOCNAME every time that I begin a sentence with so. I definitely should not do that very much. My mother would not be proud of me.   Unchained Melody   must be one of the most romantic songs ever recorded. It makes me miss PROPNAME. I suppose I will try to call him again right now. 
__label__label1      I'm in a state of confusion. I'm in a library just staring at people as they walk through the door. I'm feeling sleepy, just sitting in front of a computer deliriously. My nose is stuffed up but I can still smell. I smell some type of perfume, not so great nor so bad. I'm feeling nervous, feeling like there is someone watching every bit of move I make. The wall is very white with few uninteresting posters, there are a lot of people but yet. so quiet. I feel like I'm dreaming, just sleep walking my way around. I feel nervous about everything that surrounds me. I sense the air full of intelligence and suffering from the people(student's) minds. As I type, I still feel nervous and confused about everything. I feel cold, mainly the lower body, it feels as if I am in a water full of ice. It's somewhat painful and somewhat a numb feeling. I suddenly start to notice the sounds of people clicking the mouse on the computer and I hear myself type as I stroke the keyboard with force and precision. I see a lot of books, mostly thick covered: don't know what they are used for though. The desk is filthy as if it had never been cleaned, it's full of dusts and paper wads. I feel lonely simply because I'm sitting alone but then again everyone else is sitting by themselves. I see  a person staring at a book calmly as he stretches. Everything around this place seems strange even myself. It seems as if everyone is just here to kill time. They are just here to amuse themselves. Perhaps I'm talking about myself. 
__label__label0 Ummm. haven't done this since 0th grade. Thinking always gets ahead of the recording. Allergy's in the air, uncomfortable contacts. PROPNAME's still here, said he was going to the store. Grammar's gotten lax. Cats on the couch. At least they're not playing. Place is messy-I should clean but I probably won't. Twenty minutes is a rather long time. Is that to get to the truer feelings?  After getting too bored for anything else in 00?  I had a feeling that was the purpose of the 0. 0 hour questionaire. I don't know if I spent 0. 0 hours, but it took forever. And I started the questions too late at night. After answering pages of them I didn't want to back out. Have a   ORGNAME ORGNAME   experiment scheduled Friday. I'm peeved that they didn't give you any idea what you were signing up for. Is it necessary not to fill in the participants?  And my vision isn't 00/00. It's not terribly far from, but I hope they don't check and kick me out. I never use this desk (the one at home) and it's filled with papers and trash that isn't mine. I hate stacks of other people's paper. Filled with cryptic scribbles. I don't feel like I can throw it out, but the odds of it being valuable are pretty slim. Strip Tease with PROPNAME PROPNAME is on cable tonight. I've never seen it, but I watch 00 minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off. I'm trying to watch less crap tv, but it seems like that's all there is lately. I wonder when the new season starts?  I should try to watch something other than PROPNAME this year. It's easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials. But if I'm only going to watch one, I guess it should be something other than PROPNAME. My typing has gotten pretty decent. I used to type 00-00 wpm, but typing at work has improved that. Most of my practice though is personal email at work. I waste way too much time online instead of working. It's just so easy with the way my computer faces. I wonder how obvious it is though. I'm rambling, but I feel like I'm suppose to be talking to someone. I say   used   and   supposed  . I'm fairly sure that's wrong (but not sure, which is sad). I always say it, and I can live with that, but I type it too, and can never decide if I should make a change or not. PROPNAME said he was going to the store. I'm paranoid about him reading it for some reason. He just walked up behind me and started to read some, and I asked him not to. It's silly-there's nothing in here that he doesn't already know. And I ramble just like this to him frequently (probably too frequently) and don't have to screen my thoughts much. At least less than with anyone else. But I've always been shy about my writing. I wouldn't even let my parents read the dryest of papers that I wrote, much less one's that were on personal matters. Fish tank in the room, we let moss grow pretty heavily before we bought a cleaning fish. The fish has done a good job though. And it's a good thing we only have neons and guppies, can't kill 'em. Boredom, boredom. Only 0 minutes to go. I wonder how many of these will be read through, and I wonder how many of these wonder how many of these will be read through. Are all people boring like me?  Even witty, entertaining people?  Are there thoughts more exciting?  Does being   on   mean acting like something, not really being one's boring self. Strange itch it my back. I know it's silly, but lately I've felt creaky, like the very mild beginning twinges of getting old. I should excersize. I know I should. I get winded going up a flight of stairs, and I can stand to lost 00 or 00 pounds. I try to diet even though I know the sucess rate from dieting alone (calorie restriction) is dismal. And the PROPNAME's diet thing. Although it evidently works for many people, it's obviously targeted diet in my opinion. That may not be fair, but from my own observations women are much more likely to eat a carbohydrate based diet, while men like to get more calories from meat. PROPNAME calls a carbohydrate diet unnatural and unhealthy. And that's ludicrious. Perhaps his diet is healthy, but it doesn't follow that the other is not. Only five seconds left, does the timer stop by itself?  Went over time, but couldn't resist finishing the sentance. Shave and a hair cut, two bits.        
__label__label0      I was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because I've never really done anything like this. So i decided to put it off until the last minute. It is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. Im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. So far I havent really met any new people that I would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. I think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ORGNAME. It is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. Although I know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. I don't know I guess will just have to see how things turn out. One thing that I am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. In fact she is a mere stones throw away in LLD. She means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. I mentioned LLD well that is a girls dorm, near LLB which is my dorm PROPNAME court that I now call home. Whitis is a nice little community although I don't much enjoy some of the company here. The rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in Jester. However its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. It seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. I guess its just one more thing Ill have to get used to. Not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. I am also planning on joining the ORGNAME ORGNAME and going to the ORGNAME course this summer. It is a big step  in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. My father was a marine and his father was in the army and I feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. One thing that I would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. Me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. It seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. I know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. Hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. He came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. I really do love and care for my family but I believe they think much to the contrary. I guess I don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. This short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much I miss them. 
__label__label0      WEll college is something i was definetly not prepared for. In high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, I go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. So far in the during these 0-0 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. Which leaves me to consider that perhaps I should buy one of those rolling back packs. The readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. Although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting.           I really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. Always relying on fast food is disgusting. A person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. Which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. I have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. Because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. The peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. All they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them.        My classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. I believe i can do though. I have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. I wake- up at 0:00 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. She, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 0:00 am i am off to UT. Once i arrive on campus the time is 0 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. Our first class doesn't begin until 00 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. By the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 0pm and i get home at 0 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. But i realize i must read a chapter for Rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 00am, and once again i only get about 0 hours of sleep. This system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. I see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. Makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. Actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. I don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. This makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.            
__label__label0      Right now I am sitting in my room. my TV ison and I'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. I have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as UT does. Right now I'm here in my dorm room, it kind ORGNAME smells like B. O. , but I think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up ORGNAME mess that my room-mate and I have made. The TV is on right now and it's kind of distracting but I'm not going to say anythign because I would consider that rude. Is it bad that I put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. Dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth I really don't care what others think about me. All i care about is what I think of myself, and whether I'm happy with myself or not. At this point I'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. I miss it though. I really don't think that I was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. Is it bad that I don't like school?I know that it's only going to   benefit my future   and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. People don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. It does not cost anything to dream. I'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. I'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. I think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. I set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then I have a total break down. I feel as though I am a failure and I probably will not amount to anything. If you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. I'm sure that by now you can tell that. I'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. I'm very much more comfortable with a 00:0 ratio classes. I'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a   B   I would say   A   but that goes back to my really high standards. Instead of being dissappointed I would rather achieve something that I know that I can probably complete. I think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. I will always wonder if I was ever able to fufill that   A   that i wasnt but never really went for. Does this make me a bad person? I think not. I'm really considering going to a university back home. I'm here in the college of Fine Arts in the Dance department. What can you really do with a ORGNAME in Dance? I'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? There goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. I think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. I'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. I understand that UT isn't a specialized conservatory in the Arts, but if you are going to offer a major in Dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. I am really considering majoring in Psychology with a minor in Dance. The university back home, ORGNAME of the ORGNAME ORGNAME, offers a minor in dance and a major in Psychology which sounds like the perfect program. I was also thinking about Mass Media. I was thinking about being a talent agent. I need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I'm not sure what that is right now. 
__label__label1      Im sitting in my room at the towers, and I have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. However I do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. And if I had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. Yet I can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the Towers has to be the food. The cooks here should go down in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. And everytime I go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. Which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. As I look around my room I can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. Because he eats all of my food. I went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. I havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. This fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing I am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. But every once in a while I do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences I can say that PROPNAME, the guy with whom I share a room with, is a very nice person and I believe that we will get along very well. So far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. My other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. And PROPNAME has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. Yet the one guy that I am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate PROPNAME. Its not that there is hostility between us its just that I try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time I get yet he just won't seem to respond. Maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. Because I know when I was in high school this new guy moved in from LOCNAME and he really kept to himself along with his parents. But the more time I spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. But the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk a whole lot. And i had to remind my mom that thats how people are in LOCNAME, and just to give them time because they are really good people. 
__label__label1      Right now I am sitting in my room at my apartment on 0000 W. 00th street. The apartments are called the PROPNAME, and I live with two other people in the apartment number 000. I have been stressing all day about when I was going to find the time to do my psychology writing assignment. I honestly feel like I have not had time in the past 0 days to even sit down for twenty minutes just to type out a stream of my thoughts. This is a pretty neat assignment. I am thinking about how I missed my metals class last Thursday from eight o'clock in the morning until noon. Since I missed the lab, I have to go in this Friday from like eleven until my two o'clock government section. Right now I am so tired I can hardly even think about my day on Friday. I am also thinking about what I am going to do tonight. I wasn't really planning on going out, but one of my friends in my Government class today asked me if I was going to go with her, so I ended up having to go because I would have felt bad saying no to her. What about the pre-testing I am going to do after this writing assignment?  I hope it is not hard because I think my brain will just about break down. I really like psychology. I was talking to my dad about it on the phone yesterday, and I was asking him how I wondered why I never took a psychology class before. My high school offered psychology classes, I just never thought to take them. I took Sociology instead, and I actually didn't even like it very much which is weird because I ended up taking it once again before Psychology in College. I was actually thinking about my schedule for next semester. It is crazy, but I am actually already stressed about things for next year, like where I'm going to live, what classes I am going to take, make sure I live somewhere close to a bus stop. My bedroom is up the stairs in my apartment, it is pretty cool because me and one of my best friends live upstairs, and my other best friend lives downstairs. It is so cool because we have a great location, I mean, we are close to anything there is fun to do on LOCNAME LOCNAME. We can walk almost to any fraternity party, and to other of our friends' apartments who live around us. I ride the bus to class everyday, even though I could walk if I wanted too, but of course I don't. Plus, all of my classes are at the Art Building, and the West Campus bus takes you directly from almost the front of my apartment complex to the front doors of the Art Building. Three out of four of my classes are in the Art Building. It is kind of weird because only two of my classes actually involve art. Two dimensional design and Beginning Metals I. My government class is also in the Art Building, and I think it is because that is one of the few buildings on campus with an auditorium in it. I get really sick of being in the Art building, even though I run into the same people almost everyday and I know where just about any classroom is. I almost changed my major as a matter of fact, just because I was so incredibly sick of the whole art scene. But, I thought about it for a while, and i realized that designing jewelry is what I truly want to make a career out of. It is really frustrating though, because all of the art classes are four hours long, twice a week, AND i only get three hours of credit for them!  It is crazy!  I was going to actually apply to get into the Design school, other than just studio w/minor in metals, but I went to the seminar for Design and it is totally not what I had in mind. They do things like design posters, building, add things to computers in clip0-art and such and use things like digital cameras. We had to use digital cameras in my two dimensional design class yesterday and it was pretty cool. Although I had no idea to what my teacher's motives were behind the assignment I actually had fun. She paired me up with someone in my class that I don't think I ever talked to until yesterday. We walked from the Art building to the Tower twice!  Well, actually, we walked their twice because the camera we checked out said we could take 000 pictures. Yet, after only taking five, the camera said our memory card was full. It made me so mad, but it was okay in the end because we ended up getting our assignment done on time. I keep glancing up at the timer on the top of my screen I think almost every time I finish a sentence. I actually like this exercise because, even though I am timed, I actually am making some good points to myself. It is so weird how writers find themselves writing their best work, when they are not even meaning to or realizing they are doing it at all.  I am definitely not saying this is one of my best writings, but I just remembered somebody telling me that a long time ago. I wonder what I will be doing after I finish writing this. Right now I keep stopping every five seconds and checking the timer to see how much time has gone by. I am really hungry. I have not eaten anything since I think around 0000 this morning. I definitely should have grabbed something to eat before I started righting this, but oh well. What will I have for dinner?  hmm. i have no clue. I think after this, I will go ask one of my roommates to see if she can fix my computer because the ORGNAME doesn't work for somer reason. We just got our internet connection today, which is another reason why I am just now doing this assignment. 
__label__label1      I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at LOCNAME. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 00 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 00 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of ORGNAME. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his   alone time   with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video 
__label__label0      The library is so boring. I can't stand more than two hours of library a day. Daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. It is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. There are too many distractions and I believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. ORGNAME is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, I divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that I have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. I wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, I mean location of the computer, I have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. I have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance I may be watched. I am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. It is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother 
__label__label0      So, i'm like, I have NO idea what to write in a stream of consciousness for 00 consecutive minutes. So, I guess, I'll just start off with a recap of the week. Nothing. You've got these 00 minute classes (woo-hoo), then a whole day afterwards to blow. That goes on for a few more days, then. Hey hey!  A three day weekend. Blah, like I really have much of a life to actually spend those 0 days having much fun. But, it was a break, nonetheless. The last break I'll ever see in my given lifetime. Well, I headed home. That was the plan. Head home, leech off the folks one last time for a while, then I'd get back to my   studying  . Well, suffice to say, I'm back, and I guess you could genuinely call this   studying  . &lt;Changing mp0&gt;    same auld lang syne  . What an awesome slow song. Mellow. Sad. Right, so. I'm boring you. A computer. A simple man-made machine apt in dealing with 00% of my socializing. THANK YOU AIM. I've got stupid art history to read up for. Thirty something pages I do believe. God, I hate being sick. Just my brilliant luck, I get home, and the sniffles begin. Then a drippy nose. Then the stoppage. Ugh, PROPNAME is my new best friend. This song is making me sad. i got to sne0eze. *whew*  Violent. Gosh, I hope i can succeed in college. Off to a pretty bad start. Me, uncertain of what major I'd stay in. Writer's block sets in, here. The song's almost over. Hehe, It's kind of funny to think about. Ever since I got here, all i did was sit in front of this computer and downloaded away at my heart's content. I got movies, I got PROPNAME PROPNAME (the beloved japanese anime), and i got music. Did you know my music collection is about 0 Gigs right now?  I've got another gig stored away on CD. Hah, I'm such a loser. My self-defeatist attitude can't be good for me, but it helps me get a laugh. You know, it really pisses me off when people have no sense of humor. &lt;song change, brb&gt;  Another slow, mellow piece, by PROPNAME PROPNAME. He's an awesome pianist. I like to play the piano alot. When *secretly* i do it to please people. ORGNAME. My (un-)superior piano skills gets all the chicks. Don't i wish. It's not like I'm that good either. I had what, 0 years of classical training (which by the ways sounds pretty good on a transcript), but it's not like the teacher was all that great. Grr, I really hated her. She made piano the mainstay of what I should be doing. She really didn't care if I intonated that I had some project due the next day. I had to sit through stupid hour-long lessions, only to come home all feeling defeated. God. It's not like I ever really   practiced   either :). I lied a bunch when filling out practice charts. It's like:   Oh, yeah. I really DID play those 00 minutes every day.   What total BS :). Oh, Am I supposed to curse?  Can I curse?  I swear to myself everyday not to do it, but it's really starting to creep into my vocabulary. hah, I've been typing so long, and constant, I bet my roommate is wondering   What on EARTH could this guy be typing for that long anyways?    Hehe, oh well, he's cool, not much to worry about. Man, I was worried all weekend that strangers I didn't know would pervade through the room and take my stuff. I'm paranoid that way you know?  Some unfortunate event from the past always haunts me. Stupid burglars. They stole my stuff. I've been scared since. That's a story I tell everyone. Man, I have some major psychological problems. Hope this class sheds some light. You know, ever since I took Psych in senior year, I've had this very strong fascination towards this field. Heck, if I stayed on this course, I could become a doctor!  Study interesting stuff, AND get lots o MONEY!  But, I guess, I shouldn't let my ambitions get too far ahead of other pressing matters. Sixteen minutes and 00 seconds past. This assignment goes by pretty quick. This is really fun. You know, sometimes I really DO do this. Sit down, and just talk and rant about nothing for an extended period of time. It's fun. it's enlightening. Sometimes it's downright hilarious the things i write down. Hmm, I wish I were funnier. My friend PROPNAME has the best wit you'll ever see. Awesome with satire and sarcasm, he's the best guy to turn to for a laugh. Hah, just thinking about our antics I crack a smile. Oh boy!  an IM message. Too bad I can't answer it. Ok, well, i'll take a peek. Hey, we're playing basketball at gregory. I'm still feeling sick. I wonder if it's wise or not. I could just walk on the track some. I really don't feel like running around, aggrivating my sore throat. Ok, ten seconds left. Make the most of it. Hah, cya later.     Sweeeeet!  I can still write after the 0o minutes. But I guess that they'll only grade the first part. Ahh, this assignment has really brightened my day. Fun as heck. Well, I'm out. Later. 
__label__label1      I just ate at PROPNAME with my dad. Why is it that I feel like crying everytime I see him but I could care less about seeing my mom?  I guess I've always been a daddy's girl. I am waiting for my roommate, she's kind of helpless. Actually shes extremely helpless. I try to be understanding but shes clueless sometimes. Like hooking her computer up, maybe since my dad works for ORGNAME I have an advantage over other computer-illiterate people but really- red cord matches with red slot, green with green, etc. I feel like I have to take her everywhere with me. For instance, the reason I am waiting on her is because I'm going to my boyfriends house and she wants to come with me. I wouldn't mind except that I don't get to see PROPNAME (boyfriend) very often and when I do she wants to come with me. I feel bad for her, I mean in that she has no car to get around and I do but still I guess I am selfish like that. I am desperate to know why I sometimes want to shot PROPNAME- part of me loves him deeply and the other part wants to shake some sense into him. I guess I should just listen to my brother when he tells me PROPNAME's not the one and I shouldn't stress over it. I know PROPNAME's not Mr. Right but he sure is Mr. Right Now and thats fun too!  He's just super inconsiderate. We went to the same high school outside of LOCNAME at LOCNAME LOCNAME, its a 00 minute drive and he NEVER comes to see me, I always have to go see him. Thats not to say he doesnt tell me hes going to come out. He always says   sure baby I'll come see you tonight   but never follows through. I don't like dating PROPNAME that much I am just paranoid of being alone I guess. (plus TA in psychology class is kind of cute. )  I HATE the singles scene. I wonder why that is, I come from a stable family environment- my parents have been happily married for 00 years yet I find myself falling so hard for every guy I date!  Its pathetic. I think that I crave positive attention. See I was always the ugly duckling in middle and early high school, then out of the blue, my junior year, guys started wanting to date me, it was a total shock to me. I guess I grew into my fat cheeks. I desperately seek someone who will tell me I'm beautiful even if I'm not the perfect blonde hair, blue eyed, tan, sorority girl. I often feel as though I was born in the wrong generation. I am so into doing things for yourself and not for others, yet I care deeply about our environment and the human race. I listen to bands who were inspired by the ORGNAME ORGNAME, and the only time I truly feel like I fit in is when I am at a Widespread Panic or String Cheese concert surrounded by a ton of free-spirits. Everyone is so loving and accepting at those events (partly because they are on so many drugs they don't know the difference but also because they were like me, they were the ones who got teased in middle school. It took me a long time to stop caring what other people think about me. I mean, I take care of myself, I bathe and everything, and I take pride in my own appearance yet I don't let anyone elses opinions guide my decisions. Wow stream of conciousness writing is hurting my fingers. If I get carpal tundral syndrome I know who to blame, pennebaker!  Eh I suppose if I was going to get it I would have gotten it a long time ago. I am stuffed. Really wonder if purging isnt so bad after all. Well I think I will save that for when I don't have stiches in my mouth. I just got my wisdom teeth removed. hurt like hell. Actually it hurt worse when they were growing in, the first week of college.  
__label__label0 Well, let's see, what am I thinking and feeling?  My thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. I guess what's really on my mind is this PROPNAMEy and this week. It's been really, really stressful. The only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. The week did not start off well, as I lost a really cushy job, and it was just because I procrastanated and that made if even worse. Then, I got an interview, off campus 00 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and I had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so I was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where I was supposed to go and was freaking out. I could have cried. Right before I was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance I called back a lady that I had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. It  was my dream job but I was sure it would already be gone. Just my luck though, I impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and I got the job!  It was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. So things got better after that but today things were just shit. One of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. My other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. I cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and I hate drama. I guess I can't complain though, my job is great. I love working with art. The lady I'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. There were just a lot of jobs cut though and I feel really bad for her because I know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. But my other co-worker is really funny and I like her a lot but I'm really sad that she might be going away soon to LOCNAME, D. C. Everyone  else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. Let's see what else. Oh yeah, of course boy troubles. Boys suck, that's all there is to it. Sometimes, I wish they would all just die. Or at least those that suck. Not my friend da PROPNAME though. I love him. He e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :)  Also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. Know what I really need?  A break from all people. I just want to be alone. I want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. I want to go to a dig in LOCNAME and get away from everything. I hate feeling I owe something to other's feelings. I guess I'm just tired. The minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. I guess I'm just tired of that. It would just be great to start all over again, but I know that I can't regret the past and that I learn from everything I do. I have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, I mean I have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if I do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. In the end, I guess it's worth it because I know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. It's just what you have to put up with. I only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. Well, I'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but I'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :) 
__label__label1 I just came back to my dorm from Hobby Lobby. I went there with my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME to get crafts and other supplies for our Nothing Books. Nothing Books are like scrapbooks, and we have to make them for our sorority, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I think it's a really cute way ORGNAME making sure we remember our pledge term. Rush week was maybe the most hectic week of my entire life. First of all, we got to LOCNAME on move-in day, and we spent all day, I mean all day long moving into ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was crazy! We took a break to eORGNAME lunch, but the day was insane. Everyone moving in with their boxes and crates, and the move-in equipment that was supplied was hardly efficient. So that night, we started rush, after all that mess. I was so tired and worn out, I could barely walk to the meeting. The rest of that night is kind of a blur; I think I came back to Towers after the meeting and went straight to bed. The rest of the week we had to dress up. The events got more and more dressy each day, and I could swear that the weather got hotter and hotter each day. I think I probably sweat more in those 0 days than I ever have. ever! It was honestly just gross. Really, the whole process of Sorority Rush at this university is ridiculous. I guess I am being a hypocrite, but when you think about it, some sororities will cut you without even getting to know you at all. You think they like you, and they're cheering in your face like they love you, saying all kinds of things, like   we hope to see you tomorrow  , and the next thing you know, they've cut you. I guess I am making it sound like it's an awful experience, when in reality it really wasn't so bad. There were some very entertaining events during rush. My favorite was probably Skit Night, where we were allowed to go back to a maximum of five houses, and at each house they performed their own unique skit to try to get us to come back to their house the next night for Pref Night. Pref Night was probably the most emotional night of the whole week. All of the seniors in the sororities were crying, either because they were excited to get new members the next day, or because they were sad to be leaving. It could have been a combination of both. Immediately after we went to our last three houses that night, we were on complete   silence  . We could not speak to anyone, not our friends, our families, not even people that weren't rushing. It was supposed to be our chance to think about the entire week and to make a decision based on only our personal feelings as to which sorority we wanted to be in. We went back to our group meeting areas for the last time, and we ranked our choices. It was not very hard for me, because I pretty much knew which one I wanted to be in. However, there were tons of girls crying that night, torn over what they should do. I am just glad I was not in that position. That next day was Bid Day, where everyone found out what sorority they actually got into. There was even more crying that day. All around me, girls were screaming and crying, because some of them hadn't gotten into their first choice sorority, and some were just so happy with their bids that they couldn't contain themselves I guess. It was crazy! I was very happy, and when I got out of the building and saw that all of my friends had also been put into my sorority, I was even more ecstatic. Our pledge class is made up of 00 diverse girls who each contribute something different to the sorority. I know I am going to love being in LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. What I don't know is how I am ever going to balance being in a sorority, making good grades in my ORGNAME, Chemistry, Psychology, and Hebrew classes, and partying at this extremely social school. Not to say that I am a real party girl, but I like to go to all the events, and it gets very difficult to stay on track with everything coming at you from different directions all at once. I am glad that I live at Towers with almost all of my friends, because it gives me a chance to not only be with all of them, but also to meet new people. I didn't know my roommate before I came here, and I have met so many people on my hall, or at different sorority and fraternity parties. I like everyone I meet, but I guess at a school with 00,000 students you can't go wrong. I know I made the right choice by going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. It has everything I could want in a college and more. I love it here!! And I especially love my styrofoam orange longhorn ears that I got at the co-op when I was visiting during orientation. 
__label__label0      I thnik that after this I'll do my chemistry homework and get it out the way. It will probably take me forever eventhough it's only 00 questions because I still need to read. My Incubius CD is ending. I need to ask PROPNAME to start it again. I am wonder how I'm going to really learn how to speak Latin. I know I'll be able to read and Write it. When is my computer going to come in?  I feel like I'm intruding on PROPNAME everytime I use her lap top. I'm drawing a blank. Get up PROPNAME. I'm never good at this stream of thought stuff cause I'm always thinking about the stream of thought like in english class last year when Mrs. PROPNAME asked us to do it for. . I guess it was ten minutes. I miss her. I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME's doing right now. Probably out somewhere in LOCNAME. I love this song. I really want to play guitar. I hope I make the band next year. That dream was wierd last night or this morning or something like that. Singing would be so often for a living. I've always liked being on the go constantly. I'm so organized and yet never organized enough. I wanna' here my song again. That's so wierd, when one song is on you can't think of another on. Those girls next door were really loud earlier today. What were they doing?  I don't dress up very much. I still don't understand how people can where heels to an amusement park. Six Flags was fun this summer. I love this song. I'd love to see them live. I wonder what there like in person. He has such an amazing voice.  I wonder how my voice would improve if I were to take lessons. I need to exercise more. That would definitly improve my lung capcity and my playing. I'm so upset I didn't make the band. I'm proud of myself though because I sightread music while everyone else had had their music for a whie. What am I going to play next year for an audition. I don't know. I need to practice again. Is my music here?  I need to send the pool key to my mom. I also need to find a church before my mom kills me. I want to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Maybe we'll go sometime this week. I don't know. How much time left. Okay. Um. I did a really. times up. 
__label__label0      oh my gosh, my body hrts so bad. every time i move its like my muscles are tearing, crying out for me to stop. man, im hungry too. can't wait for kaye to get done with her class so we can go eat. i don't know how much good that is cause i don't like the food in the cafeteria anyway. oh well. the sun is so bright today- wlking around campus was really hot, but when there was a breeze, it was definitely nice. i saw some really cute squirrels out by the water fountain, and i wish i could have stopped to watch them, but i had to get to class on time. man, try outs are so hard. i don't kow if i can keep up with teveryone else for the next few weeks. it will be hard. especially now, until we get to start rowing. then i know i can show people up and do my best. classes are getting harder. there is always reading, reading, reading. it nevere ends. some of it i love while some of it drags so much when i try to read it. math is surprisingly understandable, so i feel confidnet that i will do well in that class. oh, im nervous about tryouts. i bet kate won't continue with them, she seemed to not be doing as well last night with the body circuits. i will push her a lot today at practice. mabey that will motivate her to keep working hard. so hungry!  only 0 hor until i can eat. i miss emma, more than everyone else in my family. she is always so funny, and cute. i know she is doing well in her school but i want to be there to see her and talk to her about it. can't wait to go home and see everyone. my parents seem so happy about me rowing. this reminds them of crosscountry. i miss anne and hallie too. everything beautiful is far away. the yellow flowers stephanie gave me are beautiful. i love them so much. my room feels more homey now, and yellow brightens it up a lot. i don't know what to do about simon. he frustrates me a lot, wether i show it or not. guess ill just try not to think bout it for awhile, and see what happens. no use in thinkng about it, it only makes me upset. matisse's art work is so beautiful. . i can't wait til we talk about him in art history. the figures he cuts out catch my attention so much. why did ross call last night so late. woke me up, couldnt go back to sleep. ended up oversleeping for 0 am class. but test went ok, glad i studies yesterday and did not wait until this morning to tackle the job. would have regretted that a lot, and done poorly on the test. i want to find some new music to listen to. something that is not mellow, omething with energy. ohhhh. im so sore it hurts to type. my family looks so happy in this picture. awwww. everyone is smiling so genuinely, its not one of those posed pics where everyone is forcinf a smile, ot just smiling for the sake of the camera. only one more class left today. and then its the weekend. will be nice to relax. have to get through running tonight, but i don't mind that, kind of looking forward o it. get to see the boats for the first time too. i hope kates mom is doing ok, i havent seen her in so long. i should tell my mom to go visit her, they gt along well. i like it when our renst hang out together, esp our dads. joey is so funny. i didnt realize how great of a person i had right under my nose for so long until he left. i hope he comes home from germany and doesnt like it too much out there, even though that is selfish to think. we all miss him too much- his upbeat personality and sincerity towards life. hope he comes home for christmas, or sometime soon. this weekend is goign to be busy, i should make a to do list so i can get all my homework done. the week days are so busy its hard to get everything done by the dead lines. i hope my mom sends me a letter from emma soon. she said she made me someting last tie i talked to her on the phone. my dorm is annoying me again, they want everyone to be so involved with everyone else, going to movies together, and eating dinner together all the time. i don't like it at all. i think i can only really push myself to be social and meet new people for the imes that i am out on campus. and when i come home to my dorm, i want to be by myself, not cnstantly hanging out with other people. i feel bad to an extent, because i know the ras put a lot of time into organizing that kind of stuff. but that is just not sometihg i am interested. 0 hours until practice time again. ohhhh. but then i have the whole weekend to relax. 
__label__label1 Today is September 00th. It's kind of strange. Everyone is hurring to get to parades and festivities to remember this significant tragic event. Where am I?  I am in a friend's dorm doing a writing assignment for professor PROPNAME. This is kind of hard because I have no idea what else to write. September 00th is just the number one thing on many people's mind right now, since it is 0/00. I really don't know how to feel. I'm saddened of course, but a little tired of all the   ground zero   footage. It it's so sad, why do they keep airing it over and over and over and over again?  It makes me more sad to watch it. I haven't been able to watch T. V. all afternoon because of it. I don't know what else to write. I wonder how i'm going to get this stain off of my white star wars T-shirt. I was trying to unwrap a passion fruit starburst with my mouth only, and it sliped out of my mouth. Weird. My roomate and I tried to see who could unwrap it the fasted. It was sort of a tie, because neither of use could get the wrapper off. I wonder if they lit the tower up yet. It's supposed to be red, white and blue tonight. My foot kind of itches from a mosquito bite i recieved earlier today. I need to put something cold on it. I don't like PROPNAME PROPNAME too much. Her music is kind of weak. She has nice shoes though. I guess she couldn't be all that bad since millions of people mindlessly buy her records and posters like my friend who has it religiously taged up on his wall. He, like every other teenage boy ranging from the ages 00-00 adores her. She's not that bad. Oh man, I've only been typing for nine minutes and 00 seconds and I can't think of anything else to write. This is the longest 00 minutes of my life. We used to free write like this in a rhetoric class I was taking at my highschool. I was taking it for dual credit with a local university. We used to write for 00 minutes strait without stopping. My teacher was a nice 00 year old woman who sounded like a 00 year old. Her voice was so soothing, sometimes. I hear this whisling or hissing sound coming from the bathroom down the hall and a couple of guys laughing outside the door. I can't stop writing. Let's see, what to write about. I think I'll write about my day. Today I was late for Chemistry. again. Our teacher is this French woman who has the thickest accent. She's sweet though. After that I headed back to Jester West to grab a Freshen's smoothie. I got strawberry shooter. It was pretty good. A little icy. This guy behind me asked what i recomended, and I said the pina colider or the the passion fruit. I like passion fruit, but not as much as I like pineapple. I didn't really enjoy the strawberry shooter because it had to many seeds in it. After that i headed to my History of Rock and Roll class. I love that class. All we do really is read and listen to blues, jazz and Tin Pan Alley music. It's really fun. I came home at about 0:00 from class and fell right asleep, them watched queen of the damned. That movie has a good sound track to it. Some of the songs that were in the movie were not in the sound track. That was weird. Wow,only three minutes to go. It kind of seemed interminable at the beginning, but now it's not that hard. I guess it's easier to just think rather than to think about what you're thinking. What is that called?  Oh, yeah. metacognition. I learned that in my rhetoric class also. THinking about your thinking. Only 00seconds left. I guess I'll write my name for the remaining time. Wait there is no time.      
__label__label1 Ok rigt now Iam a little unsure of what exactly I should be writing. I am trying to concentrate on this assignment while my roomate is getting ready to leave. The only thing I can hear is the soungd of her opening drawers, people talking in the hall, and the refridgerator sound. Before i started writting this I just finished my last class of the week and now it is offically the weekend. Suddenly I feel the stress of the week almost evaporating from me. Even though I know the weekend will be packed and probably just as stressful it seems easier. Right now my room is very cold. After I finish this assignment I will be packing for a retreat and calling my parents to speak to them before I leave. The fact that I will be on LOCNAME LOCNAME all day tomarrow excites me. Austin is georgous and I can't wait to see the LOCNAME. My roomate just left the room. She went to play racketball with her friends. My roomate and I get along very well and for that I am very grateful. It would be hard to live the whole year with someone you did not like. I actually like my whole hall I live in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the 0th floor. The girls in my hall are all fun and we seem to hang out with each other. Eww I hope PROPNAME locked the door when she left because a stocker has been spotted on my floor. I've talked to a few girl who said they have had encounters with him. They said he knocked on their door and asked if he could hang out with them while he waites on his friend. There are pictures up on the walls of him everywhere saying to not approach him if they see him. Last night the police were outside of our dorm and I think it was because of him. My hand is starting to hurt. Yesterday I feel flat on my face and scraped up my hand. It was actually kind of funny. My friend and I were racing to get in line for OU tickets and i triped and slid to the ground with only my hands stopping my face from hitting it. Everyone standing in line saw me. Yesterday was also my brother's birthday. He turned 00! -which seems crazy to me. 00 seems so much older than 00. It's crazy how time flies so fast. I can remember when me and my brother were young and just played all day. I wish I could have seen him yesterday but I had class and he's at LOCNAME. Since were only 00 minutes away it seems like we've grown closer.         
__label__label1 I don't have too much on my mind right now, and if im worrying about anything, it may be about classes. This class in particular is not too troublesome, but this is my first year in college, and im noticing that the style of school is in many ways different. And its not that i don't think i will be able to adapt, but i am a little intimidated. The laid-back style of college allows for a lot of distractions and freedom. So i believe that if i set a pattern now to get everything that i need done, i will be much better off.   Not only, are the classes here different, but my whole social life has been turned upside down. I don't know whether i should  let go of most of my old acquaintences from high school, and dive right into new friendships. or to hang on to the people who i feel know me the best. I loved my high school years. I loved the people i grew close to, i loved the environment, i loved the things i was involved in. And now, i don't have any of those things to comfort me. I loved theatre, i remember all the plays i was in and all the fun times and great bonds i made with people. Including the director. He was like my second father, someone i could really talk to, but also someone who taught me a lot about myself. And the things he taught me really can't be put into words, but rather they can be applied to my life right now. I feel so much more grown up after growing close to him in 0 years and feel like if he believes in me, there is no reason for me not to. That may be my one biggest flaw. At times i have somewhat low self-esteem. Well, to refine that statement, i doubt myself and my worth at times. Never at a dangerous level, im not anywhere near depressed, but i do tend to put others before myself. I care so much about people in my life, and i expect the same from others. But that isnt the way it is most of the time. I put my heart out there, and often it gets passed over.   And on that subject, that is the main reason why i broke things off with my high school boyfriend. There were other contributing factors, but this past summer, i finally put myself before him and realized that i wasnt getting what i wanted out of the 0 month old relationship. I loved him so much, and deep down, i know he loved me, and still does. but he didnt try hard enough. And he says now he realizes that he didnt treat me as good as he should have, and i knew that he would eventually see that, that is why i broke it off--to make it obvious something was wrong. And it took him a long time to see that. We were best friends, and maybe that is why it took me so long to say something. Because i had so much faith in someone so close to me, i was sure i was exaggerating things, being selfish. But after enough people telling you that you deserve better, it really starts to make you think. I would always be the one putting forth the effort, i would always aplologize, i would always go out of my way for him, i would compliment him, etc. And ultimately, he wanted an easy relationship. He didnt want to have to make me feel special, even if he felt it deep down. And now he tells me this. and its very unlike him to see that he was insensitive for so long. He usually doesnt see things like that clearly. But maybe losing a girlfriend and best friend made him see things differently. I miss him though. I was the one who made this decision, i should be strong and not rely on him. But i miss him and talking on the computer to him everyday while he's at ORGNAME lets me see the guy that i fell in love with. . especially because he is so nice to me lately. He claims that he's going to wait around for me, and that we will end up together again someday, but im not as sure as he is. I mean, i would love to be his girlfriend if he could treat me better. but we are so far apart, it seems silly of gaining a title of being a girlfriend, but being just as lonely. I need to be on my own for this new experience i am going through, and not attatched to his arm. I need to see who else is out there, this is college for goodness sake. But no matter who i meet, i will always compare them to him. I never thought of it that way, but he was my first love. Its weird to imagine that i really was in love, i never thought it could happen. But its very obvious that it was love. But for now i have to be strong, and just keep on the way things are. no matter how much i miss him. Because i don't want to get hurt again, not yet, not this far away. Im afraid things will just go back to the way they were, and i'll be 00 times more lonely. And its hard enough to meet friends here, there are so many people- i don't need to make it harder by being cooped up in my room all day talking to my boyfriend miles away. This school is funny like that. There are almost too many people to make friends. Everyone is doing their own thing, and its really easy to get sucked into hanging out with your old high school friends and not make new friends. But thats not what i came here for. I came here to meet new people, new open minded people, and have new experiences. and to redefine who i am as a person and a friend. But that doesnt mean i have to cut old ties alltogether. hmm. i wonder if its been 00 minutes yet. i think so. 
__label__label1      I feel tired and sleepy. I feel that I just want to go to sleep right now. I feel this assignment is making me sleepier. I also feel pain in my stomach and want to do something about it. I feel that I just want to get up go to sleep. I feel that this assignment is boring and really unnecessary. I feel like my stomach is going to explode. I also feel a little stress because of all the things that I want to accomplish today with the little time to do it. I feel that this assignment is never going to end and that my thoughts are just blank right now. I want to get up and go do the things that are really important. My body aches from moving around too much. My stomach still feels like it's going to explode and I can't do anything about it. I'm thinking that I want to call my sister see how everything is going. I talked to her yesterday and it made feel good because I have been feeling kind of homesick and depressed. She is like my life advisor because she is always helping me out with stuff. I feel like I've through a whole semester of school work and I just want to take a vacation and relax and play basketball all day long. Playing basketball is the only thing lately that makes feel good. I play a lot but I get tired quick so I can't always play to my full potential. Sometimes I just don't want to do anything else during the day so I could just play basketball I work on my game. I wish that I could play all day long and never have to worry about anything else. Right now I'm thinking if the major I chose is the right one for me. I don't know if I'm cut out for business. Sometimes I feel like I want to devote my time to writing screenplays and playing basketball. I feel like the whole world is holding me back from doing so. Sometimes I feel like doing something drastic and just drop out of school and live in southern LOCNAME, a place that I absolutely love. I also wish I could transfer out of here. I never really wanted to be here. There's too many people with far different attitudes and goals than mine. I wish I was attending college in the northeast, but I would only pursue that if I were sure what I want my major to be. I don't a like a whole lot of things here now that I think about it. I was hoping my attitude about this stupid school would change once I got here but it hasn't. I knew I was going to feel depressed when I came here and that's exactly how I feel. Things are moving too slow and I want them to move fast. I'm impatient right now because I feel I have been patient for too long. Having an anti-social, computer nerd for a roommate doesn't help much either. His attitude and introvertedness sometime irritates me. I wish I had a different roommate. I feel that school screwed me with this. Now I feel that I really wish that I could transfer. I just want to be in a better environment, hopefully somewhere I could find people like me.   
__label__label1 Today I woke up feeling completely gross and sick!I knew it was a mistake to go out and party last night when I knew I was coming down with something but I couldn't stay in my dorm room for another second~! My roomate is already driving me crazy and I am sick and tired of all men! where do they get off thinking they can use me and other women at there disposal. Does ben really think his life is so much more important than mine or more difficult because he is going to med school. His life  could be a lot more rough! Aah, what was I thinking he's not really even my type I don't have time for another boyfriend/heartbreak! How could he sit there and tell me I am the perfect woman for him but just not right now! Like I am supposed to sit around on my ass and wait for him, I don't think so. Gosh there is so much to do this weekend. Laundry, homework, visit with PROPNAME, suck up to my Dad and if that's not enough we had to add being sick and on my period to the list! Like I don't have enough to deal with. I wonder If PROPNAME is ever going to quit smoking, you think that the prospect of having children would be enough to make her quit but it's not. I wonder why thats the case. HOw can smoking be that addictive that it can stop you from bringing another human llife in to the world? I wonder why she started smoking in the first place. It will be cool when she has kids of her own to see what they turn out to be like? I wonder if I'll be there cool Aunt PROPNAME, I kind of like the sound of that! I'm still typing away in my dorm room it feels like such a sauna in here. Our suitmates our constantly turning off the air. What's wrong with them? Do they like to sweat. My roomate is such a rotten brat! It's so obvious she is an only child suffering from   only child syndrome  . She acts and talks to me like I'm her mother/maid. Oh well, I won't be seeing to much of her starting next week. Swim lessons start, and I'll be really busy studying and working. I still have a lot of reading to do for my children's literature class. It's such a fun class. Getting a grade for reading childrens books! The teacher cracks me up you can definetly tell she used to be a librarian. When she danced the other day in class I thought I would exploded! So my times almost up and I feel like I am rambling now, and my hands are begining to hurt. I'm not used to all of this typeing! I should probably call the woman at the ORGNAME after this I have been meening to do that and just haven't gotten around to it! Gosh so many thigs to do!                                 
__label__label0      I really want to wear my new clothes tomorrow, especially my   pretty pink shirt but it goes really well with my new skirt so I want to   wear them together but i don't want to wear my skirt tomorrow   because it might rain and I don't want to get it all dirty. So may be I   will wear my red shirt tomorrow and the skirt the day after depending   on the weather. Or I could wear the pink shirt tomorrow and the red   shirt on tuesday and the denim one on friday or saturday then I can   wear the pink shirt again on next tuesday and I'll wear the skirt with   it. I don't know what I'll wear wednesday, maybe I'll borrow   something from PROPNAME. I can't wait until I turn 00 next month then I'll   be able to go clubbin on friday and saturday nights and  I won't have   to hang out with PROPNAME and PROPNAME' losery friends all the time and go   to there   parties   that really suck. I want to dance and get all freaky   on the dance floor like back home. Then PROPNAME can come visit or I'll   go to san Antonio and we can party. He is such an amazing dancer,   and so sexy, we would have so much fun. Hopefully I will get lots of   money for my birthday and I will be able to buy lots of cute clothes   and look even sexier than I arePROPNAMEy do!  I can't wait for my birthday. I   geuss I will celebrate it the week before with my parents when I go   home for the Homecoming game, and maybe I'll go tothe dance with   PROPNAME. Then on my actual bday weekend PROPNAME and jonny will   come up and I will party with them at some club or something and   maybe they will get a hotel room so I wonthave to sneak them into   my dorm room late at night because that may not work so well.   Then the next week PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME are definatly coming up   and we will have good times. I guess we could say that nikki is   PROPNAME and i'll register PROPNAME ad PROPNAME as my guests or we could just   hav a big slumber party at hanh's apartment. Speaking of slumber   parties, crystal and PROPNAME want to come visit for my bday weekend   also and I don't quite Know how that will work out with brandon and   jonny coming.      
__label__label1 I needed to do something other than re-write re-writing a paper for   my freshman seminar. Yes, although the new IMac was the   #0   computer for college students,   it has already failed me twice. I   wrote the first copy of my paper yesterday, this morning I dragged   myself in after a long Saturday night to continue where I left off. The   screen was frozen, and my half-way written paper was beyond the   reachable distance between me and my computer screen. My words   are lost in the motherboard of this machine. And then it happened   again. I rewrote the paper, without a harsh-word. In fact, my second   copy was much more to my liking. It made more sense and fit   together. And then I wondered how long my paper was. I have this   tendancy to write in extra small font and single spacing so I'll   surprize myself at how much I've written when i allow myself the   viewing pleasure. When I hit the   paragraph   button, the   application   unexpectedly quit.  This time I allowed myself a splur of profanity   and allowed myself to make a few phone calls, since I'd had such   bad luck I might as well run the long-distance up as well. But since   no one wanted to talk to me, I turned back to the Imac. Not for my   damn paper on the film Matewan again. No, not yet. But for my psych   paper. With my luck this paper will also get lost in the matrix of the   unknown. Those unimaginable invisble power lines, where my   thoughts, words, and fonts flow to any other computer connected to   this wired (and now wireless) world. Now I'm all caught up in these   thoughts about the   deep unknown.  I've confused myself, my study   of psychology and science isn't deep enough for thoughts that   sometimes cross my mind. I should stick to the petty crush I have on   my RA and practicing for my dance tryout tonight. While psychology   is something that really does interest me, I'm not sure why. It's   classified as a science. The science of the mind, I've done my   readings. But I hate science. I hate math. In fact they're my worst   nightmare. Numbers and equations jumble up in my head and I   don't really care about the anatomy of ants or why the sun is so   bright. It just is. I can settle for that. Asking something any deeper is   frightening. No, it's not my   thing.  My thing? That would be visual   performance and art. Specifically, design. The word excites me.  Creation and design could be seen as similar. One could be a   science and one and art, or one in the same. But the science aspect   doesn't thrill me. It's the art. The color and the comfort. I love to   watch, to look, and to experience. Not to calculate. Maybe it's   shallow-that I won't to the shit work. But what's shit work to me is a   dream come true to another. My time runs out and my mind races   too fast to type my thoughts. If my writing is as confusing as it's   made me feel, I blame it on the techno music that my roommate is   blaring. Maybe the IMac doesn't like the music.   
__label__label1      Ok so im sitting right now in my dorm room writing my first ever college assignment. College is not at all what I expected. Its pretty much highschool except you don't have to attend your class and theres no curfue. My dorm has been asssigned (some might call it imprisoned) in Jester. Its quite a new experience. I awoke last night at exactly 0:00am to find my neighbor blasting rap music. Now I am not one for rap music and especially not at night. Not knowing what to do I layed there in misery and ignored the 000 decibal speaker system which I was dreaming about smashing. Now that I think about it next time this happens i'm marching right over and banging his door down. College is such extreme independance in my life that at times I cannot handle it. Back in highschool I had a midnight curfew, now I can come in at 0 am and no one can say anything. I can eat cookies and chips and never eat actual food and theres no one to stop me . But this is not the reason I came to college. I was not escaping my parents, I came to LOCNAME because my views and beliefs are shunned and immoral according to my smal texas Baptist town. I remember recieving an F on an English paper in which we were told to write about our feelings and my feelings were inapprpriate. How can someones beliefs be inapropriate? UT is the most liberal college in LOCNAME and even though I can barely afford it to me being exposed to different views and being able to share my views on life without being blacklisted are worth every student loan I have to take out. Now I do not know what I am   not allowed   to type in a college paper. Am I allowed to tell you that I am an aethiest? Am I allowed to tell you that I loathe culture. Well whether I am or not I do not care anymore. I cannot stay trapped inside and never know if others share my views. Its a horrible feeling to not be able to speak out. Its the worst kind of hell anyone can go through.  I cannot express even to myself how much i find people who have religous beliefs stupid and ignorant. Religion is a sorce of comfort for the idiot and a powerful tool for a leader. Anyone with the slightest bit of common sense can see that the three main religions in the world , Christianity , PROPNAME, and Islam are almost identical and yet they all are an excuse for war and money. Religion is bullshit, its all a story made up my a power hungry man who proclaimed himself the son of god to gain a following. If others are allowed to express their love for God then it is not wrong for me to express my hatred of him.  I look forward to this class and intend to make the most of understanding the stupidity of some human pysche. Even though im an engineering major I find this subject interesting and intend on embedding what i learn in this coure in my mind for the rest of my life. 
__label__label1      I've been thinking about relationships lately. As we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. Im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. This new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. It's something new and I like it, but I can't help but still have feelings for my ex. I think the reason is because I was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. And I think that keeps me tied to her in a way. And the problem is when I'm with this new girl, I'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason I can not get aroused, if you nkow what I mean. It's not that I don't want to, because I do, but for some reason I'm just not able to. I wonder why this is? Why can't I just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. Is it me? What can I do to fix the problem? Should I just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? Or will this be a chronic thing? Im in a bind because I don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. I don't want her to think I'm not attracted to her. God, I can't wait to see her! She lives in LOCNAME still, she's a year younger, so I can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. And she has already taken advantage of me when I was drunk. Should I tell this new girl this? What good would it do? I'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me I definitley wouldn't lie to her. When I broke up with my ex I wanted to be free, I mean I was going to college and I wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. But then just a week after we broke up, I found her!! And she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. She likes me how I am, but I like to try and impress her as much as I can. I find myself spending  a lot of moeny on her! Plus, I'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but I definitley want it for her because I know she would like to see me with more muscles. She's so beautiful! Her face pops up in my head everyday. I see her face on everyone I meet! Am I in love again? I hope not. I don't want to fall in love with someone I can't be with do to where we live. That would hurt too much. I have to be close to the person i love. So I will not let myself fall in love again. I can't let it happen. But I'm afraid it will, I know she is falling in love with me, but I got to hold back. I got to be strong. I can't wait till I go back in town in october. I'm taking her out to a haunted house, I love them , she hates them. Meaning she will be clinging to me like white on bread. I love when she puts her arms around me. I love when we're fooling around she takes my shirt off. She's very aggressive. . . god I love that. An aggressive woman is very attractive in my eyes, a woman who will take control is somethign rare, and she posesses it. I so want to get more physical with her, but I'm afraid because you see, she's a virgin. . . I'm not. I don't want to steal her innocence. She's so sweet and innocent, I don't want to corrupt that, especially when I don't know if there is a definite future for she and I. What do I do? I think she wants to have sex because of all the signals she gives me when we're fooling around but I'm not too sure. Do I go ahead and go for it? Or will that just make me fall in love with her, which I stated before I didn't want to do. Man, she makes me so jealous! I have never been jealous, but for some reason she makes me. I guess it might be because I'm not there with her, and i know she hangs out with all these guys, and osmetimes its just her and a guy. That pisses me off, I mean I trust her, but one of the guys she hangs out with is an ex-boyfriend of hers, who makes it very clear that he is still madly in love with her. So how am I suppsoe to take that? god!! I wish I wasn't jealous, I mean she and I are just dating and I'm already this jealous. I was never this jealous in my entire previous relationship. She makes me so happy though. She can do nothing wrong! She is my everything and I think about her constantly! I think I love her! 
__label__label1 tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. I've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as I've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.  
__label__label1 So I'm in the room with 0 guys and another girl and they're having this conversation that's really distracting me. Not to worry, I'll soon be engulfed in my own stream of consciousness and I'm sure this will turn out really funny. Actually, right now I'm laughing because they were making fun of my job. Haha. Alright, back to business. This is one of my favorite things to do. My friend just distracted me by trying to read this. Anyway, work was long and boring today. Lots of restlessnes and paranoia. Haha, the people in the room are being really funny. This guy is telling a really descriptive story (which is how I tell stories) and the other guy is all like,   get to the point!    I'm avoiding trying to read what I just wrote so that I can move on to the next paragraph. Everyone thinks its funny that I'm taking this so seriously. Its really hard to concentrate!!  PROPNAME, why do people fall for people who are already in relationships?  And why do I think I actually have a chance?  I think I have a really big chance. But I don't have long term goals. Hmm. I enjoy anticipation and a challenge, and that's what the person I have a crush on is to me. Its really exciting. It got quiet all of a sudden. Funny how that happens. I like it. I like the awkwardness. Uh oh, they're talking about sex now!  Got to love college kids. Ahhh!  So, my throat is dry, I'm about to grab a beer. And I'm one of those who actually like beer for the taste of it. Just call me a beer enthusiast. I'm not even sure if I spelled that correctly. You know, I won the spelling bee in 0th grade. And in 0th grade, I lost because I got the word   condemn   and I spelled it c-o-n-d-o-m. And I didn't understand why the judges were laughing until 0 years later. Anyway, I have 0 and a half minutes left and the person I have a crush on hasn't called yet. She's supposed to come over and play Battleship with me and my friends. I really wish she could break free from her controlling boyfriend. But I'm not one to judge her relationship since I was the controlling figure in my last relationship. ::sigh::  Lets not talk about my last relationship, I'll go to that bad place in my head. No regrets, no regrets. Alright, so I am really tempted to call her now. Umm, how is this computer going to organize my thoughts?  Haha, I work for a computer company. Actually, the biggest computer company in probably the world right now. But that's not really important. Not saying that my thoughts aren't important because I believe everything I say or think has some huge significance. Even if I can't understand them. I don't even know if that made sense. Its hot in here. I hate laptops. PROPNAME just told his roomate to grab me a beer. I should tell them to call PROPNAME to get her to come over here. Sometimes people need a little push out the door, know what I mean?  I wonder if these pants look too big on me, they're really comfortable. My nostrils are flaring. People think its cute. I am done. Ok, maybe not. I have to keep going for like 0 minutes. My friends are making small talk. Small talk is funny. Ahh yes, a beer. Except I don't like drinking out of cans. Why is that?  I love bottles. And PROPNAME PROPNAME. I take after my father. But then again, I love white zinfandel, which is my mother's favorite wine. Woah, its almost 0:00 and she still hasn't called yet. I'm getting upset. Maybe a little obsessed. I make myself laugh. Now I'm listening to them talk about me. I like the attention. Count down. 
__label__label0      As ORGNAME now I wonder what will become of me at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. These first few weeks have opened up many new experiences to me. Being able to make decisions by myself and not have to worry what my parents think is weird to me. My dad was the principal at the same high school as me which limited me to what I could and couldn't do due to the fact that he had a reputation to uphold in the community. Back in my home town people would associate me with my dad and hold me to different standards than everyone else at the school, but in college I don't have to worry about my fathers reputation and I can be the person that I really want to be. This is strange because my whole life I have had to worry what other people think of me, but these last few weeks my whole life style has changed. It is strange living away from my home town because many of my friends are there and I have lived there all of my life. I am sure I am going through the same things many other freshman are going through right now. Having to meet new friends and find my place in LOCNAME is harder than I thought, but at the same time I like ORGNAME a lot more than I like my hometown. My roommate is cool and it seems like we will get along fine over the year. I was worried that I would get a bad roommate because I have heard so many horror stories about bad roommates, but I guess it turns out that I was lucky. I can't wait for the next UT football game. I missed the first one against LOCNAME LOCNAME but I have my ticket for the one against LOCNAME. Many of the people that I already know up here are going to be tailgating and have invited me to go with them to the game. Hopefully during this time I will get to see some of my ex-neighbors that I grew up with. The television is starting to get on my nervous because some dumb movie is playing and this monkey keeps making stupid noises. I find it hard to try and write for 00 minutes straight. To follow my thoughts is hard because it seems I try to hide them even from myself. I think this might be due to the fact I could never say what I thought when I was growing up. I always had to follow the   norm   and if I didn't my parents would scold me and tell me not to think that way. Since my parents both come from a more traditional up-bringing I don't have as many experiences as other kids have had.    
__label__label1      I actually have free time for once in my life! I'm never alone in my dorm because i'm always with my friend PROPNAME. Wow this is so weird.

BYE!!!!!!!!!! 
__label__label1      Today has been totally stressful!! Actually this past week has been stressful! College is very different from highschool. In high school I never even had to study, but I would still make high A's in all my classes! Now. . im not really prepared for all this studying i have to do in college! arg!  Im pretty sure i can handle it, but im still freaking out over only taking 0 tests in each class the whole semester! and those two tests determine my grade. . thats just scary!  Anyways, today in general has been stressful. My mom had to go get an MRI today, and that can't be good. Shes been ok the past few weeks, but something is making her sick! and today also, i found out that my uncles lung cancer is back, we thought it had gone into remission, but no, it came back. This has been really hard for my grandmother because she has to take care of my uncle 00-0. And my grandmother is not in that good health either, but hopefully she can handle all this. And it scares me because my other uncle, also smokes! even though his brother is literally deteriorating before his eyes! but he still won't stop smoking. that really pisses me off! its just so gross and. . blah. Oh well, he has to make that decision on his own, i can't make it for him. Anyways continuing on, one of my roomates is gettin on my nerves. I have 0 roomates in total, and we get along pretty good, but this one roomate, ahh! shes annoying! shes always trying to tell me that im not doing something right! and its always stupid stuff! like, she told me i wasnt cracking the eggs correctly?! or that my grammar on my english paper is wrong, when i know its right! and the thing that makes me mad is i didnt even want her to be my roomate. You see, i got a housing scholarship, for gettin good grades, so i don't have to live on campus. Two of my other roomates got one also. The girl i don't like happened to be a recepient also. She totally butted in and said she wanted to live with me! what could i say?! noo?! of course not! so i said yes. Then during the summer i was hoping she would forget and not transfer her lease over to mine, but what do you know! on moving day, guess whose face i see right as i enter my apartment door, none other than the annoying girl! ahh! this is something that is making my life even more stressful right now too!  Sometimes i wish my parents could just tell me how to live my life, it would just make everything sooo much easier on everyone!  But i guess thats the college life, its just very new to me still. Like, i enjoy not having my parents there telling me to study, or when my curfew is, but i do miss that   parental aspect   that i used to have in my life. College has a bunch of pluses. and minuses. Its not all parties and having fun like some people. Well i guess it is for some people, but personally not all that much for me. (Thats another thing about my roomate. . she is always partying! like 0 days out of the week! thats overdoing it just a tad don't ya think?!?)  But anyways i guess i should write something about the psych class to get some brownie points. lol. I really like that class! its pretty interesting, and the professor is pretty cool and not so boring(like my history teacher who says. . and umm. . alot!!)Im thinking of changing my major to nursing, possibly to become a psychiatric nurse, or possibly a pediatrics nurse. but im not sure(once again. . something i wish the parents could decide for me)  But yea, that class is pretty fun, i just wish it wasnt such a big class! thats another scary thing about college, your just a number! your just a tiny little fishy in a huuuge sea of other fishies!i guess its just cause im straight out of highschool where the classes are only 00 students each. Going from 00, to 000, thats quite a bit of a difference, and it can be rather intimidating for a freshman!  But i guess i will have to learn how to deal with it sooner or later!! hopefully i can survive this year, my goal GPA is atleast a 0. 0 ATLEAST! ahh!! i would like to have higher than that. . but we will just have to wait and see won't we!! 
__label__label1 Well this is the first time that I have ever been told to write for twenty minutes straight about what is going on inside of my head. Anyways, yeah it is early in the morning and I just got back from calculus, and I am extremley tired. The reason that I am tired is because I did not get a lot of sleep this weekend. I really wanted to catch up on my sleep but it did not really happen. The reason for this is, that on Saturday night I did not go to bed until like four or five in the morning and then I needed to wake up semi-early to do some necessary homework. I really am a night person and I do not ever mind staying up late even when I have to wake up early the next morning. Well anyways, school has been its usual self. I am really enjoying the college life and the freedom from my parents, but I miss all of my friends so much. I really wish we had more vacation time so that I could spend it with my friends. The person that I miss the most, is of course my sister. We have grown up our whole lives together, and now that she is actually maturing and becoming a normal person, I am not there to see it and it is kind of sad. Anyways, also I miss PROPNAME a lot. I mean I realized how good of friends we were, but since we have both gone to college, I realize it even more. He is the one that can always put me in a good mood when I am upset. He can always make me feel so much better about myself. I can never get mad at the kid, even if he says the rudest things or the most inconciderate things. He is a great friend and someone that I will always want to be in touch with. I mean saturday night we talked on the phone for like four hours. I mean that is a lot of talking. I never thought I could talk on the phone that much, but with him the conversation is never boring, never worthless, never repetitive. It is always something new and great to hear. Yeah we have our moments where we say somethings to each other that normally if anyone else said that stuff we would get really angry, but we know that we really do not mean it, and that we are really good friends. Well enough about him, he already occupies enough of my time. Twenty minutes is a really long time to type, considering that the first time I did this my computer like froze or something when I pushed the finish button, which really made me mad. Well I also have this other friend named PROPNAME, whom I have known since like sixth grade and have like since sixth grade. He goes to school here and we hang out a lot, but he has a girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME, whom I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon. We had open door night last night, and our room won cutest runner up. I do not know who won cutest overall, but we were happy with what we got. It is finally about to come to and end and my hands are in a lot of pain and will be relieved when they do not have to type anymore. Well less than thirty seconds and it is all over. I am way pumped over here.  
__label__label1 I wish polygamy was still legal. Well, not polygamy, but i wish i could take more than one girl to texas OU weekend.  i have like 0 or 0 girls that i would enjoy taking,k and who are all expecting me to take them, but no matter what i do, i am going to piss like 0 girls off. It kind of sucks. I am glad that i can at least take one date, but it is a complicated matter when it comes to toying with peoples, especially girl's emotions. I think i have pretty much decided on who i am going to ask, but i heard that she has a boyfriend, so im not sure about it any more. While this kind of makes me angry, i guess it helps me out in deciding who i am going to ask. I don't even know, there is a girl who lives down the hall from me, and is actually in this class. I am sure it will all work out anyway.    I guess when it comes down to it i am lucky to even be here. ( at LOCNAME ). A subject that occupies my mind a lot of the time is what happened to me this summer. Basically i went out to fraternity rush party, had way to much to drink. I wish to God someone had been there to take away my keys, but no one was, and i got in my car, drove the wrong way and ended up putting my car into a lake. When i say putting, i mean a 00mph plunge down a boat ramp. I realize that i have almost died and i have spent many hours dwelling on what happend, what could have happened, and thank God, where i am now. The only real problem is how i live now. Any other person would have sworn off drinking for good, but i continue to do it, even though i told my parents i wouldn't. This makes me feel guilty, and upset. I don't really know what im going to do about the whole situation, but i am determined to make my parents realize that i am as responsible as ever, and not to disappoint them.   I miss my dog like crazy, which is weird, cause i don't really miss my parents that much. I guess its because i can talk to my parents, but i can't call my dog and see how hes doing. I wish i could have my dog here with me, cause he really is my best friend. I love dogs, they never smart off to you, and they don't stay mad at you.     I love college life, fraternity life, and everything else, i just hope that i don't get too bogged down with partying, and stuff, that ill be to busy to study and do well.               
__label__label0 Okay, well,  I am watching the movie XXX"  I'm not really watching it because I'm typing, but I'm listening to it. I really can't type that well, so there are probably going to be a few misspelled words. My sister made me mad a while ago because I asked her to call me when her husband got home and she didn't. I looked outside because they live next door to me and his truck was there. I was like "Okay, why hasn't she called me?"  Oh well, whatever. Oh, I don't know what to do. My friend hooked me up with her friend PROPNAME. He is really nice, but I feel bad being with him because I'm still in love with my ex boyfriend PROPNAME. Well, my friend PROPNAME told me that PROPNAME already loves me. That's not cool because we've only been together for like 0 days. I love PROPNAME so much!  I don't know. Man, I just heard somebody. I hope it wasn't my mom. She is always bothering me. We really don't get along. I came home and my room was a little rearranged. I know that my mom was in my room. She was probably looking through my things. That's not even cool because I had a letter by my bed that had some very personal things written in there. I'm pretty damn sure that my mom read it. She is always going through my things. I think that I probably should've lived on campus or maybe got an apartment. She is always yelling at me like if I'm a little kid. I need to get a cell phone because she is always getting mad because people are calling me. She gets mad when she doesn't recognize their name. She comes and asks me "Who's so and so?"  She also gets mad because my friends call me late. They call me at like 0 or 0 on the morning. I tell them they can call me late though. Anyway, I need a cellular. Ah, I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. He wants to buy me a cell phone, a ring and send a dozen of roses to my house. I know that's sweet, but I don't like for guys to buy me things, especially not expensive stuff, but I do need a cell phone. I don't know. I miss PROPNAME. We were supposed to get married. He told me that he loved me and would never leave me or break up with me, but he did. He had our life planned out. He knew what kind of cars we were going to have, how many kids we were going to have and what our house was going to look like. I hate it, because I don't even know why we broke up. He gave me all of these excuses, but I knew they weren't true. I later found out, like a whole year later, that two stupid girls broke us up because they were jealous that we were together. They probably liked him and wanted him for themselves. That's another thing that bothers me. If it was because of a good reason, then I would understand, but they made him believe that I cheated on him. I loved him so much and would never have done that to him. I don't understand why he believed them anyway. If he had any doubts, he should've asked me if it was true instead of just believing them. 
__label__label1 I love this song so much. well, actually I love the band. Our Lady Peace, where did they come up with this name? It doesn't matter but it's just a question. I can't help but think back to freshman year of high school and remember the times that these songs remind me of. those were good times. ahh, well times change and new things come along. geeze, I'm so hungry. I can't wait to go eat with mom and dad. They are so great. I can't believe how much money they've spent on me and sam for college so far. wow, that's a lot and I'm so lucky. this next song is so good. I love this whole cd. music is such a great thing to have. it expresses feelings that you can relate to and it is a great way to relax. school is so different. I don't know what to study and there is so much reading. I feel so overwhelmed. oh, the football is is tomorrow. I'm so excited about it. they better win. and the red sox I hope will keep on winning. I want them so badly to go to the playoffs, even if they are the wildcard. they deserve it. isn't it funny how you come to like something? for example, how I became to like the redsox. I know I came to like them because of michael. it's funny how you like something or show interest in something that the person your dating likes. I couldn't help but like them because he did and it gave us something to talk about and be interested in. I like the redsox now and it came from him. he is such a great person. I can't believe we've been together for this long. almost 0 years is such a long time, but it has been great. he is sweet, funny, kind, nice, beautiful and he makes me feel good. He is my best friend. I can't wait to go get my pedicure today with PROPNAME. It will be good to see her and spend time with her, she is such a sweet girl and is always willing to talk to me. it's weird not seeing all my friends from high school. I miss them so much. I can't PROPNAME had a baby! She is such a great mom and everything, but she is missing out on so much not being able to go to ORGNAME or ORGNAME ORGNAME's like she wanted to. I'm glad she is determined to still take classes at ORGNAME though. She is making the best out of her situation and I'm so proud of her. And PROPNAME, her baby. What a beautiful baby! I love her so much. I can't wait until she can play and talk. I want to play with her and just be able to have fun with her. I want to spoil her even though she isn't my baby. I'm getting so tired just sitting down. I want to do something, maybe, vacuum the room. It's getting kind of dirty. I want to eat! I miss my animals. I want them to live with me here in the dorm. I love petting them and giving them attention. I'm glad I went home yesterday. Even though I go home at least once a week, I miss being there. I miss my brother, parents, and the animals. PROPNAME is so funny. He has no one to play with or antagonize. He tries to wrestle with mom and she can tell that he misses us. This is the best song on this cd. It is so pretty. 
__label__label0 I am so upset with myself today. I am so far behind on my study god I hope I don't fail. I don't want to fail my mom. She would be so disappointed in me. I can't do that to her. Class isn't what I thought it would be. And all the reading god, it is so annoying. PROPNAME is pissing me off so much. You would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and PROPNAME out of her life. No she has to come down every weekend and steal PROPNAME away and get drunk. Oh man that is so fun. Yeah right. I mean PROPNAME is my friend too. I can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 0:00 every night. Then you got homework and early classes. God I just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without PROPNAME calling every ten minutes. You have to share PROPNAME, PROPNAME. My roommate PROPNAME is really cool. She has a great outlook on life. She takes things as they go. I wish I was more like that instead of worrying about everything I do and what people will say. I mean being a girl at ORGNAME you have to look pretty to get a guy. So number 0 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. Next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. And why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. Sorry I'm not into that. I can have fun without that stuff. PROPNAME has this guy she is in to. Supposedly he is a charming jerk. He lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. That is all she talks about. I wish I could find a guy too so we could trade stories. Me and PROPNAME are not from LOCNAME and decided to drive around today to the mall. Boy was that stupid. I was so scared I thought we would never find our way back. God I can't get over the fact PROPNAME would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. I think I will tell her to stay in LOCNAME and make her own friends, I mean I made mine. I am so bummed. I keep thinking I am going to fail out of college. My brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. He was salutatorian in high school and I was only 0th. I am afraid I won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. I mean I have a Kinesiology major. That is a joke to everyone I know. I haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid I have a test or quiz tomorrow. I am going to have to cram. I just don't want to fail. I am so scared about this. I know I will fail if I don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. I'm too lazy and tired of school. I just want to go out to the Real World" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. It would be a lot more easier. I figure if I just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is I don't have any concentration in me. I feel like I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). I really don't but it feels like it because I lack so much energy and motivation. I hope school is okay tomorrow because I do not want to have a bad day. I hate bad days they make me sad. 
__label__label1 Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, PROPNAME. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 000 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss ORGNAME ORGNAME much. Just some of the people I left behind, PROPNAME included. Things change, I went down to watch a ORGNAME LOCNAME football game last week. It was against our border rivals PROPNAME PROPNAME. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 00. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 00 in their place too. Good old? PROPNAME PROPNAME, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 0 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together. It's a Tex-Mex term from LOCNAME Pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. I'll tell you more about the origin another day. Oh yeah ORGNAME suck. Come on pull it together men! Win one for the gipper, do something. The team played horribly in the second half. Hope they do better next week on Monday Night Football. Man this is crazy. My foot itches, damn athlete's foot. Should get something for it. Typing late at night is fun. I need to go download the new Obie Trice Album, too bad its only on PROPNAME right now and I can't get it yet. In due time I suppose. I still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. My roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. I'm glad I'm not taking any science course this semester. Life is good though. Small problems aside I don't have much to complain about other than Calculus, but I'll be fine with it. 
__label__label0 Today I had a fairly busy day I believe as I am feeling a bit tired right now. I wonder what time it is. Oh it's 0:00 P. M. right now so I guess I can continue writing this assignment. HaHa I'm just kidding. I feel good about myself right now because earlier today I helped somebody out who needed it. She is my sister's friend, I guess an acquaintance for me, and one of the tires on her car got a flat. She and my sister both didn't know what to do, so my sister called me and I came and fixed her tire for her. After that she bought my sister and me dinner as a way to say thanks. I feel better now than I used to about a week and a half ago because I tried out for the marching band here but I didn't make it. I was really depressed for a day or two because I've been involved with band for the past seven years of my life in high school and middle school. But after awhile I began to realize a few of the benefits of not being in band. For example, I don't have to buy those stupid white plastic shoes all the members are required to wear so I can save some money. Also I have A LOT more free time than I've had in a long time. It feels really good to be able to take long naps in the middle of the day without having to worry about practice" at 0 P. M. in the evening and interrupting my sleep. Man, that timer on the top of the screen is going really slow. It says it has only been eight minutes but it feels like twenty already. My wrists are beginning to hurt. I want to listen to music on my computer right now but I can't because my roommate is on his cell phone talking to his friend and I know my music will only bother him. We don't share the same taste in music. In fact, I think we are as far as possible in our tastes in that category. I think these chairs they give us for our dorms are very uncomfortable. I mean, they're completely wooden with no cushioning at all. You would think that in the honors dorm we would get special treatment of some kind, but so far I think we are being treated the exact same way as the freshmen who are going to drop out at the end of the semester. It's hard to concentrate right now because I usually need music to help me concentrate. I like the upbeat kind of music that has a constant bass drum playing really loudly on all of the down beats. I also like classical music and music that has drums and stringed instruments at the same time. I'm not sure what the kind of music is called, though. However, I don't like oldies or country music at all. In fact, I hate that kind of music. That's why my roommate and I don't share the same tastes. He likes that kind of music. I just heard somebody running down the hall of my floor at a really high rate. I wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 0:00P. M. Maybe he was running to get more beer for the party. Just kidding again. No need to get investigators up here or anything. But earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people, so something was definitely going on. I was thinking about emailing that DJ guy for our class. I don't remember his name, though. I have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class, and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and doesn't think he is. He thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him. OK! I only have one minute left. After this, I think I'm going to get ready for bed because all this PROPNAME PROPNAME type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy. I think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than I thought I was when I first started typing this. 
__label__label0 It is really really very very cold in my room. I do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. I am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. I am glad I brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one ORGNAME those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww I just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. I wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all I have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn't all that fun. I need to borrow duct tape so I can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is COLD. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe I should figure out the whole bus system so I can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and I do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs I would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time I am done this I will go work out for awhile. but then I will have to take another shower. don't know if it is worth that. because then I will also have to dry my hair and I hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and I am sticking to it because I hate putting makeup on. it's a pain. a waste of time, if  you will. the cd stopped. I should put another one on. now I'm going to have 'yo's a ho' stuck in my head. it's not a bad song just not a song I would like to have stuck in my head. I always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it's weird. I don't know where they come from. last night I had a dream that I was yelling at erin. in someone's driveway- until she walked out on the street. I am unsure of what we were yelling about but I don't think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. I have an itch on my leg. it's itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn't a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 0000. I don't like it. I mean, these people are all almost 00 years old. and they are ORGNAME of ORGNAME - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms'. I definitely could not live like that. I don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it's a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 000 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 00 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates. BRRRR my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. I need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don't ever talk to them it's really a shame. I need to clean the water filter pitcher so I can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 0 glasses of coffee a day. I don't drink any caffeine. I did one day and I was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. I don't understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up?  on tv people always say lets go get coffee" or "we need some coffee" and it's always after some traumatic event or really late at night. I think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. I guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? I wonder why andy called this morning. I called him back twice and he didn't answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of "I am a. d. d. " doesn't really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. I would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. I wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 0/0 of a ". "  well I am going to end this the way I started it. it is really really very very cold in here. 
__label__label1 wow, this might be interesting. my hands are sticky. there's crap underneath my fingernails from cooking soup last night and so now every time I bite my fingers it tastes weird. I have boogers. jacob is a funny guy. I got nothing. my nose is really itchy. heh- itchy and scratchy, the simpsons, vicky likes that show a lot. I wonder why her cell phone keeps hanging up. my chin itches. that's better. man, I need to clean. the set up of those empty cans looks phallic. I need to take a shower before class. I wonder if this party will be fun. I can't believe I'm awake this early. I'm hungry. those croutons were good. I have the ending song of Ebichu stuck in my head. ok- 00 minutes is a long time. neil forgot his glasses. it's wayne's world wayne's world, party time, excellent. -guitar sounds-. ok boogers are getting on my nerves. my hand needed to be scratched. what's with all the itching? there goes my eyebrow. I should remember to use my mp0 player when I go to class. man I need to get my tags renewed. I almost spelt renewed wrong. miguel never called me back, the turd. I'm glad I got a job. I hope I enjoy working there. man, I can't wait for the matrix revisited to come out. I'm going to ask off work on that day. It might be neil's birthday. I don't know what I'm going to get him. hey my birthday is in like a week. haha, like a week, meatwad- miguel, jerk who didn't call but I love him anyway. god the floor's dirty. I wish the cat didn't knock crap over. I hate that feeling where you know there's a hair on you, but you can't find it, so it just keeps touching you and annoying the crap out of you. I should go laundry. jesus christ, that song isn't even in english- so why is it stuck in my head? this is kind of like a live journal- except cooler, because it's not all hey everyone read what I think but don't get mad or think I'm weird" I think those are pointless. I always thought a journal was private- but I guess I was wrong. "you got me all emotional, chu chu chu chu yeaaaaaaaaaaaah" damn song. man disneyland was hella fun. I hope I make it in life. otherwise. I just might get bored and do something I hate. I miss all my friends from the bluff. I've known them forever. also- they worshipped me. but mostly I miss being able to say, remember when jeremy fell out of his chair in third grade?! I like running into people I know. PROPNAME was so nice to walk me to class. I should call him sometime and see how his school is going. He is so sweet. Too many drugs, but sweet, and he has a good body. damn the hormones. and now the other eye brow itches, I need to tame these bad boys. haha- shake your tail feathers, asians shake it for jeet-san. niiiice. dude that asian guy was hot in jester. I wish I could suppress all that stupid physical crap. -yawn- I'm not tired, I think I'm just hungry. oh my god, 0 minutes left. YAY! neil should fix the computer, it looks ugly without it's case on. I'm going to wear my sexy jeans today and my ninja turtle shirt, only because they are both bad ass. I miss the old cartoon. I miss my childhood. I bet my mom's lonely. I wonder if she got rid of the ants. they were in attack mode. it was like a bad horror movie from years gone. the baby kitten is asleep. I love her, when she does not bite me. I need to work out. I want to have a killer body. I want someone to stop and look at me and go- jesus christ she is hot. too bad I look 00. I need to send my mom that grades thing. I do not know why. oh yeah the safe drivers insurance. OHHH I'm going to send her the tags thing too, yeah. I should call first. she might get mad if I just send that to her. I like popping my toes. oh lord here comes gavin. I knew I couldn't get through this without him talking to me. that's ok, I deserve it, I shouldn't lead the poor boy on, but what can I say, I like the attention. 00 secs. sweeeeeeeeet. 
__label__label0 A picture of my girlfriend PROPNAME sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. She is beautiful in many ways. Her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. I'll tell her that next time I talk to her. My cousin PROPNAME is getting married in October. He is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. When I asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. It should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. It'll be awesome. The wedding will be a lot of fun. I'll dance with PROPNAME and such. And I'll have all my family there. Well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. Too big. 00 first cousins, etc. I remember when my sister got married. Good times. I got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. My uncle (PROPNAME's dad) took a cool digital picture. My feet are cold. I'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because I don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. PROPNAME, my roommate is playing guitar. He is playing a solo that we recorded on PROPNAME PROPNAME' recording. We recorded and collaborated with PROPNAME. Good times. I hope he is happy with it. I'll ask him next time I'm in LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME is wonderful. I can't wait to see her next month. I hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. It should. And then I'll be able to embrace her like I did this past summer. What an amazing summer, all because I loved her like I should. Honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. We're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. Everything is willing. Everyday I see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. But PROPNAME and I are so far past that. And we both know it. And we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. I love her. I'm proud of that because I know I love better than most if you even call what most do love. PROPNAME and I are working on a new song. It's going to rock. PROPNAME, you're distracting me. Half over. 0:00 am. I need to read, but I'll do that tomorrow. He is still playing the guitar. He is asking me musical questions but I am busy. Stream of Consciousness! Yay. Homework. ORGNAME for school. Yahoo for me. *shrugs*" - billy madison. Great movie. I have it memorized and I recited it in front of PROPNAME in 0th grade when he challenged that I couldn't recite it. Good times. I wonder how PROPNAME's doing. He is probably smoking or drinking right now. What an admirable class president. PROPNAME was student body president. good guy. I'll see him on american idol one of these days. My neck itches and I scratched it. My calves are cold now. *stretching calves*  mmm. cow. Reminds me of steak. Yum. I could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools*  "Mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime" - homer simpson. It would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if I wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. But if I were a local vigilante, I'd hang out on Speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and I'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. "Bicycle dismount zone, punk!" heh. That's be cool. Then they would get up and beat me up. I remember when I use to spend the night at PROPNAME's house back in 0th,0th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. I never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time I saw one of those. they were  
__label__label0 Okay. This is weird. I don't like assignments like this one. I'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all I find is nothing really. Seems like deep down I am pretty reserved. Well, actually I know that I am so this is not a surprising. Anyways, there it is . nothing. PROPNAME just got home. She is my sister. She had swim team practice. I think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. Does that make sense? Working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. I bet you wondering why I am expressing myself so badly. It has to do with the fact that English is not my native language. I am German. My real family is still in LOCNAME. So PROPNAME is not my real sister. She is part of the family I am staying with. Now I am going blank again. Let's talk about the family I am staying with then. They are very kind. After all, they aren't charging me anything. Why? That's a longer story. I think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. There isn't anything wrong with her. It's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. The funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. And I am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. But it's true. From what I understand you can blame that on her childhood. Her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. Well, it was her they got. Accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. Well, you can derive your own implications. Anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. It goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. Even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. She goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. Anyway, I should be talking about myself. I have my own problems. I can't state my feelings. That is as far as I will go because I can't talk about it. Then it can't be cured. Irony. Now I am thinking about UT. It's pretty overwhelming. In LOCNAME my High School graduating class had about 00 people. Yup. But I will do fine. I am just having these high expectations in college. I want to find my dead poet society" - teacher. Someone that will point me in the right direction. That makes learning an adventure. Right now, I still have to force myself to do homework. Time is up!   
__label__label0 Laughing, sad, wondering why?  Failed dreams, friends, lost. Can't seem to get away from people. Why do people change, what happens later on?  Help. Everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards. People never grow up, promises are never kept. Life goes on, right?  Learn to live with people. Learn to get along with those who don't attempt to get along with you. What have they sacrificed yet?  Does anything matter except themselves?  Sometimes you just need someone to talk to. To let understand where you're coming from. Does anyone see what's happening?  How long until everything's back to normal again?  How long until I can trust? What went wrong?  Somewhere, I lost the truth, reason, my smile, yet still I hurt and cry and need. I love this boy. But why is he the only one that provides comfort. It can't be healthy, can it?  How come no one else seems adequate anymore?  Life has to keep moving doesn't it?  But why do things work out this way. What happens in the future?  Where does all of this lead?  questions, questions, questions  I feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me. College changes people, and some people grow, yet some people stay right where they were to begin with. Why don't people understand, or listen, or care?  Overwhelmed, just overwhelmed. Things haven't clicked" yet  Lonely very lonely, need someone to talk to, really talk to and not just over the phone every night, not someone who knows who you are, or someone who cares about you, just someone who will listen and then talk back. who doesn't care if you drink this weekend, and won't judge you by your mistakes or jealousy, or stupidity, or friends. Why do people always compare you to your friends can't you just be you, you don't have to have the same values as your friends, the same beliefs, or the same morals, yet people always seem to worry about you when it's one of your friends who screwed up. hate disgust disapproval attention  I need a hug, I just need to be held while I vent or cry, I need to cry to let everything out, but then I read that venting isn't proven to be healthy, but was it proven to be unhealthy?  And yet vitamins supposedly don't help you but they make you feel better, so can't I vent and cry just so I feel better?  Why don't people change? Do I have a one track mind/   why do I care so much. Maybe I'm the one who needs to change, maybe I need to try out what's bothering me so much, but maybe I don't. I want my own bed, I want my privacy,  is it too much to ask for her stuff not to be thrown on my bed all the time, can't she set it on hers so that I don't have to move it in order to go to sleep, and if you come in at one in the morning and the lights are off, don't leave them on when you leave five minutes later, especially when someone's sleeping. I'm hurt, I feel hurt, and betrayed and I question a lot now, because I used to think that I knew who she was, she used to be a really close friend that I could talk to about anything, yet now all I see is someone in need of constant attention. so how do I know who any of my friends are?  Or my boyfriend?  DO I really know who he is/?  I think I do. but what if something goes wrong?  And I lose him, my best friend, also. what if he gets tired of listening to me, and gets tired of my friends or finds someone else, or gets tired of having to support me?  I'm high maintenance but is that bad, and not in the fashion that I like gifts, I don't really, I just like being held and talked to and spoiled I guess you call it  I really don't know where it all comes from I just expect more in a best friend so that it's harder to live up to so that there's less a change of being hurt or quit on or left behind, or scared or in love, but what is love anyway? 
__label__label1 well, I don't exactly know why I'm doing this, but I do enjoy the idea of trying to figure out what's in this head of mine. PROPNAME's checking her email, but she will be leaving soon to go get a bagel. I'm not that hungry because I had a huge breakfast. there are a lot of people in this library. I wish I had internet connection at home because it would be so convenient. I wonder what my parents are doing right now. I wonder if their business is doing well. I wonder when they will be able to retire. I wonder when God will essentially allow them to stop working. God works in mysterious ways, and that's what makes him God I suppose. I'm really glad I got to talk to PROPNAME last night online. He is a nice guy. I got to talk to carol too, but really didn't have much to say, which is not surprising. there's a lot of interesting different people here at LOCNAME. such a contrast from LOCNAME LOCNAME, where everyone wants to be popular and only buys the best things in life. but are the things they think are the best really the best? don't think so. I miss home, but I really do enjoy it here at austin. I haven't been homesick at all, which might be a good thing or a bad thing. I feel like I abuse my parents so much, verbally. I don't ever take into consideration the fact that they have feelings too. I just say whatever to them and never think clearly. in a sense it is good to be comfortable with people, but being completely immune to their well-being is not good at all. why am I such a malicious person? I think sometimes being malicious on purpose might be better than being malicious without even thinking, because then that means that being malicious has become second nature. I really need to work out more often. I've gotten so freaking lazy, and as a result, fatter, or ?healthy? as my parents call it. why am I so frugal, actually it shouldn't even be considered frugality because it's to the point of stinginess, like scrooge. I don't get it. I try to not think about how much money I spend, but I get so greedy and selfish. I seriously think that if food wasn't so essential to life I would probably not eat and horde money all day. why God? actually I shouldn't be questioning you. I'm sorry. it's my fault. I am just an evil person. that's it. we are all just naturally evil. well, that sounds too Hobbes-like. we do have good in us, but we are all sinners no doubt. but I seem like my sins all go unnoticed because I do them so often and I don't realize it anymore. I've got 00 minutes left on this. shar's going to the restroom. I have so much reading to do. and sometimes I feel like I read and read and read and study, but then when I get to class I feel like I did nothing at all. wow, 00 minutes is a pretty long time. not when watching television or a movie. I guess time does fly when you're having fun. I wonder who thought that one up. I haven't seen a movie in the theater in awhile. I wish there was a dollar theater close by. I wish I could get a job. I wish I could manage my time better. I should really take into account opportunity costs of everything I do or buy. sometimes I wish I was more economically conscious but then I feel like sometimes I'm too economically conscious. I do too many things for my own good. I never think about other people. instead, I think how much of my own money, energy, etc. is going into making someone else happy. that's so wrong. man, I have psych in about an hour. I wonder what we will talk about. I wonder if I read enough. I wonder how my first quiz in college will be like tomorrow. I really need to stop eating so much and work out more. I cannot possibly rationalize all my eating by my walking to and from school everyday. 0 more minutes. I wonder what God thinks of me. maybe I shouldn't wonder. what else is there to say? I feel like my brain has been racked and pried. is that how you spell the past tense of pry? I have so much reading to do. did I mention that? by the time I get home, I will probably be so tired. but I need to read. shar's going to her echo meeting so I will be home alone with no internet access. man I am so spoiled. as early as 0-0 years ago I didn't depend so highly on technology. but look at me now. well, I guess we should look at ourselves now. what to say? I wonder what my parents think of me. I think too much about what other people think of me. I need to stop and think about what I think about myself. I thought that girl looked familiar. hmm. I'm almost done dude. almost done. only 0 minute left. I have written a lot. well at least I feel like it. now that I'm almost done I feel like the 00 minutes went by really fast. so I guess this was both enriching and entertaining to see what's in my brain. 00 seconds. done! 
__label__label1 Well I'm sitting here wondering why I have to do this assignment. Should I type     correctly, capitalizing words. I don't normally when I chat on I'M or email someone. I really wonder if I'm ever going to get that song I'm practicing on the guitar. It's so     hard to hear the parts because there are so many other instruments, namely the     piano which is really getting in the way. Maybe I should try something simpler. but I get so bored with the simple stuff. I wonder if I can eventually get a PROPNAME     PROPNAME song or get to the point where I can just play something cool and everyone     recognizes it. Will I ever lead worship at a church? Who knows. I don't really think     that's my thing. there are so many cool people that do that already. In fact, I loved     Friday night worship at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really want to go back. I don't know     if Hope in the City is the church that the Lord wants me at, but I really like it. I love     how everyone is so friendly and genuine -- the worship is passionate, and I love     that. I walk in and go, this is how Christians SHOULD be. " not like the majority of     churches you walk into and see all the little cliques of friends, most of which are     too comfortable and exclusive to open up to a new type of person or just a person     in general. however, I know that there are some really cool places in LOCNAME that I     want to try: The LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. who knows. Oh, EV Free. Oh, I     saw court rode today. Man I love that girl. I hate that it's sometimes a struggle to     talk to her though. It's cool if we talk about the general stuff, but not normal enough     to just say whatever or something stupid because we haven't spent much time together. I mean, she is really cool, but she is a senior and has her own stuff, and I doubt that     she would ever just want to hang out with me. However, I should give myself some     credit -- I mean, she has called me and invited me to places (church, a cook-out. ),     so maybe she is interested in introducing me to some cool people. Cool people --     I'm finding some but still missing Steph and PROPNAME back home. Man I love them,     too. They're great. I miss being so comfortable with someone that you can just do     or say whatever's on your mind. or if nothing, you don't have to say anything, and     it's totally fine. I wonder how they're doing. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing in the     dorm, meeting new people, finding new good friends, like PROPNAME. I'm really     excited that PROPNAME is branching out and exploring ORGNAME, but I'm not ready for loss     of contact completely, and I don't think she is either. I think she wants to (as do I     and as does PROPNAME) "make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the     other gold. " I can deal with being silver, or bronze even, but I would like to keep a     place in her life. And man, I really want PROPNAME and I to stay the good friends     that we've become this summer. after PROPNAME's death. I love how she always     understood and felt the same way I felt. We agreed that we never knew what PROPNAME     was thinking but that we wanted to. PROPNAME -- man I miss her so much. Silver Taps     at ORGNAME is tonight, and I really want to drive back. I know I would miss Spanish in     the morning, but I just want to see my friends and talk about her and remember     her. I feel like things would be so different if she were still here: PROPNAME and I     would never have become as good of friends as we have because they would still be     hanging out all the time. They would still support and love me completely, of     course, but I think I would be more like PROPNAME -- really branching out and finding     new people. Plus, PROPNAME would have someone to chill with in LOCNAMEge LOCNAMEtion. PROPNAME is cool and all, but she has her own issues, and I really would like someone     there to keep PROPNAME accountable, to pay her the attention that she needs. because we all do! I would really like to find someone like me, but not too much,     and without a boyfriend (because the only cool girls I've found so far have boys. long-term boys, I think). I really want someone (a girl) that I can just play around     with -- be stupid and say stupid things, but also have fun and be silly. I want to be     able to plop down on her bed and either cry or laugh incredibly loud. Amazing, I     actually already have that. Do I need/want new friends other than camp friends     like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They love me so much and support me like crazy. They     like it when I'm around and like to spend time with me and hear about things with     me. especially PROPNAME. PROPNAME has got lots of other stuff that's she is doing --     which is cool -- but she just doesn't really have all the time for me. which I guess     sounds kinda selfish now that I've typed it out. But PROPNAME -- truly loving and     sincere and like a big sister. Just seeing her around campus encourages me and     makes me feel at ease. Not that I'm so uncomfortable here. I am SO GLAD that I     left College Station and A&M to come to LOCNAME and ORGNAME. What a blessing! this     place is amazing and fun and new and exciting but also is quickly becoming a     home. I find myself either almost getting lost or just finding new places or     directions or whatever to go around town, and I love it. I love being able to know     what street takes me somewhere else, or where my friends' houses are or where     to go shop or. whatever else. Friends' houses. the boys -- haven't talked to them,     want to see them. The girls -- looooved going over to their house the other night. I     got to chill with PROPNAME and tell her about school and life and etc while she shared     the same. PROPNAME and I also got to talk about Spirits and applications and all that jazz. Oh and I made it to the second round of the Texas Spirits app! Exciting. I can't     decide what I think about it though. I know who I am, and I just want to be myself,     but from what I hear and have seen, it might be like a sorority. Blah. I just don't     want to conform -- I want to be a part of something cool and unique but without     being stereotyped as something. I don't know. cookie-cutter, I guess. I hate that. I     want people to like me for who I am. stupid and crazy and silly and fun and smart     and perfectionist that likes crazy things and crazy music. crazy music -- ACL! And     PROPNAME is coming into town, and I just don't know what I think about that. Do I like     him? Does he like me? I have no idea. I don't think I'd ever date him. he is     younger and in Colle Sta and whatnot. But he is pretty great. I just have no idea. Ok well honestly I can't stop looking at the timer and how I have thirty seconds left. So I hope that I wasn't graded on capitalization or anything because I'm sure that I     messed up all over, but hey it's all good -- all we had to do was write this thing. I'm     confident. I'm happy. Class is cool. Don't want to take the tests 
__label__label1 Well here we go. I'm so tired I really don't feel like doing this. But I only have one day left so I guess it'll be good to get it over and done with. I haven't even started reading yet. I really need to start. God I'm hungry. I can't believe all I've eaten today is some bagel bites. I need to go hit up the grocery store tomorrow and stock up on some food. I'm so happy it's Thursday. This week dragged on for so long. It's probably because this was the first week where we had class on Monday. This music that I'm playing in the background is really effecting my stream of consciousness. I think I'll change the song to something more mellow because this song I'm listening to right now sucks. That's better. I wonder what's going on tonight. I think after I'm done typing up this paper I'll call up PROPNAME (my cousin). Whoa he just I'M'd me. That was weird. I should probably tell him that I'm working on something because I don't think I can do both things at once. I can't wait to go back home and visit. I've been feeling kind of homesick lately. I wonder what all my friends in LOCNAME are doing right now. Probably nothing. LOCNAME is so boring. I kind of need to go to the bathroom. But I have to finish typing this paper. I guess I have to wait. I think I'll go back to LOCNAME next week and see what's up with everybody. Man, my stomach's starting to feel all queasy. I should go eat something. I can't wait to DJ on that boat in a couple of weeks. I hope I don't get sick before then. Everyone's been getting sick lately. I slept a lot today. I need to go out and do something tonight now that I'm all rested up. There are way too many chairs in this room. Whoa my keyboard is vibrating. That felt weird. I wonder what's making it do that. It must be something outside. This CD I'm playing is so stupid. The song just finished and now I've been hearing crickets chirping in the background of the silent song for like two minutes. Awesome it's over. Man, the whole CD's over. I should put in a new one. I hate working in silence. Or wait a minute; I remember the stream of thought instruction thing saying that one of the things you should describe is what you hear. Right now all I hear is car's driving by from the outside of the balcony. That's pretty boring. I think I'll bump some 0Pac. When I go home for the weekend I need to make sure to stock up on some food. I think I need some soap too. Maybe I should make a list. Sweet, only six more minutes to go. This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm already almost finished. Why are my eyes so red. They've been red for like the past 0 days. I bet it's those stupid contact lenses. They're so crappy. I think I'm just going to have that Lasik eye surgery. I wonder if I spelt that right. I don't think it really matters. My stream of consciousness can't spell all that well. I think after this I'll look up the bus schedule so I won't have to walk half an hour to my class tomorrow. I hate walking that far. And I have flat feet too so all this walking is really starting to suck. I guess it's good for me. Only two minutes to go. Man, I keep on having to think of my stream of consciousness. Maybe that's a bad thing. I have a blank stream of consciousness. That can't be good. I guess it's better than those people who are constantly thinking. I bet I'd be really good at meditating since my mind goes blank so much. I wonder if there's any classes on that. I want to take that Kapawaya class. That'd be cool. I'd learn how to fight and break dance simultaneously. I don't see how they expect to teach you such a complex fighting style in 0 days. That's pretty stupid. I   
__label__label1 So here I am sitting at my computer. I am supposed to be doing my homework that I put off all week, I guess you could call this homework though. Its a little cold in here, I haven't taken a shower yet. I hope my roommate doesn't just come home and I'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. I wish I could go home to see my family and friends. but I don't have the money. I hate my job. I wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe I'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. I'm hungry and my feet are cold. I wonder why it is that whenever I get hungry I get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever I get cold I get hungry. I don't think the second floor dining opens until 0:00, if even that, I can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. I really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since I dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time I get them, or were sent earlier in the day. I should really take a shower, I feel sticky. I think its from the ice cream. I just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day I might think about that, but today I've got bigger things to worry about. I like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which I think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. I would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. I wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. I mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday I was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than I did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so I said something, and it wasn't even mean, I just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. I couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, I hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. I think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. I know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. I couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time I get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did I buy two packs of gum?  I went to ORGNAME yesterday and for whatever reason I bought two packs of gum. I don't' even chew gum that often. maybe I bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, I think she was catching the 0pm bus out of san antonio. I'm going home next weekend. I'm supposed to catch a bus at 0 and get to dallas at 0:00. I guess we'll have to make some stops because I've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 0 hours. but I probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. I told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on Friday, sat, or sundays because I didn't know when I was going out of town. and what did he do?  schedule me for this Friday. well I already bought the tickets and if I don't go home this weekend I'm going to go crazy. I miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. I miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. I got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. I don't talk to him anymore. I wonder if he even knows I'm here. samantha knows, I remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. I mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it I can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this?  it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and I haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me?  I don't know. well I should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening. 
__label__label1 well, here I am. writing this essay. ok sorry that was a bit corny. you know. well I just got done taking my first college test in chemistry. it wasn't too bad I guess. but the fact that I stayed you till 0:00 in the morning didn't help much. last night I went to a place called posse. it's a bar that a lot of the people in the band go to. I had a blast! of course I drove and so I had to drive back which wouldn't have been so bad except that it was raining last night. I have a C parking permit. yeah. it's the one that makes you park across the interstate. can you see me running across the interstate soaking wet? it wasn't too much fun. but I got here and got my materials, and started studying in my soaking wet clothes (I had to stay clothed cause I was in my hallway. my roommate was asleep and I didn't want to wake him up. ) I studied a bit, and then got kinda bored with it so I went and got my guitar and played it out in my hallway. I'm pretty sure I broke some rule about quiet hours, but it didn't seem to bother anyone. I was quiet and the songs were soft and pretty. I like to play guitar before I go to bed. it helps me wind down. actually I like to play the guitar anyways. it's such a chick magnet. I have gotten a lot of play just cause I can play the guitar. it's nice. and it's therapeutic. playing guitar that is. I would expect getting booty is pretty therapeutic in some way, but that's not what I'm talking about. it helps me with my problems. I'm not too sure how. well, I guess it just helps me express my emotions and get them out of my system. I like it anyways. I love music. not only listening to it, but performing it as well. I'm in the longhorn band! now that kicks total ass! I mean it's huge, it's a lot of fun, and we get into all the games for free! and actually, this is the best part, WE GET PAID TO GO TO THE OU GAME! YES, THAT'S RIGHT, THEY GIVE US MONEY TO GO TO THE OU GAME! I love thinking about that. all those poor kids with their bracelets. oh well. such is life. I love football too! and what better place to go than here! our football team kicks ass!@! ok. so I don't know where to go from here. hmm. I guess I could talk about how weird it is that when we're asked to think about anything the first thing we do is well, not really think. ya know? is that due to nervousness? is it just some bad habit that teenagers and adults of late have acquired? who knows. I was talking to a friend in your class and she said that she was going to have a hard time wetting this. I think this is pretty easy. I'm fairly scatterbrained so it's cool. I've been noticing this more and more lately. I know I don't have add or anything, but I find myself being absent minded every once in a while. I wonder if add is a real thing. I mean I never really disputed it, but I have friends that think that add is a problem of will power. but who knows. alright. 0 minutes left. what shall I write about for 0 minutes. I'm sure there are some other ramblings I could think of. I play the sax. yeah. I like it. my biology class sucks, both of them really. my 000 is better than my 000 but who cares. I guess I should learn to like them though cause biology is my major. I want to go premed. and become a surgeon. we'll see how that goes I guess. if I don't make it in that, I'll probably switch to music. it would be nice and a music degree from ORGNAME has literally a 000% job acceptance rate. that is no lie. and that's a really good deal. we have a great music program here. we also have an awesome social life here. there's always something to do and someone to talk to . ooooooooooohhhh! less than a minute! almost through! what should I write!?!?! I don't know! oh I know! I'll write about   
__label__label0 Well I'm sitting at my computer and I don't really have much to say. For some reason I feel as though my mind is completely blank. My roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. I am so tired right now. Last night I was up with no thoughts in my head. I was just not able to sleep for some reason. I really hope that this school year goes good for me. I know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. I have always dreamt of coming to college and now that I am finally here it still seems like a dream. I guess its just hard to believe that I'm on my own, six hours from home. I miss my old friends and my girlfriend, PROPNAME, I can't wait to see here this weekend. Football season is about to start and I am getting so excited to see my first Longhorn game. My mind just went blank again. no thoughts. I think I just used to many dots between words. My nose itches. I need to use the bathroom, but I still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and I don't want to stop now. For some reason it seems as though I have been here typing for a long time but really I haven't even typed much. Maybe I type slow. I'm trying to think of what to type now. It seems so easy. ?Just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe I'm trying to hard. The phone is ringing. I guess I'll get it. it is was my mom. Yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. That sounds good to me because I could really use it right now. It looks as though I have barely typed anything. I'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. Man I'm thirsty. I could use a spite or a cold coke. Maybe I'll go get one in a little while, or not cause I need to save money. It's tough not having a job and wanting so much. I'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that I don't even need in the first place. Six more minutes and I will be done. It actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. I wonder how my dog is doing. I hope my mom is feeding her just as I said, and giving her lots of water. She needs that especially in the hot sun. I can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. No thoughts. still none. I think I'm getting addicted to the dot thing. Two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. Every second seems to go by slower and slower now. I really don't want to drive home this weekend. I wish I could fly, but I'll be alright. I just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. Well it's been twenty minutes so I guess I'm done. 
__label__label0 Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment. At least its easy, right? Oh well. I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am I going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. I really like this new piebald cd. its happy. I hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. I think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. I need to read more. especially for school. I just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. I'm tired, I should go to sleep. but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no 
__label__label0 I just started playing the Smiths. I kind of consciously did that because I wanted to see how that would make me feel while doing this assignment. I think it would be pretty funny if I had put whilst on that last sentence instead of while. Anyways, I had to put it down now because I'm now conscious of the fact that I started listening to the Smiths so I could say I was listening to them whilst typing this. There I did it, I put whilst. I also kinda put the Smiths on here probably so that if someone reads this then they'll know     I listen to the Smiths. I do that a lot. I specific music whenever people around, I don't know, I guess so they'll think it's cool or something. I've been feeling really lonely recently. I was thinking about that because I wonder if anyone is going to read this, and if they do, if all this stuff being collected is going to be used so we can learn something about ourselves. I don't really want to hide anything, because I'd rather someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me, than type jive like, oh I don't know what to write, blah blah, school was fun today, because I feel really fucked up recently. I don't want things to change, this shit is so gay. Sorry, I know we're supposed to type thoughts but that's still pretty bad. I was happy this summer with a girlfriend and my friends around, but then we had to break up because she went away for college, and I freaked out on her which wasn't cool, but I was just really scared. Yes, this song is awesome. I should probably go to the mental health center, but I'm scared of the process of signing up for an appointment, probably more than actually telling someone something, because then I have to talk to real people and I'm not so good at that. That's why I'm really lonely lately, I don't know how to talk to people, and I'm meeting all these new people, and I have no idea what to say, so I just don't say anything. I'd kind of really like to meet some new people, because I hate sitting around my room all the time, even though that's all I do. I'm scared to like walk up and talk to someone though. It's quite a frightening experience, and I get all nervous when I'm around people. This typing is really hurting my shoulder because I'm on my laptop. Shit, I just hit the back button. Alright, I'm going to keep typing, but this is really gay, now I got to tack on another 00 minutes. Whoever reads this is probably going to be pissed that they have to read a 0/0 more than everyone else. Well, I better not get in trouble for it is all I can say. Speaking of gay, I called my girlfriend, I guess ex-girlfriend, because I want to keep in touch with her, and she told me about how she saw this guy with a Dashboard Confessional sticker and a Smiths sticker on his backpack, and she told me about how she and her new friend went up to him and asked him if he actually listened to good music or not, it being assumed that Dashboard Confession is pretty crappy, (and who's to blame that assumption, with lyrics like, Far away from all the stupid questions / 'Hey, did you get some' / Man that is so dumb") nonetheless, what the hell is she talking about, she didn't even know who the Smiths were until like a month ago when I told her about them, and I mean, I still think it's funny, but a lot of the music she is into now is from me. I don't know, I think I am just pissed off because she wanted to break up. But, it's perfectly reasonable, we're completely across the country,  I'm being ridiculous I know, it just ended so fast, and I'm still upset. Ahh, this isn't fair, I still have 00 minutes left because I hit back somehow, this is going to take forever. My shoulder is kind of starting to hurt, I think this is a really cool assignment, because it's just stream of consciousness, but it's taking forever, Agamemnon. That's what I say when I'm saying Aggh, or something, because it sounds cooler. I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend. I really think I have some sort of problem with dependence, I feel like I HAVE to be around people most of the time or I start to feel sort of depressed, like no one cares about me. This being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment, is making things worse. My History of the Banjo teacher, that's a freshman seminar, told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo, and it's driving me crazy, because     I hate semi-long nails, they always feel dirty, and I can feel them now whilst I type, clacking against the keys, it's irritating. I think there's something wrong with my smell, I don't think I can smell anything. That wouldn't be surprising anyways, I think there's something wrong with everything about me and everything I do. I always seem to fail at anything I try, I can get good grades, but I've been missing assignments in college already, which is just compounding things and making things worse. aggh, or I mean agamemnon. I keep looking at this scratch on my arm, where I cut myself with a razor. I don't think I'll do that again, I was feeling really depressed on Saturday, I didn't eat anything all weekend, and I normally regimen my meals very carefully, but I didn't eat anything, and feeling depressed and having read about self-injury, I wanted to try it, but cutting myself with a razor didn't feel particularly painful or punishing, and hardly seemed worth the effort involved, considering you have to clean up the blood, so I don't think I'll bother with that again. I can't even do that right. I've actually been feeling better the rest of this week, but I kinda want to talk to someone, just because I don't think there's any guarantee I won't feel like I did on Saturday again, and I felt terrible Saturday morning. That was until I did DXM, which of course made me realize that things will eventually work themselves out. I just wish I could manage to carry that feeling over into the real world, because not worrying about things is such a beautiful feeling. I think I worry too much, but I'm always sure that as soon as I get by myself no one's going to ever want to see me again and I'll be stuck like that. I wish I could meet some people here, but I don't know what to say. It's hard to just talk to someone, it's always boring conversation, and at the end, they always go their own way, and never want to do something with you again. No matter how good you try to make the conversation, they never seem to want to continue after that, despite reading constantly that the way to make friends is to simply talk to someone. Bullshit. 
__label__label1 I forgot that we were going to be timed, I wonder if we have to type well, I wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. This is kind of harder than I thought. So should I go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? Oh well, I don't think I will. I'll just keep going. I need to keep typing about something. I need to type what I'm feeling. I'm feeling a little stressed because I have to keep typing all this time. I wonder how long this should be, especially if I have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. It's only been three minutes. Geez! I thought this was going to be an easy assignment. Well, it is relatively easy. It's just different from what I expected. I wonder if sarah and Christen have gone to bed yet. I never know how late they stay up because I'm always. oh my phone is ringing! But I can't pick it up because I have to keep typing. Oh well. They can wait. I bet it's PROPNAME. I still haven't met him. But PROPNAME said he wasn't even that cute. He is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. I need to call PROPNAME and make sure we can all go out on Friday night. My shoulder is sore. I wish I was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. That would be so nice. I can't believe I ate those ORGNAME's Treats cookies. I hate that. It takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. But then I just come home and waste all of the calories I burned off on cookies. I wonder why I get those cravings for sweets. I keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. I'm running around the track in such pain. I really hate to run. Well, I guess I don't hate it. It does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. But while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! It takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. I wonder who is actually going to read this? I hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. I don't know if that even makes sense. PROPNAME, my friend at ORGNAME wrote that today in her email. I have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. I feel that way mostly because I lack the. see I can't even think of the words. I lack the ability to think of the words. The bottom line is I need to work on my vocab because I just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike PROPNAME. However, I did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while I was getting my school supplies. I realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. But then ironically when I finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, I couldn't find them in my dictionary! I never look words up because I just lacked the motivation and then when I finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! It just goes to show that I can try but I'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. Maybe I need to read more. I need to read the newspaper everyday. I hated hearing that I had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. My neck still hurts. I need a massage. I would love to just get massages all the time. That would be so nice. I only have two minutes left. It feels like I haven't been typing for very long. I think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. I still can't type very fast. almost done. 00 seconds. wow this is a long 00 seconds. 
__label__label0 Today was a very hard day at school. After my first class, M000D, I read my Economics book for what seemed like forever. My friend PROPNAME can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. He is one of those, Everything has to my my way" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in "Spanglish" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. PROPNAME is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with PROPNAME PROPNAME's. The timer says 0 minutes 00 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do. Put up our sheep, clean the pool. My mom is going to kill me if I do not get those done. I guess I can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 00 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on LOCNAME. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 0 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $0 off a bag that I could get at ORGNAME for about $0. I did not get one. but if I had a quarter on me at the time I would have. I need to turn on my light as I can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. It is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. I needs to rain. They say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. Those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to "predict" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. But a weatherman does seem like a cool job. You can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying "Well we try to predict the weather the best we can but PROPNAME PROPNAME does what she wants sometimes. "  Alright, I only have 0 minutes left to write. My the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. My computer is getting old and I need a replacement. I have pop-ups bad. Somehow, somewhere, I got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. In doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. Basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. User-initiated contact goes through unmolested. So by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. I only have 0 minutes left to write now. That is good. Man, this is a sweet part of The Rock. This is the scene in which PROPNAME PROPNAME is in a yellow ORGNAME and is chasing PROPNAME PROPNAME, who is in a black Hummer. This scene has a lot of good action. I like action movies. I guess as I guy I find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. My belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. Without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. I still need to get my Economics book. I got the main one but the second one is still at the Co-Op. My luck they will run out of it by the time I remember to go by and pick it up. My dog needs to stop scratching. And my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. I would find that annoying. Man I could really use that drink now. Good thing I have less than a minute left to type. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME. "WooHoo!"  This has been fun. I actually wish I could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. Hope this is a good paper. Oh, it says if I want I can still keep on typing. In that case I think I will. Where did my remote go?. HAHA. got ya. you thought I was going to type more didn't ya?  Well ok I am done now. I can finally un-mute my TV and go get that ORGNAME. 
__label__label1 Well, I am wondering if I had read the instructions as carefully as I could have. The timer at the stop was unexpected. Convenient though. Although, I had planned to just look at my roommateORGNAME clock radio. It is reading 00:00. I am working on my day planner trying to figure out where my free time is going. College is different from what I expected it to be. I'm not sure what is worse knowing no one or knowing 0 people out of 00,000 undergraduates and wondering if I will see someone I know today. It could be worse. I need to try to call my aunt today. I tried yesterday, but she was not there and I really didn't want to leave a message. I really don't know my family in LOCNAME as well as I should. I wish I could go up to LOCNAME and see how cousins are doing up there. I have no idea where my roommate is. This is the 0 day he has not returned from wherever he goes. It is funny when I think about it. I wake up try not to make any noise then I realize I am the only one in the room. It is exciting as it is lonely. Maybe I'll do laundry today or something. I can't believe I actually like going to my classes. Perhaps it is because I do not have anywhere else to go. Human contact is everywhere, but I just want to feel welcomed outside of a classroom atmosphere. ORGNAME ORGNAME's ORGNAME just finished playing on the radio. The Oh Baby song just came on. I am amazed at what passes for music sometimes. Hip hop is not music. Rap is a joke. They don't even make sense, they just try to rhyme their words with the next line. I liked PROPNAME PROPNAME as a rapper, but I don't think he does it anymore. Clean rap is a thing of the past. Once it stood for something now it has shifted to image and jewelry. Sad. I am feeling a little tired. I have been sleeping very well, but sometimes I forget where I am. A moment of panic surrounds me then I realize where I am. 0 walls, 0 plain walls can be intimidating to wake up to everyday. I can't wait until we get those message boards up. Maybe we can add some character to this room. I am getting thirsty know. This dormitory is secluded, but it is alright unless I need to get something to eat or drink. I am not going to use all my Bevo Bucks on vending machines. From what I heard, they go fast while dine in dollars linger on and on. At least I am not in Jester. Almost done. Now what should I write about? 
__label__label1 man I wish that I didn't lose to my friends in foosball, when will I get to see my parents again, I really miss my dog. I would like to take some pills to get bigger but I don't know which ones I want to take my legs are so soar I can't wait to play football tomorrow but why does my hair always get in my eyes I feel really stressed out right now I really want to do good but it is hard to do the green grass looks so nice at my house n riviera I never was good at hitting the golf ball but cameron was a cool guy pistol is such a good dog my calculus homework sucks really bad I'm tired of doing it man I just spit on my computer when I coughed compaq computers are not even good man but my grandma is such a sweet lady I wish my papa was still here she misses him a lot and my uncle doesn't even care much about her or at least he doesn't pay much attention daniel was on a horrible team in basketball yes the astros are two games up in the central to bad the cowboys lost quincy carter will never amount to anything the people what was I just thin philosophy is a cool class man I don't want to do my calculus homework he gave me the wrong answer texas is going to kill memphis I mean arkansas that was a really good catch by joe jerivisus warren sapp's was better though gosh I need it get a car what was her name man she is hot but I don't think that she really likes me I'm tired but I don't want to go to bed but I need to oh well I will just sit around and think all night about stupid stuff I want to get bigger but I don't want to work out I should have went to gnc today but I wanted to eat at least I changed the oil in my car man I can't get the headlight fixed I need to call my dad I miss my room I wish that I could go home and see my family but I don't want to mmmmmmm what was I thinking about shit I can't remember I like my brothers house man I wish luke would go out more basketball is almost here the court looks sweet there are a lot of fans that go now I wished that tj was still here when is the kobe trial going to start I know he is guilty stupid oj I can't believe that the tv fell on bruce's head I like that english class the playground was fun stupid christian there was always broken glass and the tree the pond was cool I swear that there was I snake there but allen left an I could not really tell I can't believe that I told my parents that I snake chased or the time I fell into the ditch and luke left me I should have never given up me and benny could have hammered them we went and ate pizza what is that game called mmmmm damn I can't remember the watermelon and the forts haha benny the power saw man or whatever PROPNAME's was a cool place stupid allen and phillip almost broke it down man they     
__label__label1 Well I just got don't talking to my brother. He is doing well. That is good becasue I worry about him, and I don't even worry about him that much until I hear him say that he eats lunch and dinner alone. He is only a freshmen at ORGNAME and it's only been like a week and he has to have time to make friends but he is just not as good as I am at making friends. My mom worries about him too, so that makes me worry even more. It is cold in here. I wish it was warmer, but I have one roommate who likes it hot and one who likes it cold and the one who likes it cold is in the living room and I can't exactly argue since she pays rent here too. oh well. She is watching CSI, which is not something I terribly care for, its an ok show but I have different things that I watch. Her and I tried to go to the gym earlier to play racquetball bt all the courts were full, so we reserved one for tomorrow, but who knows what is going on tomorrow. We rode our bikes there and it is so hot outside, I cannot wait until it gets cold, although I will complain then too but at least the cold is more easy to deal with then the heat at least to me. god the TV is loud, I don't know why its so loud, its just me and her in the room. I have a lot to do and I am putting it off. I have math homework due next wednesday and I need to get it don't before this weekend because my boyfriend is going back home to houston and he is my help for that class. I understand just about nothing in that class and it scares me. He is very patient with me and I love him and are very grateful to him that he takes time out of his homework to help me with mine. right now his roommates are mad at him because all he does now is hang out with me and they don't understand why, well they understand but hey don't like it and I cannot help it, its his choice. I am worried about chemistry, I understand nothing in that class either. I thought I was good at chemistry, I wanted to be a pharmacist but now I just don't know and that scares me too. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed with everything right now. LOCNAME is a lot different from ORGNAME. my neck hurts and I don't know why, I didn't get to work out today, since the racquetball courts are full. my roommate just asked me if she could use my garlic. I don't really mind but she always throws a fit when I ask to borrow her stuff, not like its a big deal or anything it just gets on my nerves every now and then. I am so scared about chemistry, I have to ask my boyfriends roommate this weekend to help me figure it out. we have a quiz on tuesday over the stuff we have been learning although I feel like I have not been learning anything. it worries me so much, I feel like I have no direction again. I don't know what I want to be or what I want my major to be and my parents kept asking me and my advisor told me to just choose so I chose pharmacy and now with the chemistry part being so hard and I thought I was going to be good at it, I am scared that I won't be able to be a pharmacist anymore and that will only disappoint me and my parents. I feel like I have no direction and I can't just force myself to have one. I wish that I had something I was REALLY good at but I don't. I have a lot of things that I am good at but not one thing that I really excel in and sometimes that hurts my feelings and makes me feel bad about who I am. wow already been 00 minutes time goes by fast when you just keep typing. I need to shave my legs, now it smells gross in here because of the amount of garlic my roommate used. my arms are starting to hurt because of all the typing only 0 minutes to go. this writing thing is not that bad I think its a good idea I hope thy don't mind all my grammatical errors and or misspellings, why does my neck hurt!  I need to repaint my toenail, I keep messing them up because I won't let them dry all the way before I put my shoes back on. I wish my boyfriend would hurry up and come home at work no actually I am glad that he is working , he needs the money. our three year anniversary is coming up and I have nothing to get him, no idea whatsoever and neither of us have the money to do anything really special so I don't know exactly how this is going to work this year. man I wish I could get motivated to learn that chemistry stuff but I already feel so behind that it makes me discouraged to even try now. I know I will try but I just don't know I just wish that I knew what was going on in there. I was so good at it in high school and that was back in 00th grade and I remember some stuff that he has talked about but not hardly most of it and now I feel behind like I am not going to be able to catch up. I wish that it was not in such a big room I think that is part of my problem, I am not getting the basic review that I need to refresh my memory form so long ago but I guess that is partly my fault, I should be reading, and I am going to as soon as I can motivate myself and tell myself that I can do it and that I am good at it and that I do have a future being good at something. 
__label__label0 Stream of consciousness, I can't even spell it right, in any case I'm sitting here its 00:00 in the morning and I do not feel like doing all this crap today. too many classes when I'd rather just sit here doing nothing whatever its stupid anyway I feel like sleeping or some nonsense. nose itched. anyway I wonder what I'm going to do tonight about all that homework good god its exhausting I should taken less hours or at least not calculus that class it kicking me in the butt, I don't know anything. tangents. velocity. who freaking cares I'm no physicist, but for some reason to be an economist I need to know how to calculate velocity of a ball and decide what dosage to give patients based on tangent and secant line. honestly I don't care  I just want to get out there and keep going. chris is probably at school right now, I wonder what he is doing. oh he is in government, he better be bringing that C up to a B right now on that test. if he just tried he could be so much smarter but I distracted him and made him get the c to begin with, but its still his fault. damn nose. whatever. I just want him to do well on this one. I like it when he is smart but I don't always because I begin to feel inferior. in any case, I love him no matter how he is I just wish he had help himself more. he is working tonight, so we can do something this weekend, I paid like 00 bucks last weekend because he had no money,  its not like I'm rich. I work for my money I took out loans. my dad has not had a job since he got out in 0 months. I'm not rich. he starts his job on october 0 so that is really good because my family will be a lot better off. its quite exciting for us since we've had such little money for a while now. I'm not going to get stuck up because of it either. I wish someone would send me some mail  I check that stupid box everyday and I don't get anything why can't someone just send something to be nice  beth got a box and I still have not gotten anything. just a fucking postcard or something would be nice. oh well. ill mail someone something first then they'll have to write back, or not. I like my penguin picture, he is waving but he looks sad. I'm sorry penguin. thirsty. yuck. that cherry coke is disgusting, it tastes like carbonated water. gross and I paid 00 cents for that shit. what is up with my face itching while I?m writing this stuff. ooo. I'd rather be playing my game right now, although I really should be working out ill never be ready for thr PFT like this. can't do all those pushups and I don't know how fast I run. ill run till I vomit I guess. nose ITCHES AGAIN. I love chris he is such a nice boyfriend. not like those other guys who didn't really treat me right. chris is not perfect but he has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship and madison and all the shit that caused. in any case, we are happy now and madison can kiss my ass. he asked me to marry him in a sense that we aren't engaged but we will marry each other, we're moving in pretty soon together,  I wish he had stop being such a mama's boy and tell her to get over it. I'll probably be the one that convinces her to pay for it and be happy about it. saves a lot of money and chris and I can be together. we fight and stuff but its never big stuff. my parents will be fine with it. my dad will take a while to get used to it but my mom will support me if I really want it. it saves like 000 a month by doing it this way. MY NOSE!. 00 minutes. u got to be kidding me   this should be over by now. he should make it 00 minutes for next semester's class. actually 00. I want them to work more than I did. lalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalallllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. your my best friend. oooooooooo  youre more than a lover there could never be another to make me feel the way you do. oooooooooo  we just get closer fall in love all over. what a good song love that tim mcgraw his wife is cute too such a cute couple. jamie just got online. that girl does not know how to have fun whatever. choochoochoo. my brain feels pretty blank.

__label__label0 Well, I'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that I know I have to do this. Just got back from school and had lunch. My whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. I cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. I've left the TV on. I always like to watch something as I eat. Something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. It's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. I've always wondered about the concept of time. How it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. I have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. I'm not getting old so much as I had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. Headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. I was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to PROPNAME PROPNAME to do some shopping. My boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. What a nasty shock!. At least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. I left the TV on way too loud. Funny how I sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others I love background noises. Leave the TV on just for "company". Talk about true desperation. CSI is on. Love the show. Absolutely fascinating. I am such a TV addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. Got an exam coming up on Monday, got to start studying for that. Hope it's not too tough. Gosh, I really miss home and family. It's tough being away in a foreign land. I can't wait to get back to LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I am so looking forward to my trip in LOCNAME at the end of the year. I am so excited about LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. It was hot out today. I'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. The ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. I'm glad I missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. Like winter so much better. I'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in LOCNAME. Have to admit that I don't really know what else to talk about. I just know that I want to shower after this but knowing me, I'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the CSI marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so I can continue the moving process. My new apartment needs a lot of TLC before it will be in tip top shape. Then again, only about three more months till I leave the states and am back on the road to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME then LOCNAME. This year has been a most trying one. But I know that I am a stronger and wiser person for it. I've been through so much in life, but I know there's so much more. I'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in ORGNAME before I leave and a family friend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. My body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. Maybe I won't need/want that fan after all. There's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. I am almost there, just 0 more minutes left. I really need to focus my time and attention on what I'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. I'm actually speaking as I type. Is that normal? Or more precisely, that's normal for me. I wonder what Professor PROPNAME would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. Ok. back to CSI. 
__label__label0 So yesterday my boyfriend from ORGNAME came down to LOCNAME to celebrate our 0 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 00 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 0,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from LOCNAME, which was so pretty, and LOCNAME isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it. But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone. I don't even use any other phone. I am always on it. I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells. I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do. Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely. I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type. But then my mind goes blank for a second. I never really thought I was a good writer. In fact, I thought I was horrible. My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class. It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class. I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well. It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else. My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester. I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate. I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature. 
__label__label1 Today has been a terrible day here in LOCNAME LOCNAME, because it is all ugly and humid outside. I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family. My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me. He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in LOCNAME and that I can't come down for the homecoming football game. I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud. I need time to think and be alone. My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework. It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren't towards me. Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing. I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand. This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and "party music",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music. I don't mind that music either, but I prefer my country. Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn't listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something's, I have this hyper personality, and I have an "Irish persons'" chin. I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face. I have a bad habit of smelling things. I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer. I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something's. I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized. It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn't care if I got dirty, or if I didn't take a bath; I hated taking baths. I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn't feel like it has been 00 minutes, it seems a lot faster. I thought that LOCNAME was going to be a SUPER SCARY school, but it isn't because I have awesome classes and the environment here is awesome, everyone here is friendly. I  
__label__label0 Okay, I am writing this thing called stream ORGNAME consciousness writing. I find it hard to type right now. I don't know if I should follow proper grammar. My PROPNAME firewall just detected another blocked intrusion. I don't like this. Annoying hackers. Why don't they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me. I have 0 roommates and they are all good except for one. He is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners. He watches TV loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep. He even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it. That is so annoying and I can't stand it right now. My goodness, it has only been 0 mins? I've been writing a lot of things already. My arms are hurting because I can't type for so long and I hate typing. I'm not a typer, my brother and cousin are flawless typers but I am not. I already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me. I want to destroy this key board. I want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy. This is really annoying me. I want to take the psych research right now but I can't because I am not 00 yet. That is a load of bullshit if u ask me. can't it be 00? What is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months?? A few months of extra knowledge??? I don't think so. I hate my birthday, there is also a math midterm on my birthday, hooray for me. how nice, what a nice birthday gift. I have a tendency to measure how much I type. I always limit myself and not going to much bec. I always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and I am very lazy so I will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved. Like this writing assignment right now, if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal, I will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 00 minutes of my time doing nothing but write, senseless writing. And I ate writing, I hate the damn typo errors, I hate now typing fluidly like others, I hate making mistakes, I hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers! I hate this activity. I am not in a very good mood right now, I kind of understand that, I wonder why? Is it my roommate? maybe, is it this senseless activity? maybe. maybe its because ORGNAME of ORGNAME has cut my freaking internet, no I can't download beyond 0 gigs. nooo bec. u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others. What do I say? I say to hell with the others, what do they care if they don't really use the internet in the first place. They are just wasting bandwidth on nothing. This is just pathetic. You guys are afraid of the recording companies, the ORGNAME or something like that. That's what you are. Afraid. Why don't you just leave us alone like other schools? They have FREE internet, not this cheap limited "u have to pay" for internet. I am just ranting away all my frustrations on this thing aren't I? I hope no one reads it, if u do. the hell do I care! Damn it. College life sucks. To much reading. Everyone expects you to read all the chapters and expect you to understand the next day during the lecture. Well, tough luck, we are not that smart. Some people do well in lectures and some do well with books. Some people just can understand with the book so why do u pick on us?? Everything you test should be on your lectures. The book is just for bringing your knowledge of the subject to a more concrete manner. Lectures are what really is important, and you just read the book to review. You don't test what u do not teach in lectures!! Thank God I only have a few more minutes left. My fingers are burning now. I cannot be stuck doing the same thing for prolonged periods of time. It is just not right. It is so boring. Funny though. if u come to think of it. Ironic. I cannot stand doing a same thing for so long but I can stand doing nothing for so long. What kind of person am I? Indolent. Lazy. Pathetic. That's what I am. A person who does not want to leave his little protective sphere. a controlled sphere. I am afraid to do things with risks, I will never succeed in life like that. Doomed not to be a leader. 
__label__label1 our world is pretty fucked up. I've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with. well not the only thing, but almost the only thing. the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves. between hurricane PROPNAME and soon to be hurricane PROPNAME, why do we need Chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse. why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right. be it a Christian, a Muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong. so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too?  "they're religious. they're unstable. they're on medication. they've had a hard life. man fuck that. people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong. I don't understand this blur of morals and truth. how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong?  I suppose I'll get off my soap box now, I just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet I know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today. the only thing I can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example. so I was just reading PROPNAME has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president. ha. that makes me laugh, I say more power to bush, he says he's clean, I believe him, I don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john PROPNAME. I don't even want to vote, but I feel its my duty. so who am I going to vote for?  its like picking the lesser of two evils?  and which one is lesser of a SOB than the other one?  man I don't know. I suppose I'll vote for bush, being that this is LOCNAME. but I don't know if I'd feel right about that. maybe I'll just write in a vote. I mean I know all of LOCNAME electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter?  maybe I'll run for president one day?  naw, I doubt it, I'm not moderate enough. not that I'm a radical, just that I don't think I could say things to appease one person or another. I have my beliefs and damn it, I'm sticking to 'them. that doesn't mean I'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but I'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business. this feels good by the way. I'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying. I kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since I'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me. so I'll just let them be. my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently. they're a couple years older than me, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her. she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together. I can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it. anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, I can tell things are getting intense. I didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically I was here first so I suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal. she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do. man, I feel sorry for them both. he just wants to love her, be there for her. and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is. love is a funny thing. love is a fucked up thing too. I've only been in love once. and I've fallen out of love once. its a painful process. but then again, I wouldn't replace it. it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that I can completely support. so why is it that humans love?  or choose to love?  or choose not to love?  I'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling. to be able to call someone and just talk to them. see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things. I wonder what my wife will be like?  I wonder when I'll meet her. my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married I think. I may be wrong, but I doubt it. I think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul. that's kind of scary. hey, my brother is going to be married forever. I'm going to have a sister in law. maybe I'll be an aunt or uncle soon. now that is really weird. its crazy how time moves. I feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time I feel like I still think and act like a 0th grader. oh 0th grade, those were good days. I thought I was the coolest kid in the world. and at the time, I may have been right. I was one cool 0th grader. it rained today. I love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure. it makes me appreciate the day that much more. I've spent a total of almost 0 hours at this coffee shop today. reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things I can support 000% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least. I ate at freebirds today too, that was so good. I'd say the feeling I have after I eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings I'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world. because when I've finished freebirds, I don't even desire love, because I am so full and content I don't need anything else. its a good feeling. I'm thinking about what I'm thinking about writing. if that makes sense. it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and I'm working on that, but I think that I'm thinking too much about it. I've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now I'm thinking too hard about writing something. its ok though, because I only have like 00 seconds left. maybe I'll eat cookies later tonight, I bet those will good 
__label__label1 Being a twin I always wonder if my brother thinks like I do. I don't mean like does he have the same thought I mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me. My mind like to wander and I imagine many different scenarios in my head. Like where I will be in 00 years how long I will live and why people act the way they do. Everyday I think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest. Then you have people who succeed no matter what and I wonder why them. Then there are people who seem to go no where in life. I am not seriously making this up for the past year or so I have been trying to figure out the world. I guess since I have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home. I also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career. I felt at one time I was determined to be an astronaut, but now I am leaning towards the media business. I would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life. Although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad  and good experience. I am talking about me coming to college. If this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how I think I continuously switching ideas in my mind. It is a wonder of why I have some of the thoughts I have, but we wont go into that. Being my first to take Psychology I wonder what the class is going to offer me, how it will help me to explore the human mind. I have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed I stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends. Since being here I have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes, but I often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable. This summer I worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how I should view the world. There would be weeks when I got up at before 0:00 am everyday I kind of got this feeling like is this what I will be doing for the rest of my life. I thought to myself therefore I will do good in college to help better the career. Working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars I wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and I guess they do somehow. That is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when I believe there is an overall problem in certain area. But are we certain at all what goes on. 
__label__label0 Well, I have to confess, this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do. I am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as I go. I hear TV in the next room. My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention. I really should be watching it you because you see I'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now). However, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention. There now talking about PROPNAME not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I can't hear. Wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I'm thinking. It's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain  is thinking. Ah, pancakes are ready. I would like to go eat them now but I'm stuck here for another 0 minutes and 00 seconds. OOppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder. No pancakes I guess. I went to the Phantom of the Opera last semester. It was a LOCNAME production and vg. I have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why I bring it up. I was depressing though, for all  the talent and wonderful set changes. Do you like  the sound of the AC. I  do. I don't know why but it comforts me. I think the reason it does is because when I was younger the AC would come and there was a vent right over my bed  so to keep warm I would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and I like to snuggle. That was a run on sentence but that's how I think, in run ons, so I'm just trying to be accurate. I had to look up how to spell sentence. Yes, I know that's horrible, but you see I'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very  hard for  me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels. Like in the word sentence, I'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence. Another example is that I used to spell "they" "they" because the e sounded like a long a to me. I better fix that if I'm going into government.  
__label__label0      Man today was a really long day. I'm a so tired but I have all this crap to do still. mostly calculus. I don't know why I took 000D. its so freaking hard. I hope I'll do okay because I just have to. I signed up for tutoring but I don't know how much that'll help. I like this cd I'm listening to. I've listened to it a million times but still like it. man I'm really upset that alias isn't coming on this season. I love that show. It was one thing I was looking forward to this semester. I wish I could be like LOCNAME and kick butt. but instead I'm really boring. man I am so freaking tired. the bathroom has gotten really disgusting. I don't want to be the only one to clean it but I don't want to be the only one to complain that its dirty. I hate cleaning toilets. I mean it would be okay if it were at home because that's like our toilet and I kind of know the germs around. but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek I just can't think about it with out cringing. college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to. I guess I'll get used to it. Its going okay so far. I mean its fun and all but I don't know. I really really miss home. Its weird not coming home to your family everyday. I've met some really cool people but I still miss my old friends. but I'm getting used to going places by myself. Woo hoo I'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom. sheehs its only been 0 minutes. I don't know how much more I can type. This is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha I am typing what I am thinking so hey. my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping. Wait I missed my favorite song on the cd. Oh well. I wish asthma were here with me. We could do some awesome stuff together. but amrita seems really cool we've had great convos. but I'm still scared to make new close friends like I loved my friends from hs. We were such GOOD friends. Making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over. Its hard for me I'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere. I feel really  alone sometimes in a room full of people but I guess that's natural. wow its only been 0 min and 00 seconds. but I shouldn't complain  this is better than doing limits in calculus. lord calculus. I'm so worried I have to do good I have to. After this I should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk. tomorrow is discussion so it shouldn't be so bad. but I'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which isn't good when I'm totally clueless. Its embarrassing. but I guess I'm not the only one. Some people didn't know the answers either. The only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if I knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. He's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though I can be boring haha. I think he feels bad for me because I'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . So many friends and places to go. I should keep my self busy so I won't get so lonely. I'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. I want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. I have second thoughts about everything I have no idea why. I wonder where my roommate went. She works out everyday. Its inspiring I should too. I'll go to the gym. Haha I'll try who knows if I actually will. I went once and really liked it but I just have to find time. It seems like I have boatloads of work. but college is good. I'll get through it. I just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. Who knows I still have at least 0 years . I'm so sleepy. 0 more minutes of this and then calculus. No time to sleep. Ooh I need to watch ORGNAME tonight. I missed last night but PROPNAME PROPNAME was there. It might of been interesting even though I'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but I think there's some validity to it. sigh. I'm going home this weekend. I'm excited. I'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. Haha that's what's cool about being Indian. parents can always find some other Indian kid to drive you home. oh well. I'm so tired there's only 0 minutes to go. This was actually cool and stress relieving. you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out. oooh asthma just imed me. I haven't talked to her in a while. damn she hangs out with matt PROPNAME now. I find that to be so freaking funny. who would of thought? anyways man all I can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha I like dreaming lately I have weird dreams last time I had this nightmare 
__label__label0      This is kind of new and interesting. I have never done my homework like this before. I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment. Psychology is such an interesting field to study. It is my major in fact at this moment. I don't know if I will change though. The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder. With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything. I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer. I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together. I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. A dark haired man just sat near me. He didn't sit at the computer directly near me. I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really. People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway. For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. He wasn't very charming. That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't. He really isn't my type. He is in the business school. Ehh. I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'. Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money. People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner. I was that poor. I think it is because of this, I tend to value education. I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. That to me  
__label__label1      I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, "yeah I party", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 0 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 0th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about "friends" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch "joey" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, PROPNAME, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 00, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the "brady bunch" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 0000. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 00th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 00th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 0th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 00 or 00, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  PROPNAME. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 0  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later 
__label__label0      Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, "How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?"  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. Its the middle ORGNAME the week and the weekend is almost here. I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one. The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school. Its a real drag. I'm always so tired I hate it. Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. Maybe I'll go visit PROPNAME (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, ORGNAME ORGNAME, the drive is a drag though. The road trip that me and PROPNAME went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. All they're concerned about is putting UT down or "TU" as they call us since we're not "THE" ORGNAME of ORGNAME but "A" ORGNAME ORGNAME!  Isn't it stupid. Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. They do have a lot of school spirit. Makes me wish that I was into that stuff. Who knows, maybe when all the football games start. I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get. I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out. I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready. My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself. I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform. How amazing. That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team. I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. I love it. There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management. The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going. I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an "all out" fan of theirs. But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. Its worth the experience. 
__label__label1      Well, this is interesting. Let's see. right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really. PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more. studious than what I'm doing. But I don't mind. Let's see. my hands have been smelling kind of funny. Like rust, almost. But I haven't touched anything rusty. Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves. Other than that, I don't really smell anything. God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now. I really want to eat. I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now. But no, I have to be a "conformist" and go when all my other friends are going. Now I have to pay for my food. And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying. Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience. I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum. Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room. We had it set at level 0, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk. Man, that was weird. I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps. The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 0, and their food is fine. Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination. Anyway. what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy. Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it. No, not that kind of sleepy. It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms. Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness. Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today. I'm so proud of my productivity today. After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my ORGNAME application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework. That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes. I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron. Whoa. Sometimes I think I work too hard. I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of. Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes. Man, I need to spit out this gum. It's like I'm chewing rubber or something. And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten. I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more. Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying. They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology. Here's the funniest one: "penia" means abnormal reduction. So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha. I can't help it, I'm still immature. Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it. But you must admit, that's a good way to remember "penia", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term. Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning. Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at ORGNAME. Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today. I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend. Let's see. six more minutes. Sorry, but I am counting down. Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent. I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy. Yes, petty jealousy. Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human. But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that. Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window. Did you know that dogs sleep about 00 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury. Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury. I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm. Or perhaps they were already warm. who knows. I definitely don't. Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time. I need to go to sleep. But no, it's only six in the evening. Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here. Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. and dream. I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams. Or maybe I don't want that. Who knows what would turn up. 
__label__label0 so this is the first entry, and it happens to fall on a day when things are really. Shitty. I don't know if I have the desire to join the rowing team, though I've already told everyone that I was going to; my internet connection was messing with my earlier, a reason to cry in itself; my relationship with a boy I don't know enough about. Lets start with that. I've been dating him for about a year and a half, and I don't know who he is. will he cheat on me?  is my relationship anything to be worried about?  if a stranger looked into our lives, would he giggle, surprised at the immaturity of our  relationship?  is it anything to try to save?  I hope so, if not I'm a fool. but I think I'm one anyway. but PROPNAME PROPNAME, he knows his shit, it seems. or its that he knows that he doesn't know his shit. I wish I knew. I wish I knew him as well. though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me. I have nothing against christians or their beliefs. I wish I could give myself up to that with no regrets. But I can't. I've been down that road, and its lead nowhere. have I spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian?  will I ever be content in my own two damn shoes?  will I ever feel like I'm at home? will I be successful?  would I be happy without success?  it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect, even the less desireable, that there's some author out there, other than someones god, writing the stories of our lives. but he forgot me?  why am I not going anywhere, why can't I find this happiness and joy. my life is pathetic at this point. maybe its just this horrible attitude, but the only time I feel like I can be happy (or at least not pissed off) is with brian, laying in his bed, thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time. but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements?? it would seem that I am happy with him, but then comes the doubt and fears. I need to find myself, I say. only thing is. I don't know what that means. does anyone? its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds. A state you need to obtain, but its in fact unattainable. the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they don't know how to go about it, and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them, so they can suffer justly. I wish I were born in the old days, when you died of a flu and there wasn't such a thing as AIDS. people lived lightly, they wrote, they read, sometimes found something to revolutionize, but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life. where did that virtue go?  how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time, and where would it have gone?  I wish I could sift through the ashes of our charred world, seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere, but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it. how come I can't be a writer?  how come I can't write?  I want to study people, not medicine. why would I declare this major?  if I studied other peoples lives all the time, would I have a life of my own?  is true adulthood worth it?  people always want what they can't get. I get what I don't want. everything always seems like it gets really good, I mean reaaaally good, right when its about to end. will college be like this?  will life itself be like this?  will I stop asking so many damn questions??  will he call?  would I want him to? I don't want this life. anyone want to trade?  I want a life of the storybooks, of unquestionable love, faith and virtue. knowledge, hope, and an impeccable body would be nice too. I want all the money in the world, I want to live in a time without money. I want to be a movie critic, I hate bad actresses with hair that doesn't fit their character. I hate living with someone other than who I love. I hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about. I hate being inadequate, I hate second guessing everyone. I hate being critical. I hate chocolate chips. I hate gaining weight. I hate stretchy jeans that don't look good. I hate running out of time, I hate trying to fill time. I hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself, although I'm not sure why it would. Seven six five four three two one. 
__label__label1      I love my girlfriend leah. She is so awesome. I love her big butt and her hair, I love her tongue and her smile. Man oh man does she give good hand jobs. Almost as good as sex. ALMOST. there are some things I don't like about her though. She is a tiny bit chubby but it doesn't really bother me that much. She is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves. I also worry that she is a shopaholic. and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income. I wonder what I will be doing 0 years from now. it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj. I think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time. I believe that would be best, cause then I could stay up late still and sleep in a little later. the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too. I would have fun being the dj in the morning, but I would hate the hours. I mean whoa, not my kind of lifestyle. I also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out. I haven't been really an active gym goer. I need to start doing that. I am trying to think of what would be a good time to go. on mondays I could go right after class at 0, same thing goes for wednesdays. on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays, I should probably go right after Spanish, because then after I am done I could go eat something, that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that I wouldn't have to eat before I go to Spanish then. I could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday, Wednesday and friday. and then weight train on tuesday and Thursday. maybe I should do the opposite. cause then I could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out, plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time. now about tennis. I really hope I can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice. I should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things I need to do. it would be cool if leah and sara came to UT next year, unfortunetly I don't see that happening when it comes to leah. I wonder how long I should wait before proposing. I think waiting til at least my junior year would be best. because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship. I mean two years is a long time to be with someone, and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together. no wait they were actually 0. 0 years I think, maybe 0. 0 when he asked and 0. 0 before marriage, I don't know, whatever it is. the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money. I could probably go back to ORGNAME cause I mean they don't pay that poorly. possibly even be a CCM or something so that I could bring a little extra dough in. I would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station. I wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show. I should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if I could get some kind of spot in there. even if it wasn't a show, but a technical thing. okay so when it comes to homework what should I do so that I have somewhat of a schedule. if I sleep in the mornings, or at least plan to, I don't think I should try scheduling that in. what I should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure I get hw done first before I do anything else. because then I could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldn't be too bad. cause that's probably my problem, the fact that I don't go to sleep early enough. I want to go to midnight rodeo this Saturday, I just wish roger creager wasn't playing there. remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later. back to study. monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all I have is my writing class EASY, and Spanish, so getting out late on those days isn't too bad. Tuesdays and thursdays I should try to make sure I am done with hw by like 0, cause then I could go eat after I did my hw. that's a pretty good plan. only on occasions should I change that up. what I mean by that is like being invited to do stuff, never let it be online poker or TV that distracts me, that includes playing xbox. even if I think I have had a hard day so far, just think how more satisfying that resting will be once I have everything done, I mean knowing u don't have anything left to do is a nice feeling. this writing this is going by faster than I thought. I didn't know I had all this stuff on my mind. I think it would be nice to have a 0pac on my body, and some muscle. you know, it really does kind of upset me that leah doesn't want me hanging out with females alone. I find that it shouldn't matter. I mean on one hand I know her past, and I don't want to upset her on something as small as this, but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal. maybe I should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this. HOPEFULLY we can compromise. I am kind of tired but I really do need to study for Spanish quizzes tomorrow, and I should look over chapter 0 for this class. I wonder when the first test is, I think it is on the 00th. that's coming up pretty soon. I should look at that handbook thing I have on sample test questions on this friday. along with that I could reread philosophy and study some more Spanish, and go to a seminar for writing class. this was kind of a fun thing to do. I kind of like having a diary like this, helps me think clearly. 
__label__label1      Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team. I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow. My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online. I do not knw why I feel so tired. I think its because I am having too much homework. I really do not like the hot weather. I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather. I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework. I really miss all my family. I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters. I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old. I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, "The king of fighters. " Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't. I am hungry. I need to go to sleep. I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy. I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week. I'm tired of sittinglike this. I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting. The lyrics from the CD "Jaguares" are so amazing. It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind. If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes. I think I am. 
__label__label0      I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet. It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do. I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. I've never felt so busy in my life. Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out LOCNAME, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about. It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary. We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be. At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus. Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation. It was a great detour. Wow, 00 minutes is a long time, I just realized that. I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. So yea, back to the stressed out business. I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 0 at a community college, then I went to PROPNAME, LOCNAME to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. I worked and got paid. Good stuff. A few days after I got home from PROPNAME, I made my way to LOCNAME. My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. And I think we all know how busy things are around here. I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken. For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 00, the weekend before classes start. This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful. And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people. Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and the reception is in LOCNAME a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in LOCNAME, followed by who knows how long of being in LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME. My home is in LOCNAME, a little town of pop. 00,000 in LOCNAME LOCNAME, just two hours north of LOCNAME, 0 hours south of LOCNAME, and four hours east of LOCNAME. Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. I guess we'll see. Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.        
__label__label0      So I think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete. It gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads. I probably don't realize some of the things that I think. maybe after looking at this I will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling. I smell food. I just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more. I have this weezer song in my head. I don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head. I hope it gets out fast because it is annoying. my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it. that would hurt. never have I done so much reading as I have done this past week. it is annoying. I do not enjoy reading much. oh well. I guess I have to do it anyway. my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light. the apartment is nice. I get my own room and it is very spacious. I hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock. its bugging me and I think its a result of me typing. yep. I stopped and the ticking stopped. I think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on. how ironic maybe. interesting. it stopped. they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore. ill be right back sorry. blanked out for a second. the days seem to go by very fast. the weekends go slow however. I like the weekends. this weekend should be great because I will go hoome for the labor day holiday. seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy. greek mythology has too many  names to remember even a quarter of them. its very a nnoying. how many times have  I said annoying in my train of thought. a good nap would be nice right now. I like that painting of the melting clocks. its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good. I wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars. its just not worth it to me. I am a very economical person when handling money. sometimes its good and bad. a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though. cooking. I need to start cooking more things. sure the microwave is awesome but I need to expand my cuisine. iron chef. funny show. iron chef should fight emeril. I wonder who would win. they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on Emerils show when he says those things. it will give it an old school flavor. flavor is good. does water have a flavor. is the flavor water. who cares its good when you're thirsty. I just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade. because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff. or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars. ill look into it. my mouth is dry. I oculd actually go for some water right now. my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table. I wish I could fly. I just saw some birds flying. I wish I could do that. where would I go. I'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too. that would be awesome. today is the first day of the rest of my life. that quote always struck me as very cool sounding. is hould really start using my planner to right down what I need to get done. my memory doesn't serve me quite well. I want some of the energy arizona iced tea. I haven't had any for  quite some time. I'm due for some. but I guess right now all I got is water. that will have to do. potpourri is such a weird word. but smells nice so I guess they are even. I bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought. it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much. this is one of the best writing assignments I've ever had to write because there is no structure. I am a poor writer. I should practice and get help. I probabloy won't though. ill just get by onw what I can do. it just isn't my thing. donde esta el biblioteca. I need to work on myh Spanish to. hopefully I won't have to take a Spanish class. that would piss me off. I can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter. it would take me too much time. I think tex mex will serve me just fine. bien bien bien. if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because I'm so itno righting this. I hope that doesn't happen 
__label__label0      Why don't the washing machines ever work in my dorm? I mean I swipe and swipe my student I'd and nothing. Nothing ever starts up. I don't carry change on me just because I know Ill spend it on dumb stuff, so I guess Ill never get my clothes washed. Which is a really strange thing because back home I am so meticulous about being clean and having a something new to wear everyday. I don't really care as much here. I only care when I go out what I have on. This is for the pure reason of wanting to impress males. There is so many cute guys at LOCNAME, going out is soon going to be a problem if I don't get my all my work done. I am so scared of not doing well in my classes. This is the big times. If I screw up here there may be no point of return. Its either do it or get out. There's like 00000 people here who are pre-med and I'm guessing 0000 of them are smarter than me, which really doesn't work in my favor when it comes to getting into med school. Ah, why am I putting myself down!? I can do it. I know I can, I've wanted this forever so I'm not going to just give up. I really loathe calculus though. I work so hard,and then I always seem to screw up the exams. Why? I don't know, maybe I have testing anxiety? Is that really a real thing or is just some excuse I'm making up for my bad testing skills. Well, whatever it is I need to get it under control. My roommate seems to have everything under control. She wakes up, makes her bed, goes to class, does 0 work out classes, eats fruits and vegetables for dinner, studies, then goes to sleep at 00 pm. I'm like "WOW" here's the model student, so of course what do I do? I try to model her actions. Yah, its not working so well. I am just not such a structured person. I do believe I have A. D. D though, or maybe once again this is just another excuse. I just cannot focus on my reading assignments for more than like thirty minutes. What's the deal? I have no idea. Oh I have so much to do tomorrow, so many things to take care of . I need to find out when my old professors office hours are this fall. I really don't want to have to see him again, but its got to be done. Especially if I want my grade fixed. I hated my grades this summer. I can't believe I let myself slip that low. Well its really taught me a lesson. I think. I mean I am actually getting more studying done, or activities persay, such as this writing assignment. But I still feel like the same old me. Gosh, there this amazing jacket I want at the mall. I wish I just had an endless supply in my checking account. But don't we all? Yah good thing I got a new job here. My job is so badass. Wait am I allowed to say ass in a school assignment. hmmmm interesting. Oh well there's no going back now! But I do get paid a lot of money and that helps me a lot, because I am so expensive. If I walk into a store, the only thing I'm going to like I can guarantee is going to the be the most money. My room is so freezing cold. I really need to find out if something can be done about this. It's 00 degrees all the time, I'm sitting here in like my eskimo clothes in the middle of summer in texas. It's ridiculous. I really miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. They had their own thermostats in each room. It was clean. And big. Speaking of san jac. Football season starts Saturday. WOOHOO. I'm the biggest dork, I get so into school events like that. It just feelsreally cool to be a part of something so big. It is sort of like when I'm walking past the tower and the mail bldg. and I look down and see the capitol building. I'm amazing, like "wow, I really made it here!" It's kind of surreal to me, like an out of body experience. Then there is always the kids who make it look so easy to be here and like they don't give a damn, I'm like stop that! Exclamation marks make it look like I'm overly excited or yelling or something. I don't like that so I won't use them any more. Is this 00 min up yet? okay, I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking that. Great now I've fallen into the trap of thinking about thinking of what to write for this paper. I thought all day long about how to avoid this hole. Yah it wasn't doable. Is doable a word? do able. I don't know but I like using it. uhhhh. That's the sound of me going braindead. Well not necessarily, that would mean I was dead and obviously I'm not because duh here I am typing. I just really can't concentrate with my room being so cold. My nose is like an icicle. You know speaking of stream of consciousness, I have always wanted to read PROPNAME. Isn't that the name of the book by PROPNAME PROPNAME ? Yah I read an excerpt from it and it was very intriguing. They do this whole writing thing a lot better than I do. I'm looking at my writing and I feel that I sound Childish, not intelligent, like I should be dictating more mature words. Oh god there I go trying to sound smarter. I guess all I can do is write what's in my head. This is me, this is it. Only like one more minute to go and thank goodness. I feel like I've been having to force myself to think or something for the last twenty. Plus I've been thinking in like turbo speed. Sometimes I talk like that. Very fast. People can't understand me its horrible. Oh damn my hand hurts so bad. Ok good I am finally. D-o-n-ne. 
__label__label1      Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about "me". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. LOCNAME LOCNAME. LOCNAME LOCNAME. The  LOCNAME LOCNAME of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with "make love" or "marry" or "help through important  issues". Certainly not "castrate. "  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. "  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when PROPNAME and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates PROPNAME PROPNAME. LOCNAME is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW PROPNAME. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call PROPNAME a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as "nigger" or "spic" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it. Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical "good people" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around LOCNAME for some god or cause might hope. That's what makes music --- done. Thanks  for the toilet! 
__label__label1 Today was a long day. I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep. Chemistry 000, I have found, is really kicking my butt. I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better. Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 0 with PROPNAME and the guys. I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework. One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology. This weekend I'm taking PROPNAME to LOCNAME to go see PROPNAME and PROPNAME for PROPNAME's birthday party. LOCNAME LOCNAME is such a far drive from here. I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to PROPNAME for the actual party. I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal. I haven't had one of those for so long. Well, actually PROPNAME's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to LOCNAME, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking. After the ORGNAME vs. UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to LOCNAME spur of the moment. PROPNAME's parents have a house in LOCNAME. His dad works for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME as an athletic director. Hmmm. I am running out of things to talk about now. October 0th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend PROPNAME has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone. I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would. High school was great but college is so much better. Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult. I think I'll probably change my major a few times too. I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there. And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just PROPNAME wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 0 at Jester tonight at 0. I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible. I had a TIP mentor meeting at 0, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking. Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking. That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week. Critical thinking is thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 00/00 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to LOCNAME to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in LOCNAME until 0 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 00 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. . The End! 
__label__label1      I'm sitting in my dorm room and it's very cold. I don't think we control the temperature in our room because sometimes it's hot and sometimes it's cold no matter what temperature setting we put it on. I'm borrowing my roommate's computer because I don't have one yet. My dad is going to bring it up hopefully this weekend when my parents come for my brothers soccer tournament. I also want him to get me a new cell phone because my phone book is full on mine and I can't put any new numbers in it which is difficult considering we're in college and I'm meeting quite a few new people. Many of the people I met because I went through rush and also I've met a lot of people on my dorm hall. I'm living in srd. The food is pretty good but I'm really picky. PROPNAME was eating mushroom soup today and I think soup and mushrooms are gross she said I was missing out on so many great things because I was so picky but I don't like to try foods I've already got preconceived notions about as being not good. I like pizza. I really miss eating dominoes pizza on friday nights. I was thinking about the zebra thing we talked about in class and I was wondering that: if zebras are always releasing cortozol (not sure on spelling) and their immune systems are always being shut down in response, then why are zebras never sick? wouldn't they be sick like all the time? or are they sick and we just don't know it?? maybe you would have to do some serious research on zebras to find this out at least that's what me and claire concluded. I'm glad that claire is here with me at LOCNAME even though we weren't like really really close friends in highschool I've known her since kindergarten which is pretty remarkable to know someone for that long. from kindergarten to college I mean. I've been calling a lot of my high school friends. mainly when I'm bored like when I was waiting for the bus the other day for like thirty minutes seriously it took so long. And the guy behind me had a pizza and it smelled so good. I go visit jeff a lot (my bf) because I think about him a lot and I wish I could see him at least every day but that might not be possible considering I have a lot of home work I have to do and all the other stuff I'm going to be responsible for once school and equestrian team gets going and it's sucks because he doesn't have a car so he can't just drop by even though I drop by his place like all the time I did at home too . I'm always trying to surprise him or make him happy and it just sucks that guys don't get girls. They're dating impaired almost all of them suffer from this ailment I would say. I mean some things seem so obvious for him to do to just make me so happy. Little things I mean and he doesn't even see them but as long as I'm complaining about jeff at least I'm not going out with andy. I can't see how bret (my roommate who I know from highschool) can go out with him. He's such a close minded person. A lot of the time just a jerk. And everyone who meets him get's that first impression from him too. And I just think bret is way too good for him but for some reason she loves him and I know he loves her and he's not a bad guy but the other day talking about wanting to live with a gay guy like will and grace or be friends with a gay person he was like "well then you'd just be condoning that life style" omg what a freakin aggie seriously, he's such a hick I can't believe he would be so close minded but he is and his ego is so huge and bret is pissed off at him all the time and the long distance relationship thing just isn't go to work so iwish she'd just dump him because I think he's a jerk. If he wasn't her bf I probably wouldn't even be friends with him. Yikes any way I can really get carried away on that issue . I miss going out to the barn everymorning. I'm afraid I'm going to gain weight because I don't have the motivation to jjust exercise and I don't dance everyday like I used to and I just ate two cups of ice cream and even though it's fat free bret says it still has like a jillion calories and I don't even really know what that means/entails but it sounds like something that will make me gain weight. And I guess I'm just really concerned with that. I also don't know about this whole sorority thing I'm a ORGNAME and the girls are great but sometimes I just wish that I had gotten a bid fro chi o because I spent like hours killing myself over that decision and I got DG in the end anyway. And sometimes they baby you and you're like uh I think I can handle life here thank you very much but oh well at least you have people watching out for you whether it's a little annoying or not and it does make me feel precious. PROPNAME stopped by last night just to tuck us in and that made me feel special. Sometimes I go crazy learning about psycology because sometimes I think it's just ridiculous to study why we do things and you know like "if you sit on this side of the room will you be more likely to eat spinach" or something because I just wonder why we study it instead of just leaving it alone and living it. it just seems like a scientist was really bored one day and unknowingly decide to start a study of something absolutely crazy. I don't even know what I'm saying but sometimes I don't care or want to know why we do what we do. We just do it! and that's it why should we stress ourselves out trying to solve the mystery of everything why not just live it. Man I drive myself crazy sometimes. I'm going to eat a red hot fire ball now. Actually they're called atomic fireballs. I noticed that last night. Me and jeff are going stargazing on the RLM tonight. I hope it works out because I don't know too much about it. Ok did it not even bother bret when andy made that incredibly ignorant comment about being gay? because he says jerky stuff all the time and somehow she just sees past it to how wonderful he is. 
__label__label1      Ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again. The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. I hope I don't misspell too many things. I am sniffingly so loud. I should go get a tissue. I never did learn how to type right on this thing. Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird. Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. I really wish I could concentrate for more than 0 seconds when I'm emotional. It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight. But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school. I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life. They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. Wow, LOCNAME tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails. I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. I think it's time to switch positions. Ah. Much better. Now my typing skills really stink. It's really hard to lay on the ground and type. Oh I have a laptop. That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC. I still can't get comfortable. The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. That's better. I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place. AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. Stupid back gives me problems all the time. I miss Dr. PROPNAME!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt. It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing. That might not make me look too smart. Oh, well. I don't want to go back and look at it. It would just take to long. God, my nose is still stopped up. My skin is drying out to. I need to wash my face and moisturize. I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  I had to retypr it like three times. You know for someone who is supposed to be smart, I am pretty dumb sometimes. I wonder if PROPNAME thought I was dumb in class today. I zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. I wish I could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe I could pay attention in class. But no. I have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. I seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. I was going to use a bad word, but I don't know if that would be appropriate. I wonder if it would affect my grade if I did write a cuss word. Is that how you spell cuss?  Maybe I should have just wrote curse. And why do I always have to fix the word just?  Every time I type just without paying close attention I put an extra j in between the u and the s. It makes me feel quite stupid. Time just ran out. I'm glad because I want to just go to sleep and forget about people  I will never have to see again. 
__label__label1      Today is the first football game, I'm pretty excited. Idon't really know the drill so  hopefully my friend willcall. I wonder if there is a parade, that'd be cool I could go  listen to the band, I miss band band was fun if I don't make the dance team I'm  definately going to try  out for band, although my lips are so fat  I can't believe PROPNAME  said that about my lips sometimes I really wonder about that kid, he sure does tell  a lot of stories, I mean seriously he couldn't have gotten kicked out of new orleans  theyll take anyone over there, youd have to do a whole hell of a lot to get kicked  out of there I wonder how megans doing in alabama she found a new male friend I  wonder about her and jason if they are going to stay together they are one of  those couples that are going to stay together forever save a nuclear winter. I wish I  could be like that but at the same time I'm having fun I guess, I really miss griff, he  always made me smile even if it was something stupid, I need to go visit him at  atm I wonder how much different it is over there if it really is a bunch of cowboys  like I picture it I wonder if erin likes it since she's not into the whole spirit cowboy  thing, I think she would do so much better here with me! plus I mjust miss erin. she  was so cool I loved our no pants parties, they were fun bonding time. man 00 min  is longer than I thought suck town usa, I think this assignment is kind of cool to track  your htoughts for 00 min, it just proves further how random I am, I'm hungry, I think  I'm going to have a pb&j when I'm done, that's the stuff with strawberry jelly. strawberries whiten your teeth that is so cool I need to start using my crest white  strips again, I need to take a shower, man I forgot how far away kirby lane isthat  power walk made me all nappy. that's ok I'm sure ill get even nappier at the f-ball  game amin is so hot, man did I luck out on getting a counselor, nate was so cool  too! I'd totally date nate. that's the kind of guy I'm looking for, random funnyness  facial expressions everything someone that canjust make me laugh up a storm. OTherwhise ill get bored. I kind of want someone like griff though too. Although if I  dated griff I'd be really scared. Idon't know why, idon't htink he'd ever cheat on  anyone but he never wants a girlfriend. manhes good. really strong. he can bench  press me that's amazing I need to work out I don't want that nasty freshman 00. I  don't think ill get it I walk around campus like hardcore. its a big campus I like it  though I like getting lsot in it all its definately puts me in my place. which is nice. no  more trying to be something imnot. I hope I can find an organization to be in. the  wrangler darlins would be pretty awesome and pals would be pretty cool. I  wouldlove to get a really hot italian boy. man that would be cool. like hardcore  awesome. like paolo or davide or vincente that would be awesome this takes a  long time I'm having trouble trying to fill up the time I wonder when my roommate is  going to wake up its like 0:00 in the afternoon. PROPNAME take a nap I think I will. naps  are the greatest. I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome. especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool. I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad. good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 00  min and 00 seconds. sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 0. 0 at least my mom made a  0. 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time. I never really realized how hard she must have worked. its  college that makes you realize stuff like that 
__label__label1 I am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. I like that movie 00 first dates. I said that because I'm watching t. v. oh I already said that. well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. I pray to God that she's. I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer. I watching the monk. I love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it. I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown. I am almost half way through this writing assignment. I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them. I forget how many hours I need. Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 0 hours. I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel. I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. PROPNAME is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. I hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on ORGNAME. I got to find something a little better to watch. I just changed to what not to wear. I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress. I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling. I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery. I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. I would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because          
__label__label1      Stream on consciousness, this is something I have done before, when I was writing my diary, I though it'd be a cool idea, I wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend. He's a good guy, I miss him sometimes, well I do but I don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like I know I do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything I wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though I'm not sure, I guess well last a long time, I mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until I really think about it. then its much longer. even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow. you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all. I tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but I always inevitably move on, I wonder if that's what veryone's like. if they all reflect on their thoughts like I do, then move on. or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next. there has to be someone like that, somewhere. maybe in china or some other country, but some where. I refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 00% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not. That's just the way I think. Ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach. I'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use. Woah, a mental stumble in words, I wonder how oftne I do that? I don't think I realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- I like foreign languages. rightnow I'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one I'm most versed in. I think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and I have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own. I used to think when I was a little kid that that would be impossible- then I though itd be incredible, now that I can do taht it just seems like fun, I like it, it feels. Comforting somehow. I'm not sure why. it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though I'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven. I find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of. Medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when I was younger. I suppose I've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life. its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time. perhaps only to point me in another direction. (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, I wonder why. maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out. I wonder if there's a pattern. (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern. not lit. lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well. worth a shot. I search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like. that one police officer told me I sounded like a doctor. he asked me what I was going to ut to be and I said I was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said "You sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak" I though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical. I am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when I say them they come out right, and not only that but I love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen I'm in an argument I try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all. for instance I try to see what the ohr person is saying and why. what makes them say that. why they say it the way they do- I'm going to like this class- I like psychology. psych= mind. ology= the study of. I was in medical terminology. actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, I worked at the hospital but instead of money I got grades, particiapation grades reall. it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross. I enjoyed it- but I don't think I want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital. I think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push. they stick a little, on some letters more than others. they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser. they're not quite tahat stick at all. but still they seem so loud. The guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- I like orange soda. its my favorite color and soda, good stuff. I wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble. if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings. just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read. I wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like. what type f people they are, if people really do have type. basically, what they're like inside. ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am I really one of them? I kind of think I might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other. maybe I'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water. 
__label__label1 Ok so I just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the ORGNAME house. WOW the most pointless thing ever. I read maybe 00 pages. How am I supposed to study with 00 other girls there in the room? You don't have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where, and blahblahblah. I know they have good intentions in making us do this, but 0 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study. No one really got anything done. But hey it was fun- I got to bond more with my sorority sisters! Speaking of sorority stuff, I love it. At first, I was afraid I wouldn't like it, or that the girls wouldn't like me, but I Couldn't be having more fun. I have more friends than I thought I would have going into college, and they're real friends, too, not friends you "pay for" with sorority fees. I'm listening to music right now, and recently (as in the past couple of months) I've gotten more and more into music. I've always loved music, but ever since I dated a great guy who is a complete music person I've liked it even more. Today kyle and I (my aggie ex-boyfriend) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much. it was funny. we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because, of course, it wouldn't work. But now that we're all settled in, we still miss eachother. It got really serious really fast. it was unbelievably random. We never thought we would hook-up, but it happened and it was awesome. I hate to say it because I'm so young and I hate it when people say things like that, but I could quite possibly see myself with him after college- like permanently. That's so weird. Well, sincewe did break up, we are allowed to hang out with other people (date-wise) but neither of us really wanted to. Last week I met this really cool guy from the Woodlands-he's an ORGNAME pledge. I've gone to a couple parties with him as his date and I kind of have a crush on him. It's exciting, but at the same time, I'm far from being over PROPNAME. The whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down, but I still feel bad about it. I have constantly had this entire "soap opera" on my mind for the last week- nonstop. The cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability- you never have to wonder if he likes you, or if he's going to call and all that. With a new guy it's always like I wonder if he likes me and why didn't he call?-worrying. It's fun, don't' get me wrong, but it kind of puts ur confidence in check. I've recently gotten into Maroon 0 again. I used to love them, but working at LOCNAME and hearing the entire CD all the time made me hate it. I don't work at LOCNAME anymore, so I havent heard Maroon 0 in awhile, and now I love them again. 
__label__label1 well another week of classes has started and I can't wait until this weekend. I just want to relax for a while. there is so much to do during the week. I start on one thing then I have to work on something else. there is like ten million things to do. I am taking these hard classes and I hate them. I have to read a lot of course, but oh well. I have a quiz tomorrow in my Bio 000 discussion class. gosh I hope am ready. I really want to do well. its my first quiz. am going to be nervous. I did study some last night. I am extremely tired because I stayed up late looking over stuff for bio 000. I feel I am not fully prepared. but then I study so hard I go take the quiz and what if I fail. I hate that feeling. I study so much but then my hard work wont pay off. I feel so awful that I cry, I know crying doesn't do anything. but its just you work so hard and you want to do well. I am going to study some more tonight though. I want to go over to jester and go to the learning center for my calculus homework due soon. gosh so much to do today. right now am just tired and hungry. I ate junk food last night. the cafeteria was closed and I just didn't feel like going down to the strip by myself. I just always want someone there with me. I am scared though to walk on the strip by myself. maybe this weekend I will walk on the strip in the afternoon by myself. I want to go look at the stores and just walk and chill out. I am just stalk in this cubicle just putting my head into the books. its like I need to get out get some fresh air. its just am so stressed and I know I got too much to do its like I don't even have 00 minutes to just relax. there is so many things to do on campus and I want to join clubs and get to know some new people. I want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a Persian club. that would be fun. I want to meet some Persian people on campus since I am Persian too. its fun to meet someone from your own culture. you can relate to them and stuff. I just need to get out there and explore my possibilities. I need to join some clubs not just for writing in you resumes but for fun and to learn and explore and also to meet people who are also interested in the same things you are. I want to go to the medical field so I need to join some medical organizations. I am sure there are many of them. I am a biology major and now am thinking to change my major to psychology. I think psychology will be an interesting field. I talked to my cousin who recently graduated from medical school and she said it would be a great idea. I want  to do something that I am interested in and like to study. biology is hard but any subject is hard, but now the classes am taking I am just not having fun and its really stressing me out and I want to do something that I will enjoy. and I want to get into medical school. I am sure every person who applies to medical school like probably most of them are biology majors. I don't want to be a biology major. I want to stand out. I want to be different. I also think that if I don't get into medical school then what am I going to do with a biology major besides teaching and maybe working in the lab, but is it really what I want to do? if I don't get into medical school am sure there are many possibilities with a psychology major. I can go to graduate school and such and maybe be come a psychologist. I think that would be more fun and interesting. gosh all am thinking about now is how hungry I am, ha-ha. I didn't eat any breakfast this morning even though I have lots of junk food in the dorm room, that I can eat. I will wait another hour or so to go have lunch with my roommate. my next class isn't until 0000. so I have plenty of time until then. I am going to study some more for my quiz on tomorrow and maybe I will eat something to before lunch, because right now I am way too hungry. I am glad I have some food in here. its not healthy but I am just way too hungry. I want to take a nap too, but am not going to I will try to go to bed early tonight maybe. well see how long it will take to finish up at the learning center. hopefully I can be done by 0 or 000. I am going to leave the dorm around 000 or so, so I can be at jester by 0. I want to finish my calculus homework so I wont have to worry about it that much. I already got enough stuff to worry about and do. I just want tomorrow to be over with. after tomorrow's quiz I think I will be okay. 
__label__label1 I am sitting here thinking about what I am going to eat . I am very hungry. for lunch i had a sala, some pasta and some soup, oh that guy was really hot . when I work out today those guys are going to be really hot too. oh god something stinks. i wonder what it is . I hope its not the person sitting next tome. what is that girl wearing she looks very tacky. when I go to my dorm later I am going to fall out. First I have to call my parents or they will get mad . this is a library why are people walking around and talking so much. I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink. oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important. Last night the ORGNAME music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip. I absolutely loved what PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME were wearing. I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon. Man I hope I did good on my Spanish quiz it was fairly easy I think. What classes do I have tomorrow hopefully easy ones because I can't stand some of my classes. i wonder what my roommate is doing right now. I wonder if my exboyfriend has a girlfriend right now. man when will this be over 00 minutes is a long time to just write about anything. ooh another hot boy oh and there is his girlfriend. That's okay I look better than her anyways. I wonder what my friends are doing in LOCNAME LOCNAME maybe I'll give them  a call when I have time. I'm so excited the first football game is this week what am i going to wear who am I going to go with Hopefully we will beat north LOCNAME. oh my god games mean after parties and after parties mean really hot football players too bad I'm only 00 I can probably still get into some clubs. the ones that allow babies. Man it seems like I have been on here for years when is this crap going to end. wow my stomach just growled really loud, hopefully no one heard me but if they did ohg well I know they are probably having the same problem. I wonder what my brother is doing I wonder if he quit the football team yet I told him he should just do track but he didn't believe me so that is his fault, but he'll learn they always do. I wonder did my mom send my money for my ATM because I know I could still use it Oh crap the time is almost up I thought my brain would explode 
__label__label1 twenty seconds and I still haven't thought of anything. PROPNAME is crazy for taking all those chemistry classes! I couldn't even work on my math problems, and concentrate. I don't know how she makes it all those hours with science and math. We're going to watch that movie tonight, in a little while, so I need to finish my homework pretty soon, and get a head start on the week, so I don't have too much to worry about. I need stop freaking out the ghost in our community bathroom! Those shower curtains don't open themselves! I wonder is molly is going to be happy for me and jen about being the new wing representatives? wow that's a big word. I wonder if that's how you spell it. I need to clean up my room before my roommate throws my stuff out in the hall. Stupid jose can't really mean what he said. He said he's not IN love with me, and just loves me. But I know we'll get back together. I'm sure of that. Now. . Whhooooahhhh I clicked that button too many times. I really hope they don't run out of the poster I want. I signed up to work for 0 hours at the poster sales to get $00 worth of credit for that poster starry night. wow that hairstyle's weird. That guy must work hard to get it like that. maybe I should stop looking out the door. it's too quiet in here, since jen doesn't listen to her music out loud. I love that people miss me back home, and that makes me feel like I was someone back there. the more I look around this room, the more I like the color purple. I remember the superman theme from stucco, and the way PROPNAME looked in his cape. I wish I had my photo album with me right now to show jen. mmmmmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa the eyes of LOCNAME are upon you. . Today's lunch was super cool, because me and jen went back to the buffet, where she saw her friend who also happens to be Hispanic too! I was so glad when I saw Hispanics here. I need to add more people to my yahoo, because I only have four people. I don't know why more people here don't have messenger, like people back home. this is so cool, because it keeps you thinking, and you see it right in front of you. This is so much fun, I should do this more often and then find the pattern of what I seem to think about more often. darn! my time is already running out. this was fun. I'm down to like 00 seconds. I hope I did this assignment right. 
__label__label1 I finally got to see Matrix: Revolutions. I don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful. It's funny, everyone I've talked to that loved the 0nd one hated the 0rd one and everyone that hated the 0nd one loved the 0rd one. I'm in the latter category. I've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now. I think it might have to do with our expectations. I loved the first one. I was waiting for the second one to come out ever since I heard they were making a trilogy. I had good expectations for Reloaded, and I went to the theatre to see it on opening night and I was disappointed. The interesting thing is that about a month earlier, X-Men 0 came out. I liked the first one a lot, but I wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 0nd one to come out (like how it was with Reloaded). My expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent. I hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect. When I went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away. After about an hour and a half had gone by, I checked my friend's watch because I was worried the movie would end soon.         Enough Matrix talk. I just got back from LOCNAME, and I got to see PROPNAME PROPNAME. Hmmm. It might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an "illusionist" and all. I saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that I'm very proficient in visual media. I think it might be because I've seen all of those Goddamned behind the scenes "documentary" stuff for the extended versions of Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. In a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use. Maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface. I had a point to this. PROPNAME. Yeah, it was fun. I found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological "illusions. "  What I mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show. Again, it might've been better if I had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks. The older audience members must have been stumped.          PROPNAME's very cute. He's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, I don't know. Next hour at the most.  Whenever I'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my CD book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot. Instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me. Big difference!  Before I'd moved the computer onto where it is now, I had it closer to the bed on PROPNAME's desk. PROPNAME would spend most of his time while I was on the computer on the corner of my bed. Er, sorry. AMANDA'S bed. I still can't get over the time when I talked to her (a very rare time since the Kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and I took her old apartment) and I was so excited that I'd bought this silky linen for, and I quote, "my bed. "  "You mean MY bed," she said. "I bought it. You're only keeping the things in that apartment while I'm gone working on the campaign. "  Bullshit. When we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, "Oh, I have to go now. I need to go to my mom's bed. or what I should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though I sleep in it every night. "  Yeesh!  She's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent. I hope she'll get over it, because I really resent the fact that she believes I'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers. For some reason that really bugs me. PROPNAME's awake and about now. It's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while I'm typing. My times up anyway, so tah!
