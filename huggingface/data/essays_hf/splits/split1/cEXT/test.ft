__label__label0 I had just returned from other interesting dinner experience at my frat house when I realized that I was just wasting time as usual. So I decided I'd turn on the old computer and do a little stream of consciousness writing. I'm sitting down at my knew desk, that to tell you the truth, has done me no good except for a good place to put my computer. My roommate, an old friend I've know throughout my life is out doing his fraternity B. S. and probably won't be back until twelve. This I really do think is funny because coming into school I was completely busy from day one, while he just sat on his beanbag chair and watched t. v. To tell you the truth all I really care about any more is the amount of time I get to spend sitting in my beanbag chair watching t. v. Although it's not really as fun as it may seem, because while sitting in the beanbag chair the only thing on your mind is when you're going to have to get up and go do stuff. I realized today in class that when one begins to get about half the amount of sleep that he used to get it does become a little bit irritating and depressing. All I can think about is when I can rest may days have turned from full productive days with good night sleeps over the summer to half ass, sit around and make up excuse my I shouldn't leave the room so I can get some sleep worthless days. I'm pretty sure that last sentence made absolutely no sense, so on that last thought I think  I'm going to leave the room for the umpteenth time today and go do things that I really wish I could accomplish by getting into bed and closing my eyes. 
__label__label1 always a problem. My hair is really wet and I should go dry it, but this assignment is what I need to do now. I almost slept through my eight o clock class, but I somehow made it. Ok this show keeps getting cheezier and cheezier oh dear. I have to cash a check and deposit it so my check book balances, which is something that needs to be done and really quickly because I will have to pay extra for all the hot checks I have written- uh oh. My twenty minutes probably seems shorter because I am a slower typist than most people. PROPNAME is a psycho whore, I hate hate her. Something shocking happens on this show every 0 seconds. I don't think that Days of our lives is a good show, but I seem to be addicted to it anyway. PROPNAME is so nice and her and LOCNAME are finally together, but probably not for long because there is s 
__label__label1 I am in the computer, I wish I’m I bed right now, God I'm tired. Are my doing this right I sure hope so. Do I need to hit return after each line. Man this is harder than I thought. only 0 mins past. I wanna go  eat lunch now. Boy I type fast. That girl is really good looking, I wonder what her name is. That music is  really loud will you please turn it down!  The computer lab is closing in 00 mins, I think I can finish before then. Man this is weird, writing down want you are thinking. I need to go back to LOCNAME and bring my basketball here. I missed my room. Need help?  The lab assistant is there to answer any of your questions, yeah right, that  girl here yesterday was no help at all. I wish I have a computer in my dorm. I wonder if my roommate is still asleep. I should be sleeping to. I think I did this in high school, but I’m not sure if it's the same thing. I really need this ten points, so I better get a good grade on this. I missed PROPNAME, I wish she's here with me  right now. I wanna an ice cream. Boy this is Boring, I really do think about a lot of things. Turn the music  down damn it. Hey I like this computer. Do I need to print this out?  Boy two more papers to go. I wonder if PROPNAME will go out with me ever, nah, she's not my type any ways. Do I need to do this in Paragraphs, I sure hope not God How long do I have to do this. I'm thinking about what do think now. yes today is the 0th. nice hat. I need  some money. Shoot, gotta do my math homework later, man this sucks. I gotta go eat lunch before my next class, how much  time left for this thing? I think he got the same class with me. Where is PROPNAME, we gota do the topic thing together. I wonder what is on TV today. I think the computer lab is about to close. Can they tell how long I have been writing this? I don't wanna go to Jester West. Cute girl. nice mouse pad. I really need a computer. Man she is tall. I really think I did this in High School. Today is the ORGNAME award, yes. Oh no, I gota a meeting session, I think I’ll skip it. I can't, I got to  turn in my homework, man this is not good. How long has been. I really should have kept track of time better, I Think is been  00 mins now. I'll write a little more just in case. I hope my friends waited for me to go to lunch, they better. I need to go to the gym  again today, do I have enough time?  The lab is kinda empty now, may be I should go too. I'm sure it's been 00 mins at least. okay five  more mins and I’ll go to lunch k. What is he writing over there, I think it's a web pager. Why didn't this web pager work yesterday? nice screen saver, I think I’ll get one too when I fix my computer. I wanna a lap top. I'm getting sleepy and I just woke up too, boy this is boring. Do I really think about all these different thing before, nah. okay the lab is closing, I think I should go to lunch now bye. Yes, one down two to go. 
__label__label1 I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at ORGNAME ORGNAME and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 00. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 00 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my "big sister's" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else. 
__label__label1 So what should I write? I have no clue. Oh, about the survey I did in the  class today. It's pretty good. I mean I like the one on homosexuality. I  am gay, and I know my answers are very biased. To me, I either strongly  agree or strongly disagree. Hey, it's about my identity and the society  I am living in. I have to, sort like, defend for what I believe in,  although I don't have much choices in picking my own identity. What am I  thinking? Why am I so excited about it? I have come out for a rather long  period of time, yet I am still nervous about the whole issue. I am a very  lucky guy, I have not met a lot resistance from the society as a whole. Somehow, I only have the problem finding the right guy. When I was young,  I have those innocent thoughts about love and romance. I have always  believed that there definitely is a right guy for me. Yeah, that was a huge joke. As I become more mature, I become more practical, just like everyone  else. All right, I shall only speak for myself. I know love to me is a  pathetically realistic concept. No more space for imagination. God, why am  I writing this? I had just promised myself to forget about the existence  of love, right after the PROPNAME issue. It shall not work for me. I am too pretentious, arrogant, determined, etc. Anyway, moving on to something else. Man, there are 00 more minutes left. The sky is so dark. I wonder what is  out there. I know one thing is that I am not scared of anything. I want to  know, I want to discover, I want to enjoy life beyond it's practical  dimensions. There is the moon. No, I am lying. The moon is not visible at the beginning of the month. Well, I wish I could see it though. I have  heard enough Chinese stories about the angels on the moon. I hope I can live there sometimes. The earth is too complicated, and it is also very cruel. I just want to go somewhere and forget all the problems and relieve all the  stress. I really just want to be with my closest friends for a little while  and leave everything else alone. Oh, not possible. Why am I writing this. I swear to God that I have never been so senseless before. My fingers are  typing things which my mind cannot direct. Weird, I need help. Maybe this  is the point of this assignment, to get lost and throw away the conscious. Ok, 0 more minutes. What am I going to do this weekend? How about 0th  street. I really like Paradox. The music is good and so is the place. Yep, that's it. Friday night hanging out with pals. Cool. Maybe I can meet some cute guys. Oh, come on, my brain is out. My roommate is home. Finally. I gotta go, time is up, my fingers are little tired. Bye. 
__label__label0 right now I feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time. The title of the movie is Event Horizon in which a ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through a dimension warp. My brain feels completely clouded over because I don't really want to start school. I also want to bet on football pretty badly. This past weekend I lost a pretty nice piece of change while none of my teams covered the spread. I hope to do much better this weekend, but it has me worried.     My toe also seems to be giving me trouble because it got infected about one year ago but it never seems to get all the way healed. Maybe there is a chance that it will give me problems for the rest of my life. I'm pretty tired right now since it is 0:00 in the morning. I feel I have had a productive day though because I went to class today and got meaningful information from them. Especially in this class. I usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting. I liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life. It has also just hit me that Mr. PROPNAME said he was from midland, which is also my hometown. I think its a pretty good place, you just have to have a little imagination that's all. I'm thinking that since I ran so much this evening my back might actually be sore because of it. Hell, I don’t know though. I could use a nice woman in my life right now, but I am extremely picky unless I've been boozing it a little. It is cold somewhat in my room right now and there are many things that I must take of before tomorrow. I need to do some laundry and do some reading for class. I get extremely irritated when things don't operate smoothly. I wish I knew more about computers so that I could take care of my email problem. A nice cheeseburger would be excellent right now but I don’t really want one do to the fact that I'm trying to lose a few lbs. I’m debating whether or not to turn the TV on and watch a movie or just go straight to bed. Last night I almost got in a fight with one of my pledge brothers and to tell you the truth. I think the guy knows I could have killed him because he is not crazy enough to take me. I'm really not in a position            do some work for a good cause. I need a damn job so I can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with my parents. One thing I've noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs. I mean I've sat down and talked bad about probably everyone I know. People pick out one person's weakness or what they consider to be a weakness and bash them pretty good when they aren’t around. I know people say stuff about me when my back is turned but hey so did i. I figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies. That is bullshit. I've been writing now for 00 minutes I’ll stop. is there any that I could  
__label__label1 Well, here I go, writing for 00 minutes. This really feels weird, but I  guess I have to do it. Actually I am glad I am doing this assignment because I dreaded doing it and now I can get it over with. It's just that 00 minutes seems like such a long time to sit here and write about nothing. I just don't know what to do and I feel very uncomfortable. Hmmm. Princess PROPNAME died early this morning. I have felt so sad. When I first heard of her car accident last night I tried to pray for her, but I felt as she would not want to live but rather die. I have been reading and studying about near-death experiences and most people studied/interviewed have said that they usually do not want to come "back" after being pronounced dead. Anyway, I think she is in a better place, hopefully there will be no media hounding her wherever she is at now. The ceiling fan in this room bothers me when it is on high. Sometimes I'd rather be hot than have to hear the loud roaring noise. My dogs just came upstairs. I wonder what they are thinking about?  Do they think like we do?  What could be going through their minds?  I know I am supposed to write without worrying about grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. , but I do, and I try to correct everything as I go. I keep looking at the clock and time is going very slow. I notice we have two clocks now on the desk. One is new, a prize or rather a gift for purchasing something. This room has so many things in it. I wish it was a bigger room. I like spacious things, I hate to feel crowded. I seem to be complaining so much right now, I guess I am tired and a little sleepy, and get grumpy. Why do we have some many things!  So many papers, junk, wiries, toys things, things, things!  Do we need all these things?  Can we live without all this things?  Yes, we can! Thank God! I can't stop writing but I would like to. Oh well. I just thought about a bakery, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME bakery to be exact. I keep craving sweets, so maybe that is why. I saw a white cake with pink frosting. My sister also came to mind. Hmmm, this is interesting because she is a professional baker and creates luscious deserts!  It is so dark outside, I hate having the windows closed, I like to hear the outdoors. I love the outdoors. Oh God 0 more minutes of this. I just feel like my mind is completely empty right now. I wonder if this happens when one is really tired?  I feel very old today. I like this computer, I guess I am pretty lucky to own one. I'm sorry I have been so negative, but this is how I feel right now. However, my time is up , hip hip hooray! Bye!  
__label__label1 Stream of consciousness, I just ate breakfast and my stomach hurts, my stomach hurt when I got in my first accident two years ago. stupid car, I got in a wreck just recently I was going down the road and I came to a usual stop behind a car sat there for about 0 sec an the stupid ford ranger just came billowing into my rear end and crushed it, what are you looking for, would this be considered paranoia,  why do you care so much about what I am thinking, I want to go home some times but to the home you see in movies, the ones with home cooked meals and clean rooms or even sofas to sleep on and it would be a good experience. I really want a dog, my do at home really sucks, she is old and acts like a cat, a robber came into our house a few years ago and the dog peed on itself the ran away, stupid dog. do you think I hold allot of hostility, I like to portray I don't care what anyone thinks, but that is not always true because some time to reach my goal I have to care a little bit, stupid hormones. you probably will not even read this so I guess it really does not matter exactly what I say. I wonder how long these things usually are, mine based on the amount of time I have spent writing will be four lines long, but those are some really long lines. I thing the guy next to me is hitting enter, so his is longer than mine. you know your class is too big it is hard to get any interaction so it gets boring. I tell my friend he has , he is not my friend, but I tell him he has no tact, but when I think about it neither do I and I grub with my money because I do not have much of it too spend I am 'a broke bitch!!' actually my lines are probably going to add up to about 0, but that is cool, the gut next to me has not written for 00 min, but hey jip the man, that is my motto, take as much as you can and get your moneys worth, I leave the lights on all the time in my dorm room because I want to waste electricity, and I leave the water running in the sink when I brush my teeth!!  yeah jip the man. I really want a computer in my room and it is upsetting that I do not have one because I have had one all my life and I am supposed to start right now not having one what kind of cruel god designated the lot in my life for. I want to learn to hack into very large computer and take control of them, haha!! I will the most powerful man in the world,  my and my delusions of grandure@idiot. com. what ever, I figured out that that could be take as an insult, doesn't surprise me though, people take to much to the heart these days!  this girl I met she is a room mate of a friend of mine, but she is constantly telling people about her promissory ring and about her boy friend, but then after a party she messes around with my best friend, it is not that I am jealous of he so much that he got to mess around with her but the fact she did it at all, he gets some much action. I kind of respected her bitchiness, but then she had to go off and just go back on everything she said. dork. I am kind of jealous of the fact that PROPNAME messed, really broke her, that is kind of cool, and I wish I got to do it just for the reason of doing it. I really need to get a girl friend, I want some one I can rely on every once on in a while. beats the hell out of me,  girls are too confusing. music can control my feelings, NIN can send an adrenaline rush at me hard core. I drink too much when I drink. I do not drink all the time it is just when I do I drink too muck of it, so nothing can stop me now. I am out, this is cool I might do this again. later. 
__label__label0 My neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. I went to PROPNAME and the lab was closed, that stunk. I'm very tired because I did not get very much sleep last night. Some girls on my wing and I were going to go to some Frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. It turns out one of my roommate’s friends is also in this psy. class, I thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. I haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at LOCNAME, I really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. The ORGNAME are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!!  I worked for them for about nine months, so I am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 00 years or so. I was able to get him a bluebook autographed by PROPNAME PROPNAME for Father's Day this year!  I really enjoyed giving that to him I love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!!  I love to make people happy and some people think I'm crazy for that, but I think it's great. That's another reason I have enjoyed my intern ship with the ORGNAME so much. When I get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the ORGNAME will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. Let's see 0 more minutes of writing. My roommate and I were talking about our special talents, I told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!!  Yes, if I walk down LOCNAME, I WILL fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 00 people that happen to be walking by!! That is something else, hey!! I just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. This is a man who says he cannot send me $000 a month, but can take a two week vacation to LOCNAME LOCNAME and buy a new car in the same month!! Anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 0 more minutes of writing, I can handle it, hey I'll bet you can tell I'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! Well it sure has been great talking to you. And as our good friend PROPNAME would say: Goodbye and good luck.     
__label__label0 Well I am sitting here in my room and it's about 0:00 PM. My roommate  is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. Last week my boyfriend hooked up the Ethernet on my computer. After trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. It seemed to be working, well all of the programs  were working but when I went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. It said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key  to terminate a program that wasn't working, well I pressed a key and the screen was frozen. What's wrong!!!!  I restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. Today I turned the computer on and it did the  same thing. I called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour I finally go help, well I guess you can call it help. He couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for Friday with someone who will help me. Hopefully I can get this thing figured out. I just bought this computer a few months ago and  it was very expensive. Well enough about computers. I am a little tired. I had an 0 o'clock class, after the class though I came back to the room and took a  nap until 00:00. I think that made me even more tired. Well I need to start reading my English. I have a book I have to finish by Thursday. I am half-way through, but there's still 000 pages to go. I hate reading!  I read slow and it takes forever. That's not very good for an English major. I should enjoy to read, especially  because I will be doing a lot of it in the future. I am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. This is a big change, I am very close to my  family and it was hard to leave them. I am 0 0/0 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. I went home this weekend. I was glad to be home. I'm not sure if I like this place yet or not. I think it will take a little time. At least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. That's a positive thing. The bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. Babies so they're everywhere under the sink. It is really gross. I never saw roaches before so I freaked out. The weird thing is that we don't  have any open food, I guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also  dark under there. We put a request in to have someone come and spray. They  haven't yet. I hope they come soon!  Well my time is almost up. This was really  weird just writing off of the top of my head. Actually it's kind of peaceful because I enjoy typing. Well I have my psychology class next, at 0:00 PM. I need to get ready for class. I need to check if they got the books in yet. Last Friday they didn't have the book in. Well my time is up so I will submit now. Until the next assignment. see you later!!!!   
__label__label0 Today was a good day I enjoy life. I wish I was at home with my girlfriend. she is so pretty I am in love yet it is not here. I wish that she could be here to join me. Frat life is demanding yet it should be a good payoff in the near future I wish I could sleep I am so tired that it is hard to stay awake at times during the day I really enjoy this kind valentine assignment it lets me express my true feelings  and thoughts with no real worries except that if it will arrive when it needs to. 00 minutes is a long time to write continuously but it really is neat to think off all the things that go on in my head. like home and vlentina. that is her name the lovely girl that I left back home when I came to college. I am scared that I will not do as well as I can I hope so I don’t want to let me dad down he is very important to me even though he is a bit scary at times. but that is how they are supposed to be right? oh well I hope my dog is doing ok I love her so my thoughts drift now into wanting to be on some other planet that is why I love astronomy. even thought it is kind confusing. but it is fun nonetheless I love to use the internet I think that it is so neat. I do however wish I could find a good use for it. all I ever do is waste time going from place to place not knowing where I am going. kinda like life we seem to wander from place to place and never seem to  truly settle down at least that is the way things seem right now in a few years  however I am sure that my opinion will change. I know that once I can complete college which is my number one goal above all else. then to have fun and party. I hope this week we will have a good party I know we will. we always have the best parties. and there  are always girls there. yet I do wish that valentina could be there. even though  she did start to bother me before I left. now it seems that we have gotten closer at the same time that we are apart. is she the girl for me? I do not know and whish  that I did. it seems that way at times. yet then at other times she just bugs me to death an \d all I can think of is getting away from her. I never want to loose her though. I do really care for her. I am looking forward to seeing here soon on my birthday she will stay with me I hope. but I will probably not see her that much since I am so  busy I guess I will just have to make the time to see her. I hope that she loves me I really do. I miss my parents and my old room. my room i\ here is great and I have  fun with my roommates all of whom are from my home in fort worth. so we get along well not like some of the girls that came here boy they cant stand each other and we have only  been here for 0 weeks. not even a full month. I cant believe I am writing this much I normally cannot write this much when working on a paper but now I can I guess I don’t really have to think about what I am writing just write it. I think that it is neat . wow that was a fast 00 minutes. I can't believe that it is over oh well I still have on more assignment to do. 
__label__label1 I wish it was Friday actually I wish it was next Friday then I would be going home vacuums really bug me I want to change the channel but I don't want to get up but duck tales really sucks and even though I’m not even watching it and just hearing it bugs me I guess that's something you just have to deal with if you're lazy I want to talk to PROPNAME but I don’t want to call him because I called last but he hasn't called me which really doesn't make much sense but guys don't make any sense anyway so its ok I don't want to go to calculus tomorrow but I should because I’ve already missed it twice I wish it would rain I want to get caught in the rain I want some Dr pepper but I don’t want to go buy some because I don't want to spend the money I want to get an exhaust even though I haven't even found anybody to race up here I should write to PROPNAME I need to check the mail who cares about the kennedys I hope I have some mail but I really doubt it I never get mail my room looks so boring I don't like living in a dorm it really sucks but I guess this is better than jester it's kind of hard to think and write at the same time I hate typing why are her clothes still hanging there what's wrong with using the dryer I need to do laundry double your pleasure double your fun my boobs itch I guess I shouldn't have tanned for so long     
__label__label0 and now its time to write about this wonderful stream of consciousness stuff  that we learned about in our high school English class and about all the greats  like william faulkner. you know, its kind of annoying that I should have to  hit enter at the end of each line as though this were a typewriter, you might  look into the text instructions for this window in the original scripting to see if it can be made to auto-return like some of the others do, but this is still a  rather well laid out page and method of submitting a psych project. kudos to  you. I wish my other teachers would do this. so what am I thinking about. well there's the LOCNAME/Pittsburgh football game on TV right now. I have  no idea whose winning or anything like that because I’m not really paying THAT much  attention to it or anything but LOCNAME did make a great touchdown a while ago (aha! Washington’s in the lead thirteen to seven) marvelously exciting I know. lets see. what else. well now here's a good one. I have to write this bioethics paper about an case  study (why don’t the delete options work properly in this window) on this couple who undergo an "amniocentesis" test on their newly discovered child (don’t worry its still in her womb) and they find out that the child has a genetic disorder  called turner syndrome. what I have to do is write about this case and give my  Prof. an opinion one way or the other as to whether the couple should abort  the fetus or keep it. which means in turn that I have to come to some sort of  conclusion as to my beliefs on abortion. what a task. what a mind-consuming task but then maybe I shouldn’t tell you that I’m thinking of something other than my  psych writing, but then again, I don’t imagine you would expect us (I’m not  referring to myself as us, but rather the class (hate for you to think I’m schizo  or something)) to focus directly on the task at hand since as best as I can tell the task at hand is not focusing on the task at hand quite specifically so and another thing, whenever fox sports shows a little window w/ player stats they play this obnoxious little theme music blurb on piano and I've heard it at l a million times and its starting to grate on my brain or something. so back to biomedical ethics: everything that I have been taught tells me that abortion is wrong for all the  reasons and everything, but is it fair to bring a life into the world w/ such a  condition. but then again, there are many things much worse than turners  syndrome. like what if she was born a democrat. that would suck. and now my friend from back home has just sent me a message on icq. she’s a nice person. not incredibly attractive but very loving and compassionate. but none the less, a wonderful friend. she’s still at home right now b/c she’s going to ORGNAME and school doesn’t start until like the end of September or something. she got  a job but I think she’s still bored as hell just sitting around talking with  the little kids who are still in high school and she gets to hear them complain  about the orchestra director and all that nonsense. I just explained to her  what I’m doing. the internet is a wonderful thing I think. I can talk to a  friend for free in almost real-time over icq (another great thing in the internet) any time that I want to. and now there's one of those funny PROPNAME PROPNAME commercials on TV. they’re just a hoot. well, my twenty minutes are just almost up, so I think that ill be off now. its been real fun chatting with you. have a nice day and all that. 
__label__label0 I have done these things before and I really don't think that they work. I had to do one in English one time and I hated it. I guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now I will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. I love scream, its on the tv right now and I like this movie. ;  I here that the second one is do out this winter so I’m excited. I really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. The brain is so complex. I used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew I was thinking about itself. Hmmm, I don't know what to say  exactly. I am gonna play some pool after I get done writing this paper. I have a pool table at home so I am probably better than average but lately I've been playing worse and worse. It really frustrates me too. I hate when I don't play basketball for a while because then I go back and I'm just A LITTLE OUT OF RYTHEM OR I MISS A SIMPLE SHOT OR SOMETHING. Recently I have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and I feel bad about that because I always pre0ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. I'm being A BIT Distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. I don't know I f  I can really   fill up another ten minutes but I guess I can because I have to. It really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because I've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so I don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines I don't know if I agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because I know I don't think of sex that much. Imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny A hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. I often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. I wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . I coughed. ehehehehe  I think I have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. I wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get I would love to be able to read some of them . I think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. I don't know what I’ve been told . I like led zep but not all of their stuff. It is pretty good though . I wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . I hope so Oh my time is up so I'm gonna go know. Bye bye baby!!!! 
__label__label1 I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an "A" we should try to learn something for a change in LOCNAME instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 0:00? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 00 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad. She probably wouldn't want me though because I'm black. Who gives a fuck. In the goat ass. Colin's here he's hungry. BEEr dance naked bitches oops I can't stand ugly women unless they are with good-looking ones. Kiss me PROPNAME. What if your nipples were on your forehead? Piss on me I'm a dickfor.

__label__label1 And so know I begin my first assignment in psychology. I don't know exactly how to begin this but I'm giving it my best shot. Typing isn't my forte so this is going pretty slowly. My roommate just walked in and then right out as soon as I told him what I was doing. Wow, there's something on the screen besides solitaire! He must be thinking. I hope my computer gets fixed soon. It'll be so much easier being able to send this through the internet from my dorm rather than going to the ORGNAME lab and waiting for an open computer. They should have come to fix it by now. I guess they have a lot of people to help considering that I've called them two or three times already. And when the Ethernet starts working that will be awesome. Lightning fast access; no more waiting and waiting and waiting. . At least the phone lines are up and running ( in my room anyway). And not only that I got two free phone cards on the street today. I love it when they just hand out free stuff!  Uh oh, I just heard some cars screeching outside but I can't see anything from my window. I hope they're o. k. I can't leave this keyboard! Hmmmmm, I just got writer's block and I'm writing through my stream of consciousness. I wonder if that's bad. I just got a song in my head but it's not like I can write down the notes ( it's instrumental ). My gum is losing its taste, I think that I might need a new piece soon. It's Winterfresh gum. It's my favorite. I don't exactly know why it's my favorite gum, but maybe I'll find out in this psychology class. Psychology is a kind of hard word to type and it takes a little longer that some of the other words. My roommate just turned on some music. Its called Prodigy, the group that is, and they play electronic music. It sounds pretty cool, I think I'll go listen to it. 
__label__label1 Well, here  I am writing continuously for twenty minutes. The weird thing is that this keyboard is laid out differently than the one I have back home so it makes typing really difficult. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I got a cut on my finger and hitting the I button tends to hurt a little bit. I am a little concerned about coming to the end of this line but apparently it will automatically wrap my words for me. I am going on a trip to the beach tomorrow. Well at least that's the plan. We don't have anywhere to stay not to mention any food. Oh well, it hopefully will be a lot of fun. I am sitting at Mac 0. I wish they had ORGNAME's in here. That would make my life a little easier. The computer in my room crashed and I can do absolutely nothing on it right now. It's weird I have been writing for about five minutes and I am only on my third line. Well I guess that's what long lines will do to you. There were really long lines at the student computer center the other day. MY roommate was such an angel and stood in line for me when I went to class. A girl just walked in to the computer room with headphones on. I think that is a little weird. I guess she likes to listen to music and type at the same time. I guess you can do laser copies in here. I will have to remember that. I went out for coffee last night with my roommate and his girlfriend. It was a lot of fun and I got checked out by someone really cute. I wonder if this computer lady will help me figure out my e-mail in a little bit. Last time I asked she dismissed me very quickly. That shirt reminds me of ORGNAME's. The one a guy walked in here wearing. I really wonder what you are going to learn from me by reading this. Probably that I am very random, (all my friends tell me that) They also tell me I am a crack head. I'm not really, it's just an expression they use for me because I am so random and jump from subject to subject. Don't you think it's weird that we still write stop on stop signs. We could probably save a TON of paint if we didn't and besides who doesn't know that a red octagon means stop. That sounds like a really bad commercial. I have to go to class at 0:00. I feel weird telling people that I am going to Acting class. I feel very pretentious. I really think I am going to like the class though. I have been in theatre since fourth grade I just completely lost my train of thought. It got derailed you could say. I wonder what derailed it? Oh well, I guess that's what you are trying to figure out from me writing this. Life imitates art. I miss PROPNAME PROPNAME. Not really, but she is someone whom I am supposed to miss. I really miss PROPNAME. She is one of my best friends in the world. I called her the other night and when I heard her voice I could do nothing but cry. The computer lady walked by. Apparently she chooses whom she likes to help and who she doesn't. I never know when to use who and whom. I think I am going to save this really quick so that I won't accidentally lose it. Wait never mind that would lose my train of thought. I think it would at least. I really wish I could read some of the other students stream of consciousness papers. I want to see how similar they are to me. Maybe they aren't similar at all and I am the weirdo in the group. That's what my sister would like to have me believe. She pretends that she doesn't miss me but I know she does. I wonder how this whole e-mail thing is going to work. I can't wait to e-mail my dad and PROPNAME. I would e-mail my mom too but I don't know her school e-mail name. It's scary how many e-mail accounts my family has, I think the grand total is eight. Maybe nine. I don't know if my sister has one at school or not. It depends which class she is in. Nine accounts and four people. There are way to many ways to reach us. This is an odd power PC. This computer contains the fonts necessary for the software packages ORGNAME and PROPNAME. I  wonder what those are. Probably some English programs or something. At least that's what the name implies. El tiburon means shark in Spanish. I think there is an accent but I am not so sure. Fireworks are really cool. My mom and I love to go sit under them and feel the booms. A couple of years ago there was a grass fire near where we were sitting. It was kind of exciting. Not something like rescue 000 but still it was interesting for us. I hope you find this interesting and not just some drivel about me. Drivel is such a fun word. It reminds me of dribble. Well, I have to jet. I hope I didn't write for too long but It is fun getting your thoughts out on paper. Like I am doing now, Auggghhhh the insanity. Or sanity, however you want to see it I guess. 
__label__label1 I have a ton of things to do. I still need that book for MIS. I wonder  what PROPNAME is doing?  He's probably waiting for me to call him back. Man,  I'm so happy matti called. I miss her very much, I wish she still lived here. I can't wait to hang out with PROPNAME's sister and husband that should be pretty cool. The purple on this screen is sort-of pretty. I can't  believe it actually feels cool in this house, it's always so hot in here. I hope you go downtown tonight I haven't been since school started. I'm always studying or I have to wake up so early. I can't believe I'm not  swearing as I write. It's kind of a natural thing for me but I'm holding  back in case who ever reads this gets offended. I think my mom's home I wonder what took her so long to get home. Usually she is always getting  home from work early. I wonder if I'm going to get a bad grade on this because I keep pressing return, but if I don't then I have to click the  arrow buttons and that takes to much time away from my typing. Man this is getting easier as I go, I thought I'd start typing and just go blank. Why  do people ask so many questions?  I guess I do and I just don't notice it. I keep thinking of different things while I'm typing. Days Of Our Lives  was so good the other day. PROPNAME slapping PROPNAME was awesome I've been  waiting for the day for Austin to find out that PROPNAME was lying. PROPNAME  doesn't even like her anymore for not telling him that will was his son. My neck is starting to hurt. I would hate to have a data entry job, that  would get so old. It's so crazy that I asked PROPNAME about PROPNAME today and they got in a fight just last weekend. I completely forgot about  PROPNAME until I saw her best friend the other day when we went tubing. Tubing was a blast I hope we do that again before it gets to cold. I was  drunk as a skunk. that food from LOCNAME LOCNAME was good or maybe it tasted  good because I was drunk and super hungry. I wonder how many students from UT are online right now?  I bet a whole bunch. I like this new desk my  parents bought for me. It's so much nicer than what our computer use to sit on. I need to start exercising. I have a membership at world gym, and I pay $00. 00 a month and I never go. But if PROPNAME didn't work at nights then I would make him go with me. I hate going by myself, because it's  so boring if you don't have some to talk to or if you don't have headphones. My headphones broke so I guess I'm just going to keep making excuses until I get my lazy but up and workout. Right? Right. Well I'm pretty sure it's  been 00 minutes so goodbye. 
__label__label0 I sit in a chair. I wonder . I wonder about life. we have many options. to live, to die, or get cancer. cynical ideas always cross my mind. I question everything that comes my way. anything. why are dachshunds the best dogs to have. I always look for different things. like the outside world. there are some things you just can't reveal. sometimes there are no answers to questions and no questions  can answer. I can't write. I would like to be a screenwriter someday but I can not write complete  thoughts. I am really scatterbrained. I have many ideas but I am afraid that I will fail listen. I always have a ear that listens to weird noises, give me an apple. I would like to eatan apple tonight. tonight is a good a good night. tonight will be never  the same again. there will always be room to live in another night. I hope I can learn how to type faster cause I have many strange and honest thoughts  running through my mind tonight. I will think of why I am writing this. I don't want to think about it cause it will take up too much of my other  ideas. I like to read why people are the way they are. I think every body’s brain I s incredibly strange. infinity is a concept that cloud not be conceived not in this brain, or anybody else’s. some day will the word mean something or will it? that I can not explain or will try to explain or think like I know I can explain. I like to talk to people about their spirituality ideas ideas ideas. I know that I will sleep exceptionally well . I am typing this at night because I was really thinking and I am not able to put all of it on paper. listen to me listen  to me I am rambling. I am a really drained for thinking about my future. I am almost certain that I know what I want to do but  I am afraid of failing and never be able to be happy. I do have confidence, ambition and ] think that I will be successful. I have been writing/typing for at least 00 min. I could go all night but instead I will make my mind ' wander of into some other tangent. 
__label__label0   I am so glad that I came home this weekend. I really miss all of my friends and family. I feel like I need to be studying for some of my classes right now. I want to but I also want to spend time with my family. I need to go shopping today. I still need to buy an answering machine and some shower shoes. I really like ORGNAME, but I just feel so lonely sometimes. I am so used to being in high school and seeing all of my friends every day. I am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when I needed it. I really miss them. Now most of them have gone so far away and I won't see them for a long time. I am so happy that I got to see PROPNAME yesterday. I had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if I had never left. I can't believe all the things that she told me yesterday that I had never knew before. I am nervous about going back to class on Tuesday. I am so afraid that I am not going to do well in college, but I really want to . I feel like I am already behind because I have alot to do. I am starting to get hungry now. I haven't eaten all day and my stomach is starting to hurt. I can't believe that Princess PROPNAME died. It is so hard to believe. I feel so bad for her kids. I feel like I have so much to do today, but I don't know where to start. I am so tired. I want to go back to sleep. I want to go out and do something tonight. I haven't gone out in so long, and I am tired of staying home every night. I don't want to sit at home and watch TV again. I wonder if mom and dad are going to go somewhere again tonight. I hope that they don't. I would rather them just stay home with me. I wonder why PROPNAME is acting so weird. Sometimes he is nice to me, but then sometimes he won't even talk to me. I really don’t want to buy anything today. I have been spending so much money and I feel like I am running out. Maybe mom and dad will help me out and pay for a few things. I wish that the rest of my friends were here. I really miss them. When me and PROPNAME were talking about them yesterday, it made me miss them even more. Now I am feeling like I was on Friday. I was in such a dreary mood because I felt so alone. I wish I could see more people that I knew at LOCNAME. I wish that my parents would stop nagging me all of the time. Sometimes I feel that I can never do anything to please them. I ready to go back to LOCNAME. I can’t study when I am at home. There are too many thing to distract me from doing it. I am really hungry now. I think that I will go and get something to eat. 
__label__label0 I finally got into this thing. that took forever. I hate asking questions so it took even longer. I think people are always thinking weird things about me, which I know is bad , but I always do. the good thing is that everyone I've come in contact here has been really helpful. I really cant wait for this weekend. the weeks are so long. I haven’t made any new friends here. I have a lot friends that  came with me from high school to LOCNAME and to other schools in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I see them every weekend. I’m being really antisocial right now. the thing is that the friends I have are really close to me, and they know everything there is to know about me, and vice versa. I spent the last two years of my life with them, it may not seem like a lot but it was two very important years of my life. I feel really comfortable around them. I m not good at  meeting people so I cant imagine being at  the same level of friendship with other people especially in college where everyone just does their own thing. so I look forward to every weekend. people around me probably think I’m weird sitting here just typing continuously. I’m sure, actually I’m almost positive there are weirder people here. id really like to finish this already, but I just looked at the clock and I still have time left. I’m going home, back to LOCNAME LOCNAME next Friday. its going to be strange. I never expected to go back so soon. I was with this girl for about 0 months before I left, and it was really serious. we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. she was supposed to move here, but she had issues and commitments that were obviously more important. She cane to visit last month for about 0 weeks before school started. we got in  a big fight and she left on really bad terms. it was my fault, but I couldn’t have her leave on good terms or it would have hurt more. so I acted like a jerk and we fought the last week and a half she was here constantly. Anyway I’m really afraid of running into her, because ill be there for a whole weekend and we hang out a t the same places. I think its really funny how a lot of people here think LOCNAME LOCNAME is so small. its as big as LOCNAME, and no one knows it. ki heard someone say that they though it only had one high school. it actually has 00-00. oh well it rally doesn’t matter, I’m glad I’m here now. I really like it,  I cant believe I’m in college and actually grown up and that I actually have real responsibilities. but I very lonely. I miss her so much, and she wants to try the whole long distance relationship thing, but I cant. I really loved her. I've never been so close to anybody in my life, and after everything we shared and as close as we were, it seems like ill never experience that again with anybody. and if I do finally find someone and then we break up I have to go through this whole pain thing again. I know its normal to feel like this, I just moved away from a city I've lived in for 00 years and I just broke up with someone I was prepared to spend the rest of my life with, but its all a little overwhelming. the thing that bothers me the most is that all this takes up too many of my thoughts, and it takes away from what I really should be concentrating on. I really want  to do well here at LOCNAME, I have a lot to prove to a lot of people. I’m sick of always having this sob story attached to my life. I went to an all boys private school that was small compared to other high school, my graduating class was about 000. everyone knew that I moved out of my house and how I had trouble with my mom, and everyone feel sorry for me, and I’m sick of this whole drama thing, my life is so full of drama.  I went over by a few minutes I guess that’s all   
__label__label0 An open keyboard and buttons to push. The thing finally worked and I need not use periods, commas and all those thinks. Double space after a period. We can't help it. I put spaces between my words and I do my happy little assignment of jibber-jabber. Babble babble babble for 00 relaxing minutes and I feel silly and grammatically incorrect. I am linked to an unknown reader. A graduate student with an absurd job. I type. I jabber and I think about dinoflagellates. About sunflower crosses and about the fiberglass that has be added to my lips via clove cigarettes and I think about things that I shouldn't be thinking. I know I shouldn't be thinking. or writing let's say/  So I don't. Thoughts don't solidify. They lodge in the back. behind my tongue maybe. Somewhere at the point of hiding but   dinoflaghelates, protistas and what was that sea weed. I think about the LOCNAME LOCNAME valley and I think about the mushrooms in cow shit. I think about the ticos and I think about the chiggers that are living in my legs. I itch. I coat myself with clear nail polish in hopes to suffocate the bugs that are living in my legs and I remember PROPNAME. I remember LOCNAME  and I think about my thoughts and what I am not supposed to be doing in this assignment. Thoughts. I wonder if I think in sentences I wonder what affect my slowish typing has on my stream of consciousness and I wonder if there is a way that typing speed can be measured in this study  so that so link some generalization of dorky 000 psyc students. green and the table in my kitchen makes me want to vomit. orange. What an absurd color. wish I wasn't in the united state. My greencard runs out in a few years wonder what I do. I hope Dr. PROPNAME gets back in his lab because I really need to find out if he has funds to pay me. May have to go back to the library. Brainless job of nothingness that would make me wallow in the world of boredom which isn't entirely bad. Need to focus on school organics and such. Period. Two spaces after the period. Mistakes and I want to eat not hungry and I wonder how many people talk about food in there little computer ramblings  Feel open and Happy that I am not having to edit this. Type type I don't know what I am think PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME house. I remember when I went down to that . she had spiders on hurt wall pain all over the place and we painted clouds on the ceiling and the blue walls were so obnoxious. PROPNAME. Sex sex sex. yeah. This is a strange assignment and PROPNAME's complaint is ringing in my head. Eager to finish so that I can start for Whom the ORGNAME ORGNAME and get on with it. Bio and Carbon atoms bonds and orbitals. Thinking  about the electron configuration that surrounds the last letter in my first name and I think that I must have been granted a full "s" orbital  one up and one down. spinning on opposite directions and I am thinking about Scottish poetry about PROPNAME in his kilt and about my guitar that I am slowly slowly slowly learning to play. I wonder what goes on in this study. I wonder if those happy little bored entertained grad students will scan words and I wonder how I can mess up this study? Random words like . don't know. ;Me me me me me and I wish that some things were easier and I wish that I had been keeping my eye on the clock. Wondering how long I have been typing and wishing that I was finished because I need to find out if I have to / will work in the Botany lab again and all that . ILS Belly and the Flamenco. PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME kickin' it in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I hate PROPNAME's cat and wish that it could be exchanged for a worthwhile ferret. Type type type. I have managed to waste over 00 minutes of time I think. Who knows. What If I was to write this out and it took 00 minutes to write and 00 minutes to type. Thinking about nothing and wishing that some financial aid would come my way. Need a job and a sprinkling of time. Time to go and sign outta here. trees

__label__label1 here I am writing a required stream of consciousness essay. but the weird thing is that it just has to be done. it doesn't matter what I write about. right now I’m listening to some music that my parents would consider useless noise. it upsets me that they think that the music from their generation is so perfect and magical and music from my generation is crap. and they think that all of the musicians I listen to are miserable drug addicted singers. their music had its fair share of messed up people. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, the grateful dead. despite the fact that these people and other were pretty messed up, they are regarded as some of the gods of rock and roll. I just wish that they wouldn't assume that every band around now is like PROPNAME PROPNAME and nirvana. in fact, if my parents would give it a chance they might actually enjoy some of my music like PROPNAME PROPNAME band, blues traveler, and phish. but I don't want to get off on a rant here. my little window is right next to my computer and I have such a spectacular view. I get to look at the loading dock of the jester cafeteria and on occasion I get to wake up to delivery trucks dropping off some barely edible food at 0:00 am. one would think that with all of the thousands of students at LOCNAME and the hundreds living at jester center, they might have some food that tastes as good as week old liver and onions. I figured that I would be in excellent shape after a semester of living at jester because I walk everywhere, but the food at jester is so loading with fat that it doesn't matter how much you eat. if the university can afford to make millions of dollars of renovations and additions to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, then maybe the could get rid of the somewhat rancid smell in the halls and make the rooms a little warmer that 00 degrees. then they go and build a huge parking garage over a big parking lot. it seems like a good idea until you realize a couple things. about the first two levels are reserved for faculty. if you are lucky enough to get a space in the garage then you have to pay 000 dollars a semester. most of the people that are willing to spend that type of money for parking don't live in jester. they live at Dobie or university towers. of course, I don't have any personal feelings about that issue but I thought someone else should know about it. all in all though , university of LOCNAME is a great place because of a lot of things. beautiful campus, interesting people, a great sports program and , most importantly, absolutely gorgeous women. why would anyone want to go anywhere else especially in LOCNAME. a friend of mine got into duke but that was the only place that she would want to go if she didn't go to UT. Baylor: small campus, nothing to do, and you hang out with the same people from high school. LOCNAME Tech: What is in LOCNAME? and their sports program is a joke because the athletes aren’t real students. Byron hanspard, their star running back had a 0. 00 gpa in his last semester. ORGNAME ORGNAME: do I even have to explain? well my 00 minutes is up and I have to go to class. Hook 'Em Horns!

__label__label1 Okay, I’m not so sure where to begin. only that I feel betrayed. betrayed by a friend that I valued. I don't understand how it happened, but I know that things will never be the same again. I sort of thought that college might bring us closer together, but I have discovered that no matter where we are, he is a million miles away. I used to think I could get through to him, but I guess I was wrong. my friends tell me he is a part of the past, and that I should look to the future, but right now I think he just breaks my heart. perhaps I’m thinking a little to much about this. I just need to get over it. until I do, I won't be able to connect with others because I’m not reachable right now. my friends all warned me this would happen, but, as usual, I wouldn't listen. I just can't help it, I want to do things my own way. do I understand myself? no. sometimes I think that I am a total psycho and I’m surprised I haven't scared people off already. I've met some nice people, but I’m just not open for new friends right now, which is such a bad idea at this point in my life. well, it's not that I’m not open to making new friends, it's that I have to let go of the past before I can pursue anything else. the trouble is that I know he is not thinking about this as much as I am. perhaps that is what hurts me the most. just knowing that our friendship meant more to me than to him. I talk to his friend, and his friend says to give it time. I’m trying to, I swear. I’m entirely too emotional about these things, I guess. I miss my best friends. I need someone to talk to. I’m not sure about this whole sorority thing, but maybe I’ll find my friends there. who knows?  thank God all those girls don't fit the sorority stereotype. that would be hell. but some of them are actually very cool. that makes me feel better because when I first met them all, I was scared shitless. I was so afraid, I almost cried. sometimes I think about what I’m getting myself into, and I get scared again, but not like that. I’ve never been scared like that. this such a scary place for me right now. maybe if I felt secure with my friends. I just think that this one guy will never really talk to me again, and it bothers me a lot. I just need to find something else to occupy my time. I really think he thinks I’m a psycho. I’ve got to stop thinking about this. remember what PROPNAME said: don't try to force things, if it's meant to be, it will happen. I’m trying to keep that in mind, Ash. I guess everything is up to God at this point. it's all a matter of trust. At times I’m just not willing to let someone else handle it. I’ve just got to let go. of everything. this guy is not the only thing I’ve been worrying about. I worry about my best friends. all of us at different schools. I think about what they're doing and if they're drunk right now or scared. sometimes I worry about myself. I kind of have a low self esteem. this sounds strange, but I think I like it. not liking myself. I think, in a way, it keeps you from getting arrogant. but on the other hand, maybe that, too, is a different kind of arrogance. thinking about yourself all the time, whether it be good or bad. why can't I reach you?  where are you?  I've got to stop thinking about things. the trouble with me, is that I don't obsess over many things, but the ones I do, it's often and it totally eats away at my life. it can kill me pieces at a time. I’ve lost my appetite and sometimes my desire to go out. but when I’m sitting there, holed up in my room feeling sorry for myself, I know that the rest of the world is moving on without me. especially here. at college. where no one cares. oh, ORGNAME 00 is on the radio. that song really "Push" really hits me. some songs make me cry if they fit a particularly depressing aspect of my life well enough. I want to connect with other people the way that song connects with me. I just need to keep an open mind and get out there and do it. PROPNAME told me once that I need to get off my butt and do things because I’m not always going to get an invitation. this reminds me of PROPNAME off in LOCNAME. I'm so glad PROPNAME called to see if I could come home for Tim's birthday. I guess the relief lies in the security that comes from anything associated with Pre-college. but I wouldn't go back if I could. I was the one of my friends saying how excited I was to leave. and I was. I’m glad I’m here, but now that I’m here, I don't know what to do. I really like this stream of consciousness stuff, and this is not because I’m trying to kiss butt or anything, it's just that I write a lot of stuff like this to let off steam. it's my own form of closure for the problems in my life. I’m thinking about going into journalism, but who knows?  it was the ORGNAME last week. I think that if you don't have anyone to talk to, you have to at least write things down. I’m starting to be friends with PROPNAME. I hope we get to be good friends. the trouble with college is that people all know that everyone needs friends, but you can't be best friends with everyone. the friend that you find that you really relate to is rare. I’m still searching. I feel like I’m PROPNAME PROPNAME in Catcher. this kills me.  
__label__label1 Ok. Stream of. "Come as you are. I wonder if anybody actually misses PROPNAME PROPNAME. "No I don't Have a gun"?  What? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named Nirvana, whose leader shot himself. ORGNAME ORGNAME, much better group. I wonder how many people have killed themselves because of PROPNAME PROPNAME death. That takes intelligence. PROPNAME's dead, life's not worth living. Why did I wait till the day before this is due to type it. Ohhhhhh I love this song. It reminds me of my boyfriend and I. "When she says she loves me". except I don't say I love him because according to every one of my friends I'm afraid to tell him I love him. Something about a fear of commitment and love. I guess it's all supposed to be ORGNAME’s fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. " When she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love". Good song. I wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. Oh yah, classic Sting. I have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. I never really liked Sting anyway. I should really be doing my other homework. What do I have to do? English paper, read my classic civilization, read my English, study Psy notes, and phl notes. I guess I can do most of it tomorrow. Third Eye Blind. Where do they get names for these groups?  Tomorrow is another day{Go PROPNAME}. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. At least I have a decent boss for once, not some 00 year old pervert. what time is it? Wow 00 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. I wish they were all that easy. Yah right. That probably wouldn’t get me into ORGNAME ORGNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME, four more years of college. Hopefully I can get through these first four. I can do it, because I’m good enough I'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. Well it's been a great 00 min. I'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. I need to do these more than a day before their due next time. 
__label__label0 I am very excited to be taking this psychology class since I was unable to take a psych. class in highschool. I am hoping that this class will give me some  direction on my major. As of this moment I am supposed to be working towards pharmacy school, but I am beginning to think that it wouldn't keep my interest for very long.    (You know it is very hard for me to just write in my train of thought, and I don't know why. I'm not much of a perfectionist or anything)    Anyway back to psychology, Psychology really sparks my interest. In class, we discuss finding answers to many questions, but they normally pertain to other people than ourselves. Most of the questions that I would like to explore pertain to understanding myself. I am generally a happy person, and although I know that I will go through tremendous changes during my college career, I feel that I have a pretty good grip on the person I am. But--even though I feel this way, sometimes I have uncontrollable and unexplainable emotions. When this happens, all I can think is "why?"  Psychology is one of those things that I  don't know much about, but even with the little knowledge I have, I am amazed. I think it is very possible I may want to have a career in this area. I don't  really know how I got on this spill about your class; probably because it drives me crazy not knowing what I want to do. I've always had everything very planned out, but after really thinking about it, that isn't the way I want to plan the rest of my life (if that makes any sense). What I mean is. I can't just pick a job (say Pharmacist), and decide "I’m gonna be a pharmacist. "  That is what I  did about a year and a half ago. I even got a job as a pharmacy tech at ORGNAME’s which could help me out a lot. But, now I feel like pharmacy would get very dull  and boring. I feel like I'm on an endless search for something that really sparks my interest. I've never been really exceptional at one thing or in one subject, and that makes me feel kind of lost, like I don't have a calling. Psychology sparks my interest more than anything else, but I haven't been through the  course so I can't really say if I have a "passion" for it or anything.   Along with my search for a "passion," I want success more than anything. I have had an average life I guess, but my life would never be complete with out stress. Not stress in general, but financial stress. I know that I am much more fortunate than many others, so why am I so stressed. I guess because all of  my best friends were spoiled rotten, and I began to forget that I was so fortunate. I wasn't able to do all the things they were able to, I didn't get to drive a  nice car, go shopping , or out to ear. These are all things that I believe are superficial, but I would like to be able to do these things with no worries  when I am older. Even more so, I would like to spoil my kids rotten when that time comes around. Anyway (I’m a little scatterbrained today), I am a little afraid that when I find my so called passion that it will be something that will not allow me to accomplish my second goal. 
__label__label1 This assignment was not as hard to figure out as I thought it was going to be. Actually it was quite easy. All I had to do was follow the simple directions. It is pretty cool in here. This library is not quiet though. I thought libraries are for people trying to read or study, but this one has lots of little rug rats talking and laughing. Oh well. Next weekend is going to be a lot of fun. I get to go see my boyfriend, who lives in LOCNAME. I can't wait. Boy, I miss him a lot. I wonder how much my phone bill is going to be from calling him almost everyday. These two guys sitting by me are talking about weird things. I don't think they can figure out their computer. What do I want to buy today, when I go shopping?  I'm not quite sure. Maybe I will get a new dress. I really need to start looking for a homecoming dress. I have to have it by October because that is when ORGNAME ORGNAME's homecoming is. Hopefully my parents will pay for it. How do I tell them though, that on the way to LOCNAME LOCNAME I got a speeding ticket. I guess I will just tell them that I was so anxious to see them that my anxiety caused me to speed. The police officer was not very understanding though, although I was at fault and I am going to pay the consequences. I need to study all day today, but I’m not really looking forward to it. If I get behind in my school work though, it will be extremely hard to catch back up, and I don't want to have to do that. Maybe I will go out tonight and have a really fun time dancing and stuff. That ought to compensate for me studying all day, and release the stress. At least I will have something to look forward to tonight. For now I only have studying to look forward to. Who do I want to go out with?  Maybe I will call up PROPNAME. She's pretty fun to hang out with, or maybe I will go to a club with my brother and his friends along with mine. No, I did that last night. It was fun though, maybe I should do that again tonight. Whatever the case, I need to have a night of fun planned so that tomorrow I can study all day again. I wonder what my roommates are doing. I bet they are watching TV  That's all they ever do. It must get boring for them, but evidently they like it. I can't do that, because I get overly-bored. They are the type of people that don't like to do anything outside of the house. I can't believe I got messed up with them. If I only knew that they were like that, I would have never agreed to live with them. They are kind of psycho. I don't know how anyone can fight and be unhappy as much as they are. I try to stay away from there, but maybe I need to find new places to go. My brother is probably half way to LOCNAME right now. I hope he is doing well. At least I got to see him before he left. That girl has a tattoo on her ankle in the shape of a snake. That is so ugly. I would never get a tattoo like that. I think it is so unattractive to guys. That lies right above the piercing on the face. I don't really think too bad of piercing your belly button, but anything else is too far. Actually, I have even thought about getting mine pierced, but I’m not quite sure if I want to go through all of that pain. Wow, that lady has a huge afro. Doesn't she know that it looks really bad. I guess if she thinks it looks good though, then that is all that matters.     
__label__label0 I just met you. How can this feeling be?  It is a happy feeling. Its just awkward. I haven't felt it in awhile, at least since another soul and I grew apart. Things just faded. Two different people, two different lives. But now the emotion lurks once more in my heart. I try to fight it, but I can't. Something tells me to follow my heart, submit, and give in to the strong, enticing feeling that is just starting a war inside me. Thoughts just continuously rumble through my head; they won't stop. There's no control. I can't change how I feel. This is a crazy world. Everything just seems upside down. There is too much to think about in life. Who ever said it would be this complicated?  I wish there were just a secret to life and somebody would fill me in. I could just do anything I wanted to do. Pleasure could be my sole guide down every path in this extensive journey. The thought of consequences would never even enter my mind. I could live life day by day, and my only obligation would be to live. I would just enjoy life and breathe it in. Too many people today miss out on the beauty of their surroundings, the people they come in contact with and their environment. If a person merely goes through life only seeking material success, where is the true worth in that life?  That person would miss out on everything with true meaning and depth. Therefore, he or she is not really living but merely becoming a trained robot to fit into the machine of our material world. Things are so weird now. It seems that people have lost site of their morals and are only living to climb the corporate ladder. What kind of life is that?  Oh well, everybody is different. What is important to me may not be important to others. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME yesterday, and it was breath taking. I watched the sun set and the stars and moon come out. There was a gentle breeze that would pass over my face and lips and blow through my hair. At that moment, all stress seemed to disappear. It was complete tranquility and bliss. It made me want to just sit up on the mountain, take in the view, let my thoughts run free, and just live. 
__label__label0 As I write this paper I am still filled with the stress, but know gets much worse. I have been hired for a job, and I am still pondering if it is possible to handle both a job and school. I guess you can call it greed about money, but I need it to stay here. I am also thinking that this to easy. College is supposed to be hard, and yet my hardest class is my Microeconomics. With all this stress I still have the one thought in my head. What if I was not born?  Would it be less stressful?  This is not a suicide letter, but the thought of me not being born always enters my mind. Is life nothing but work and school, or is it much more. I do not know I guess I am always thinking about the negative aspects of life. The world is not like peaches and cream. Tonight is a busy night. I have to do my laundry, and do some reading. I guess I am psyching myself out. And yet I am alone in a city that is surrounded by my burden. I do not know what the point of writing this. I guess I need the grade, but even then I wish why I can not be truly happy about my life. To think that some where around the world somebody is happy, and it makes me sick to think about that. Life is not fun and games it is a weary journey that must be gone through, but I can't rest my feet until I am done and gone. 
__label__label0   Ouch, that hurts. Damn, damn, damn. I really don't care much for playing PROPNAME PROPNAME as a homework assignment. My understanding is that I get to talk about anything I feel like. Well, today I feel like talking about the absence of love. I've never, and I never will. I know this because I know myself; I've been acquainted with myself for the past 00 years. But, you know what?  Love doesn't come easily to someone who's never been given the chance to cry over another. And disappointment rides high among those who look toward the intangible as an archetype. And perhaps, love may not be recognized by one who stages the downfalls and disappointments by crowning the archetype. And what becomes of these kings?  They assure an even greater upset. My hell!  Who knew they'd turn out to be. human-of all things?  They've been raised by nourishing mothers who want to keep the cycle from breaking down. It's a revenge thing. What's revenge if our elders can't play?  And don't think the players of the game don't know. They all do. In fact, they're the unpolished beads hung through a thin thread patiently awaiting the cut that shatters all they hold. The dirty bastards don't mean it on the surface, but somewhere inside, not too deep, they feed off of this perverse pleasure. These prowling demons inside sense it. They know it and follow it by every word that falls from your mouth. They know it by every action pouring out of your senseless heart. But, wait, hold on. There is a simple solution to this problem. Find that beating cacophony that wakes you in the midst of terror, and do the smart thing all women should have accomplished by the age of 00. Rip it out, spit on it, and flush it down that damn toilet. Praise God for victory!  No more heartbreaks, no more suicidal tendencies (so I've heard), no more anything. Anything. Anything. I guess, I wouldn't know. Coming from one who's never been within a foot of love, it may seem an improper thing to do. But for those who have ridden on this vanishing wave, I'm sure the former action seems more than appropriate. However, and oh, I apologize so profusely for changing the tone so quickly-it loses audience, but I do have other things to do. um, however, if this route of throwing the heart is chosen, don't forget to wave goodbye to the emotions which allow one to cry, laugh, or even, yes, of all things-the sole feeling which gives you a natural high for days, the sole feeling that allows you to run around the world three times blindfolded on one leg without any replenishing substances-the feeling of love. Go ahead. Hypocrite would be a swell characteristic for this girl. But, must I ask, what is it that consumes two people who are in love?  The look in their eyes, the energy radiating through their bodies?  What is it that makes them. beautiful?  All of the time. I've never felt a consistent beautiful for longer than two days. consecutively. My dear, patient friend, that's exactly how I know it must be this emotion that I've never felt. It must be love. That emotion not specifically defined by anyone. 
__label__label0 My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME. I really don't know what I'm supposed to write but I guess I'll start anyway while I have some free time. I don't know if we're supposed to word wrap this thing or not so forgive me for the  excessive going out of the lines. I just barely made it here to the Ugl and decided  "why not and just do my homework while I have time. "  Today in Psych class it was  pretty boring. I just wish we did something a little more interesting. I took this class because an old girlfriend/friend recommended taking this class. She  told about her Psych class and how interesting it was. So far I like the class  but I wish we could start on some interesting facts. I still haven't bought my  Psych book and I hope I can hang on for one more day. I'm really just worried  about whether my financial aid is coming in. I also miss home already. I decided  not to go home over the holidays so I could stay here and hang out with my friends. But I think I made the wrong decision. Even though I came during the summer I still miss  home. For that whole month in the summer of 00 I just thought about going home. I was in the preview program for the summer but I don't regret being in that program. I met some of the coolest people during the summer than I have my whole  entire life. My old friends seem like dumb asses when compared to the ones I met. I just wish I didn't feel so insecure About Math. I hate Math. I used to be good in it when I was in Jr. High and the beginnings of my high school life. But during my Jr. and Sr. year I really slacked off and got my first C's from my  Pre-cal class and my Calculus class. That's one of the reasons I came during the  summer so I could take Pre-cal. That was one of the worst Classes I have ever taken. I got my first D in the summer and my dad wasn't to happy. He graduated from ORGNAME  and he wants me to do the same. I'll try not to disappoint him but I don't know  what the future holds for me. I just wish I wasn't in a major that required taking a  math class. But I hope I get an A average this fall. I better. I just need to work more smarter and know and learn how to study better. Plus I have a work study job now and I hope that doesn't drag me down. I guess It's almost been twenty minutes but  I still got about three more minutes to go . It's weird but I didn't think I could type for a solid twenty minutes without stopping for  a five minute rest or something. One ting I know right now is that I am starving. That damn job is costing me my  lunch. I think I have to start packing a lunch every time I go to work. I need to  buy meal replacement bars when I get my first paycheck. I just hope it's more than a hundred dollars. I forgot but I need to call my dad and ask about the financial aid. I guess I'll call him tonight and maybe he could sort out things. I feel so tired. I just want to go back home and sleep for ever. But I know that wouldn't be the wise thing to do. College sucks. I just wish things came a lot more easier to me. I have no more thoughts. I am just stuck here typing on a computer. Well I better  go eat now and hope that I typed enough for this assignment. One down and one to go. I guess I'll see you in class. Bye. 
__label__label1 Every time I get one of these writing assignments my mind always seems to go blank. They tell me "write about what is in your mind". It shouldn't be that hard I mean I am always thinking of something. For example right now I'm thinking I shouldn't have missed breakfast. Anyway this is sort of like writing a letter to a friend where you don't have to worry about grammar and things like that. At least I hope not. I feel like the twenty minutes are never going to be over. Actually I am amazed at how fast I am typing, and I've never taking typing course in my life. Well I think I'm typing fast. I don't know how many words a minute I can type. I hope I do well in school. This place is huge. I am enjoying myself. I've never been on my own before. You can call it a learning experience. There is not much to here with out a car. I hope I get credit for this. I wonder if this one of those things were they try to get into the mind of LOCNAME's youth. They probably didn't get much out of me, since I don't seem to be thinking anything interesting. Maybe I don't know to type all that well. Some people just sit down and all you here are them hitting the keys. I wish I was like that, I could finish my assignments quicker. I need to take a typing course. I also need toenail clippers. You guys probably don't want to here that, but you asked to write down what I was thinking. I also need a poncho because it looks like it's going to rain. No chance in you guys getting me one? Well the twenty minutes are up. c-ya     
__label__label1 ORGNAME I was just thinking about the rolls  from Kinsolving. My friends are in my room just got really quiet so I felt very conscious of there presence. I don't know what I'm thinking about!!  I am now looking at my nails-- I've been biting my nails so there not very long anymore. I'm wondering how long 00 minutes is going to be for this assignments. I really miss my friend PROPNAME, my best friend. She would be able to make friends so easily here at LOCNAME. I am worried because I need to make study buddies. I hope my classes won't be too hard. the back of my desk is old-- well, not the back of my desk the drawer is cold   I'm so blank   I guess  when I have to write down my thoughts, it's harder   My typing sucks-- I type okay but I make a lot of mistakes that keep me from typing all of my thoughts.

I've already written for about 00 minutes-- that went by pretty fast  should I go the Grease thing? I don't want tulle on my window-- is that the way you spell tulle?  PROPNAME just told me it is spelled tulle. How am I suppose to know how to spell tulle  I wish someone was in love with me-  I wish I could find someone to love. Most of the guys around here seem to ignore my presence I remember this episode of Friends  The guy is so rude  I love Friends  it is so funny  Wow, it's practically been 00 minutes-- my wrist hurts from typing so much  That girl is so funny-- I can't wait until the new episodes come out-- if I have time!!  That settles it-- it's been over 00 minutes. So I guess I'll you go  
__label__label0 The first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. My gawd!  Now I am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. Oh, I guess I will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. Now my roommate PROPNAME is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. Maybe if I ignore him for long enough, he will go away. My glance has caught the sight of the Daily Texan. What a lousy newspaper. It is really short, and the best-written articles are from the ORGNAME ORGNAME. That's really pitiful, because the ORGNAME ORGNAME writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. But that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. I see that they (ah, the non-descript "they") have created a virus that destroys the AIDS virus in at least some instances. Supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. That brings up the issue of testing on animals. I have mixed feelings about the issue. If only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. And if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. But that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. I saw a Twenty-Twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. They were so intelligent, and so smart. They were depressed, and so sad. Poor babies. Why do I call them babies?  Because that implies that they are poor and innocent. I hate the "dart" board in our dorm room. It is not a true dart board, but one of those Velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. "Bulls-eye!  Oh, dang it, it fell off. Never mind. "  That is quite typical. I hate studying!  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I hate to puke!  Just kidding. It's just that I have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now I am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. Needless to say, I could use some improvement in my study habits. And the astronomy is so dry!  What up with that, G-dawg in da' house?  You ask any G-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what I'm sayin', fool?  School tomorrow!  I don't even want to think about it, so I won't. Church went well today. I played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 0:00 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. Oops!  Thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. No, actually, I usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. I must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. Especially since I had to hear three sermons. Two is my limit, and three is just too much. Now I am singing in my head. I cannot stopping "playing" in my head the new version of "Candle in the Wind" that PROPNAME PROPNAME wrote for Princess Di's funeral. "It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. "  I believe it has been twenty minutes, so I'm OUTTA HERE! 
__label__label0 I'm sitting here typing again I’ve got a lot to do today I want to get all of my work done soon so I don't have to worry about anything this weekend but I probably will anyway cause I always do. I wish I was a speed reader like on this movie I once saw -my stepmother’s an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if I could do that I would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . I’m sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe I should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that I have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now I feel it may have been a mistake I’ll feel better tomorrow. after I sleep it will be nice to see PROPNAME tomorrow. PROPNAME is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- I wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- I wont be one of them though I will stand alone. Mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but I think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so I cant see his 'cycle' but still I think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when I was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we aren’t really all alone were all created from the same stuff. I probably sound like a televangelist but I shouldn’t care what you think of me anyway. I wish I could just cuddle up with PROPNAME under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep I love waking up next to him so warm - it doesn’t even matter if we get married - I've thought about it sometimes. its what's now that’s important and I love him and we’re happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now. 
__label__label1 Well I'm finally doing this writing assignment. It was not in my mind at all so I totally forgot about this stuff. This assignment is taking me back to the seventh grade because in my English class. damn I keep messing up on my typing. well back to what I was talkin about. We had to write at the beginning of every class for five or ten minutes about anything that came to our mind; of course if we didn’t wanna write a story or something. So what I would write a lot is something like "I think this writing assignment sucks, . its stupid. and I’m bored. I'm bored. ", on and on and on. I also just would like keeping writing the alphabet in random order. Well now I'm listening to this tired ass song from Puff Daddy, "Ill Be Missin You"  It talks about death of a friend. To me that is very scary. Cuz I always imagine how it would feel when you die or like where do you go. Its just a scary feelin that you don’t know when we might not be here anymore. I had a few people that I knew die. Its just a sad thought. Now I’m thinking about how college isn’t that bad. Only if it wasn’t for me being lost in Calculus. I mean I shouldn’t have any trouble; I was Valedictorian and I feel very stupid, upset, frustrated, and scared. Oh shit. I just flinched cuz I got startled by the fact that some guy across the hall here just slammed the door very, very hard. Two times and said "jack ass" so loud that I heard him while I’m sittin here typing in my dorm room. Well I need to start getting on the ball and do all my reading and homework, especially in Calculus. For some odd reason its just not clicking for me. and math is supposedly one of my best subjects. I guess that was in high school. and I even took calc. last year. Oh, now the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME song is playing. I think that that movie wasn't as good as it was in the previews. So now I don’t really have anything else to talk about. Actually I cant wait to talk about my college experience cuz boy do I have some problems right now. Oh damn there's a phone call and I got up to get it but I don’t know what happened. Well I’m going to be going home tomorrow so I’m not going to the UT vs. ORGNAME on Sat. I think I’m gonna go to the library in a few minutes after I finish writing on here. I’m actually finished so I guess I’m Out. PEACE. 
__label__label0 I cannot believe that I am actually writing and doing my assignment on a Saturday. I am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying ORGNAME talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and I got nowhere with my friend. I feel so bad for my friend, PROPNAME. He is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. I feel like I should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. I guess that I should talk about myself and not about other people, but I am just so worried about him. I have been so extremely busy today. I woke up at 0 this morning. And I had to go to a BASIC meeting, which I am very involved in. I just happened to be 0 minutes late, and now I have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next Friday. I guess I don't mind if I do it to learn not to be late anymore. Then I had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. I didn't want to go, but I felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. I am glad that I went because they are my family and they helped to support me when I needed them most. Actually, my friend PROPNAME, which I just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when I asked him to help me move b/c he had a truck. I asked way in advance, and I called him the night before, and I even told him that he could back  out and I wouldn't even mind. He actually said to my face I don't want to do it when I had driven all the way from ORGNAME to ORGNAME. I couldn't believe that he had said that! I was so mad! I mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. Then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. I got prideful, and I said that I would take care of it myself. Then I realized my pridefulness, and I prayed to God to break me down. He definitely showed me how I need to be more patient these days. I then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. Our mutual friend had before, but PROPNAME somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. I don't know. I then thought about and then prayed some more, and then I realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. I went to LOCNAME on vacation, and I had bought him a key chain b/c I knew how stressed he was. I put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. The fact was that if I wasn't living by myself, then I could have gotten more help. And if he said that he was too busy, I would have understood, but he  said that he could. Everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. But he is so depressed and distraught and etc. I wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. I know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. I just don't understand why he is acting this way. I also have a feeling that he likes this girl  who was an old roommate. Everyone knows. For some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. I hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. She doesn’t happen to know, and I don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. I just hope that everyone gets better. 
__label__label1 I returned to LOCNAME Monday night at about 00:00 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was PROPNAME and the source of her angst was my best friend PROPNAME. They, as I am, are both from LOCNAME. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for ORGNAME. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. PROPNAME declares she is "so totally over PROPNAME" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to PROPNAME, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in LOCNAME. She has a lot of frustration with PROPNAME, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. PROPNAME's feelings toward PROPNAME are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions PROPNAME is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be "friends", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto PROPNAME as a friend. PROPNAME's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 00 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both PROPNAME and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to Huge UT ORGNAME life challenging. Thank you. 
__label__label1 I am pretty up set that this is my second time on this assignment. the computer I did this on the first time disconnected the first time I did this exercise. I wish I had time to do it over yesterday but I had to study. studying is taking up alot of my time. more than I expected I would have to. I didn't know that college would be this tough. Oh' this is my favorite part of Scream. to bad that I have to keep writing. I really dig this assignment. I think it is pretty cool that the ten points is free. T he assignment isn't that  hard to do if you can find time. That is one thing that I wish I had more of. I wish that reading come a hell of alot easier than it does. I just wish that the first time would be enough. But for me it isn't. I wish that some times I was as smart as some people I know. the load of school is really beginning to weigh me down. I guess you guys will label that as stress. I always feel that I AM being constantly studied in psy. I always wonder what that would when I do a certain thing or think a certain thought. I really enjoy the class but I am way behind. I have a lot of reading to do in that class . I have alot of catching up to do. Especially in that class I am way behind on the chapters. I just want to have some time to do the things I want to do. I want to go an play basketball and lacrosse or just watch TV. I just want to relax and have fun . Studying sucks. It makes me sick and it never leaves my mind. Always know I should study but I don't. I am so lazy when it comes to doing the tings I have to. Man the moving is getting good but I don't want to tell my roommate to turn it off. I like it to o so I wouldn't to turn it off either. I sure do think this twenty minutes seems to be taking a long time. You think that it would go by quickly but not when you want to do something else. I am really excited about next week when I go to see PROPNAME and Emily in LOCNAME and LOCNAME. I hope I CAN get a better car so I can make it. I am also excited about the football game this week when we sit on the 00 in row 0. That's sweet. I think this is taking so long. you guy's should make this 00 or 00 minutes long next time. too bad we couldn't do that for the other two due in December. I am two shy to ask the Prof. in class, maybe after class or before. He'll probably laugh in my face when I suggest it. The last four minutes are taking too damn long I just want to finish and do something else. I want to watch the movie and not study. Studying blows. I wish things were a hell of alot easier. the clock is going to slow. I am sick of writing. this is taking too long to finish. I want to do something else than this poop. the writing is getting very boring. there is another good part of the movie coming up. the movie is pretty good and I have to do this crap. there it went the best part and I missed it because of this crap. It may seem harsh but that is what I am thinking right now and that is what you asked for. yeah I done with this. 
__label__label1 I am at my friends house right now because I don't have a computer to use at my home. I just decided to get this assignment over with. This room is really hot. There are four people in this house right now. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and me. My girlfriend, PROPNAME is asking everyone of us to quiz her on her vocabulary that she has to memorize by Friday. It is very noisy in here and PROPNAME is telling me to shut up. I really want to get drunk and have fun but I can't because I have school tomorrow. I need to stay focused on my school work and keep myself in control. I'm only a Freshmen and I'm really worried about UT because of the horror stories all my upperclassmen friends told me about. My father told me to concentrate on my studies because it is my responsibility to do excellent in school. He said that it is my life that I'm preparing for, not his. I'm also using my money because I'm using the loan that I received. I've been dating my girlfriend for two and half months and I think we're doing good. Everything is working just right. I cant wait till this weekend so I don’t have to worry about school for about two days. Actually, I have to do some reading and a short homework. I wonder if anyone sent me a E-mail. I better check it when my twenty minutes is up. I cant believe how much money I spent ever since I came to Austin. I spent so much on food, clothes, gas, and more food. Oh yeah, and mostly important, the books!  (Yeah right!) Oh man! I did so bad in Philosophy today. I read my homework but still got a zero because the quiz was a little tricky. This is kind of fun expressing my thoughts on the computer. Oh!  Twenty minutes are up!  Bye Bye!                                                                                  
__label__label0 I really want to go swimming but I don't want to tell PROPNAME that I don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. I really want to go home this weekend. I know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with PROPNAME even after I haven't seen her for a while. Maybe I just don't want to go out with him I think that I feel guilty for some strange reason and I can't get the courage to tell PROPNAME. This air conditioner is really bothering me. It makes so much noise and does not cool very much. I am so hungry. My roommate sucks. I don't know why I'm so mean. Maybe I'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything I do. Maybe she's just too smart and I feel stupid. I'm really hungry. I don't know how I'm going to get to eat if I go with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder if PROPNAME is calling me right at this moment. I wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. I think I'm  making too much noise typing. I get the feeling that I'm disturbing everyone behind me. I can't believe PROPNAME. She just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. I wonder if her parents know the way she is. I still have one more question to do for Economics and I don't really feel like reading. I learned that I should wait to be told what to read before I stress That stress test PROPNAME and I took was weird. I think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. I bet he thought I was weird. He could right away tell what was bothering PROPNAME. I know that PROPNAME really has PROPNAME thinking about him day and night. He's such a jerk. I can't believe what How could someone treat someone that way. Maybe love is blind. I wonder why people around here are so free. I can't believe that girl I say two days ago. She was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. I assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. I wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. I had to turn around for a second. I think that I'm a nosy person. I often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. During lunch today I listened to two complete conversations. I could not believe the things that people talk about. Why does my roommate have to be so selfish. I think that I want to make everyone healthy. I don't know why but I am so self conscience of the way I look. But I hear that is actually average in girls my age. I went all out on this diet until I lost up to 00 pounds and now I think that I am too skinny. but I say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do I gross myself out when I see my roommate eating horrible and then I see her change and I feel that I have to go workout. She gets offended very easily. I don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly. 
__label__label0 I still need to do my homework for Spanish. I'll be spending a lot of time in this building in the spring because I'll be back in design and vis comm. I'm getting hungry. tonight PROPNAME PROPNAME and I are going to get pizza. PROPNAME and I weren't getting along too well for a while. it was because I have been dating and spending less time with him. for a long time it was always just the two of us, neither one dating. now that I am it bothered him just a little bit. oh well, we talked about it and he's better now. which is good, I don't like to fight with Alex. I have a lot to do this week, tonight I need to read and I would like to work on and ,ideally, finish my calculus homework. tomorrow I am going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. I talked to one of the managers this weekend at the forum and he said that they were hiring. that would be a good place to work, at least I like the store. we'll see. I guess I need to call my sister tonight she always gets all worked up if I don't talk to her once a week. I just talked to her the other day though, sometimes I just don't feel like talking to her. I hope that someday she'll stop trying to mother me. I hope that now that she has a child she will let me be. I actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. this is my first time to take calculus so I didn't know what to expect. it is pretty interesting. I'm really getting hungry and it s going to be a couple of hours before I get to eat dinner I wish my computer at home worked it is so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. I 'm glad uncle mike is going to help me with it. mom really did a good job when she picked uncle mike to be my financial adviser ii really care for hm a lot. it is always  amazing to me that it is usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. you always are expected to help your family whether you like them or not but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things and they won't hold it over your head. unfortunately most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. I can't stand that sort of thing. 
__label__label0 I wonder if I am doing this right. I can't stop thinking about truyen. I need to stop. PROPNAME, she is like two hundred miles away and I can't get her out of my mind. I need money. I need something. maybe a drink. maybe I need a cigarette. I was trying to quit but I just can't seem to do it. its only been two minutes now and I have already run the course of my brain. I need to do my laundry. I want to swear, but I might offend whom ever is reading this . if anyone is reading this , what should I do???????? I 'm hungry. shoot I stopped. Oh well, I can get back into it. I really don't think I am doing this right. I wonder if heather will feed me? I really want a drink. I am stressed out and I just need to party. I'm not an alcoholic. I think my hypothalamus is screwed up. shit my bag is in my way, It's on fire AAAHHHHHHH I can't breathe. I keep pushing that damn backspace button. I am just not going to push it anymore no matter what mistakes I make. I wrote that entire sentence without a mistake. ironic huh. shit! I pushed it again. What in god's name am I doing here? I 'm talking about a backspace button and what 's really on my mind is the fact that I have no money and I am lonely. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this, but oh well. I don't care who reads this. You only know that I am a number. Maybe if you got to know me I would scare the living shit out of you. I am screwed in the brain. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA I have like fifteen more minutes and my arms are getting sore. I need to stop, but I can't' stop! I need to press on with my story of nonsensical blabbering. I want to go home. I need a job. I need a woman. I have a woman but she is in LOCNAME and I am in LOCNAME. Am I forcing myself to think this? Am I just doing this for the show. No I really am hungry. Who am I talking to anyway. That guy next to me thinks I am weird. WEIRD I can tell he thinks that I am just typing away on this little machine and not really saying anything. But am I? TEST I like to push the buttons, PROPNAME. I push them all at once and lock up the computer calm down now. I can't just blab on this thing all day l0ong. I need o go home. I need to go back to LOCNAME. I need a hamburger. I need a drink I need a  A in this class. I need a smoke. Me memmemememem why is it always about my needs what do you want? what do you need? these chairs are comfy. my I have a dirty shirt long arms weird hands. Am I just writing these things,. hoping that someone will read it and tell my what is wrong? Am I looking to be labeled? Am I crazy? Am I stupid? I'm not stupid. I know what's going on. I can see you guys are trying to make me paranoid, well it ain't going to work. Nobody makes me paranoid. That's my little joke, get it? I'm paranoid about being paranoid. It's funny. Laugh you friggin computer ! Is my time almost up yet In this land you can't stop until you have been programmed. Am I programmed yet? what the hell am I doing? I want to go get something to eat. I can't I have no $$$ I have a job interview tomorrow. I hope I get the job so that I can eat and buy gas to go home and tell PROPNAME how I feel about her. FUCK you your never going to tell her that. Someday I will. yeah right. No If I just go to her and say, hey I really like you and I want to marry you, she will run screaming and never want to see me again. I can't do that. But I can't just sit in my biology class with all these beautiful women and think about her all my life. I need to do something. The time has expired. 
__label__label0 The on e thing in my mind right now is obviously college. I didn't really have to study to get past high school, but I foresee a lot of changes in my schedule, just 00 min ago I did ALL my math homework for the first time in maybe a year. If studying was my chief concern than I would be perfectly satisfied. Unfortunately that is not my only concern. I am originally from LOCNAME, so as much as I hate to admit it I miss my home, and even my parents. there are so many things about home that I miss, thing that I nerve thought would matter, things like going to the bathroom. Well I miss the past, and I am worried sick about the future. How will I do in my first test?  How will I register for spring classes?  Will I have enough hours to graduate with a BS degree in biology?  Will I get into Medical school? If I don't get into Medical school, then what will I do?    Obviously time is the only thing that will answer these questions. but you can not help but worry about them. Ever since I was little I wanted to be a doctor. Well not from the beginning, I have wanted to be a doctor ever since I was 00. That is when I had a brain surgery. After that I wanted to use the life that was saved by another as a tool to save other people. There have been a lot of changes that have occurred in me but one thing that has stayed consistent within me is my passion to help others. The one thing that made me feel occurred when I was 0. My grandfather and I were walking down a street when we ran into a beggar. my grandfather had just bought me my favorite kind of ice cream. When my grandfather took the ice cream from me and gave it to the beggar. at that time I hated I'm for it. . but when I went to sleep that night all I could see was the gleam in the eyes of that beggar. it was at that time that tears starting coming out of my eyes. I felt proud that I had participated in something so beautiful. Being a doctor to me is the best to repay god, and my family, and those doctors that saved my life.  The one thing that I am afraid of is the one thing most people are afraid of. failure. Fear of failure has always driven me forward, it is my opinion that fear of failure is the one thing that keeps this world going. everybody has a goal in their life and the fear of failure makes them work as hard as possible. hopefully one day I will walk out of a doctor as a doctor, who just helped saved someone life. . that would be a dream come true. 
__label__label0 I don't have a clue of why I am feeling this way . I am thinking about many things as I type this paper. One thing is, I hope I have a good freshmen year in college. I was not worried about college until I got up here. Now that It has  started I'm nervous. I'm waiting for the day when I have test in every class, I don't know how I will handle it. I going to have so many things going on such as fraternity stuff. This is going to be gun but I hope I have some free time to study during pledge ship. If  I don't my life will be miserable and I will end up  at good ol cleburne LOCNAME. So far in LOCNAME I fill comfortable when I m around other people but get home sick when I m alone in my room doing nothing. I fill weird because when I was at home I could call my friends and girlfriend and we would go out and do something, now that I don't know a lot of people I can't do that. I fill that your class is going to lots of fun because you came across as a good professor. Tonight i am going out to have fun with my pledge brothers we only have 0 more days of freedom. I hope I  make it to christmas, if I do pledgeship will be done with and I can go on living a normal life. Right now I fill like eating something but I don't know what. Jester food does not go down right. I think that is why I am sick. My brother is  a senior this year and will graduate in December. I wish I was in his place. I'm ready to settle down and hopefully make a good living to support my family. I fill at this time that I want to do something in computers. That is where the money is. the thing is that I'm not ready for really hard classes and bundles  of homework. Well my 00 minutes is up so I'm going to submit my paper and grab a bite to eat. 
__label__label1 I am really confused right now because this girl that I think is so incredibly attractive and fun and nice and well you get the picture. Anywho. She says that she likes me it's just that she does not want a serious relationship. I totally understand that because the more that I think about it I don't want that either. I am not really sure what it is that I want. I know that I just want someone to be there for me. It would be nice to have someone who you always know will be there. Maybe I should just explain to her that I am not asking her for marriage. I am just asking for her to be there for me when I need her and I will always be there for her when she needs me. In high school I really was kind of a guy who moved around A LOT!!!!  I could never be satisfied with one person for an extend period of time. I mean hell I just got bored. But with her it is different. The first day we met we stayed up until 0am the next day just talking on my friends couch in his dorm room. Then we fell asleep together on the couch and when we got back up we just started talking again. I have only know her for a week but I feel like I have know her forever. I mean I found out so much about her in such a little time. I sometimes don't know that much about people whom I have know forever. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. Women are so darn confusing. Well maybe it is the situation that is actually confusing not her. Or maybe it could be me?!?!?!  Well guys aren't confusing. I mean we say what we mean and girls just read way to much into it. I guess I just want her to feel the same way about me that I feel about her. However, there is a lot going on this fall. I have just started college (and I think that may be the reason that she doesn't want a boyfriend) and I am thinking about joining either the Business Council, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, or the Iron Spikes (they are the baseball teams spirit organization). With all of this maybe I won't have time for her. And I would not want to be so into her then have her start liking me and I stop liking her. I would feel so bad if that happened. I just want a good girl who will treat me like I deserve to be treated and like me for who I am. I guess I should just give it some time. Things happen for reasons and who am I to think I can change someone. Well I guess if I really wanted to I could manipulate her into doing what I want. (I am too good at doing that. It kind of scares me)  But what the hell would that accomplish?  Nothing. Well nothing good can come of it atleast. Someone once said that we are who we are today because of the choices we made yesterday. So I am going to make a choice to just let things run their course. If it is meant to happen then it will. If not no big deal. ***side thought****** I am not the fastest typer and my fingers are starting to get stiff. ***side thought is over*****  I am not really sure what this writing assignment is going to accomplish, but I hope it helped you as much as it helped me. It actally gave me a chance to sit down for 00 minutes and actually reflect on something that has been bothering me for a few days. Wow this psychology stuff is pretty cool. I may just have to minor in this. I am starting to like it. :) :) :) :) :) :) :) 
__label__label1 I just came back home to LOCNAME from LOCNAME this morning. It was not a bad drive today. I am now at home relaxing for the remainder ORGNAME the day. I really kind of miss home but I guess I will get used to living on my own after a little while. I miss my parents and girlfriend. It is hard to leave the people you care about the most knowing you won't see them for a period of time. Hopefully though I will start to meet many new people here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I really like LOCNAME, now I just need to explore it. I know a few people up here and they have helped make it a lot easier to be here. I hope school is not too terribly hard. I know I must study and do all of my assignments and make sure I do not fall behind. I think reading and attending class are two of the most important elements of college. I am somewhat scared though at the fact that three tests comprise your semester grade. If you do bad on an exam, you will really have to work hard to pull yourself back up. I just don't know?  I need to get into the routine of college before I can give a valid evaluation of what college really is to me. I hope I do well. Enough with school. I am so excited to be living on my own. I have new responsibilities as well as many new freedoms. There is nobody here to tell me when to come home or what to do. I am the superior. With this new freedom though I know I must watch and take care of myself. No one is here to pick up after me and no one is here to watch over me which is kind of frightening. It creates a sense of happiness, but at the same time a sense of fear also. 
__label__label0 I'm not sure since I've just started College and haven't had any tests yet. I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 00 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. 
__label__label0 I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at LOCNAME. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in LOCNAME, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph. 
__label__label0 I know there's nothing "wrong" I can write, but I still feel like whatever I'm writing may not be what they had in mind. It's about 00:00, and I am starving. As soon as I finish this I'll get to go and eat. I just came back from calculus, which is at least a 00 minute walk away from where I am (which is Dobie). I don't think I'm going to learn too much from the professor I have for calculus. He doesn't ever explain what the hell he's trying to do, and, like today when this guy tried to ask him, he almost yelled at him for jumping ahead. It is really frustrating because he first says something and then writes it down verbatim, and it makes me really mad. He wastes so much class time writing down the obvious even after he's said it ten times. I tried taking notes, but I doubt they'll help. I have always loved math, but this is just frustrating. My friend PROPNAME (who also lives here nad is from my tiny hometown) has a suitemate named PROPNAME, who had him last year. She said it's horrible. SLhe only knew two people who got an A in his class. She was telling me about how he writes down every little thing, and now I see what she means. She also said his tests are nothing like the homework, so I don't know what to expect. I am so hungry right now. I didn't eat too much this morning, because I never seeem to be hungry when I first wake up. My roommate is really sick. Ithink she has strep throat. Which means it'll only be a matter of daysbefore I get it too. My immune system has never been that good. I know, I know, I never really exercised that much, but I never seem tok have too much energy. My mom always thought I was anemic, but tests show I'm supposedly not. It's so weird how whenever I walk around campus I keep seeing people I know. Well, not really know, but I recognize them from camptexas or orientation or somewhere like that. I usually don't get to know too many people from placeslike that because I tend to be a little on the shy side. People always toldm e I'd outgrow that, but, well, I'm still waiting. In fact if there's onet hing I could change about me, ti'd probably be that. Everyone says you can make yourself  not be shy, but I'm sorry, I don't know how. I've tried and tried, but to no avail. When I'm around a lot of people I know, it's not too bad. Like in high school, I knew everyone in school (it's a small school and we've allb een together since kindergarten) and it was never too bad. I didn't love public speaking or anything where a lot of attention was directly on me, but I was always pretty comfortbale around everyone. But here I feel kind of lonely. My cousin, ORGNAME, who is a sophomore here, says it was that way for him lst year. I can't even reach one of my older friends here. I don't know what the problem is. And my other friend I called never called back. I don't know if she just didn't get the message, or if she's not calling back because she doesn't want to. My friend PROPNAME and I spend a lot of time together (we eat together and stuff) but she's already separating form me a little bit. At least we're going to the football game together. I'm looking forward to the game. I miss football. I never eallly appreciated it until I played powder puff last year. I somehow always feel like I'm overlooked because I'm quiet. At lest I hope it's because I'm quiet, and not just because I'm easy to overlook. I'm the youngest in my family, and whenever my older brother would be talking to my mom, she would always listen to him and ignore me, no matter what I was saying, until he left the room. Honestly, they thought because I am younger that whatever I say can't possible be as important as what he's saying. I could be telling her the house is one fire while he was telling her how he drove to town, and she wouldn't listen. Don't get me wrong, she has always been a great mom, but that has always bothered me, maybe more than it shoyuld. I don't really believe in those horoscope things, but sometimes when I have read them (at the end of theday) some eerie things ahave been true. Anyway, I read one of them on the ocmptuer. First of all, I have never been a "typical" sagittarius, like the magazines and articles say. They say they're all outgoing, and at times I am painfully shy nad introverted. Well, the one I read on the computer said the way to most hurt my feelings was to ignore me. And, that's true. If one of my friends is a total asshole to me, I will usual forgive them if they will just pay some attentin to me. I don't' think I have too many people in my life that I can count on, and that's really what I need most. I don't know if there's anyway I can fix that, but it's been a long 00 years. This probalby sounds like I'm a manic depressive, but before you call the authorities, let me assure you I'm not. I just don't have very high self esteem at times, and I often feel like I'm all alone in the world. I ahve a fear that I'll never find anyone to love me (like a husband). I don't see how someof  these other people manage to meet tons of guys, while I'm always alone. And most of those girls don't even appreciate them, and I know I would. Maybe it's back to the shyness thing. I really don't know, but I wish whoever did wuold tell me. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I was hoping my classes this smester would help, but I don't know. Part of me wants to go into business, but by the time I get accepted into the business school, I may change my mind again. I'm in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now, but who knows howl ong that will last?  I'm not lazy, but it takes me a hwile to get readjusted into going back to school. And even though I was in two ap classes my senior year and I graduated valedictorian by a long shot, I never had to work TOO hard in school. This stuff just came naturally to me. 
__label__label0 I 'm doing this because for the first time all night my modem got out og dobve without the number being busy. I spent the whole night doing homework as well as most of the day. I'm really hungry right now which sucks because no pllace is open right now. I'm really happy I got bakc with my girlfriend last night. I went thrugh what I'd call semi depression during our breakup. I lost 00 lbs in 0 weeks and would eat maybe one snack cake per day. I was really forlorn. I cut all my facial hair, which took me 0 weeks to grow. I got  a short note from her last week saying she wanted to get bcak to gether. I called her talked and on Sunday night we went to PROPNAME. / It was one of the best concerts I've seen I n a long time. I think I might buy that CD. PROPNAME I'm starving. I  wish I could get a bite to eat. I have to be up a 0:00 tomorrow f or class, That really sucks that I havce to gfet up every morning at 0 while my roommate sleeps till noon. Its not faiR! I think I'jll call PROPNAME ukp tomorrow. I haven't talked to her since Sunday. I miss her. It's pretyy cold in my room right now. Last night it was freeszing. My roommate brought over  his friend and wastched Pollitically INcorrect while I was trying to study how rude. She was disgustingly overweight. She desperatley needs to go on a diet. I saw this really fat guy at the concert last night. Weighted at least 000lbs. I hope he didn't take off his shirt during the middle fo the show otherwise that'd be gross. I'm getting sick of  listening to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I 'm gettting really tired. Maybe I should skip my early class tomorrow. I was fine this mornign and around 0 I started becoming really drowsy. I don't understand how I can always be tired at 0-0 but then take 0 hours before I fall asleep. Well I'm going to bed. 
__label__label1 I know so many people already, but I don't feel as that I have made that many close friends. I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to join a fraternity, and ultimatley decided not to, and now I wonder if this was the right idea. I tried to think of both all the positive advantages and negative disadvantages of joining a frat, and came to the conclusion that it would be too time consuming. But now I see a lot of my peers invloved with Greek organizations, and they seem to be having a lot of fun. All of my room/suitemates are in frats, so they talk about it and go to their activites all the time. I do not know if I made the right decision, but there is nothing I can do now because the pledge period has already started. I will have to make the best of my situation, but I am confident and hoping that it will work out. I have some very close friends fromm my hometown of LOCNAME LOCNAME who are not in fraternities, so I plan on hanging out with them a lot this semseter. To find worthwhile activites, I plan on joining some student organizations and Jewish groups. I am excited about all the people here at LOCNAME, and sometimes feel intimdated about everything that is going on (especially since at my dorm, ORGNAME ORGNAME, a majority of the residents go Greek and they are always doing something). I am an optomistic person though, and I will do anythign and everything I can to have a successful and enjoyable year in school and in LOCNAME. I am worried about a growing threat of religious fundamentalism in the world, and not only in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. This month, an Islamic ultranationalist group bombed two LOCNAME LOCNAME embassies in LOCNAME. This same group has vowed to destroy the State of LOCNAME, which is very scary to me and for all Jewish people throughout the world. PROPNAME PROPNAME, leader of the terrorist group, supports and financially funds ORGNAME, a Palestinian terror organization and ORGNAME, a Lebanese terrorist group as well, and has the support of many Muslims in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. He is very popular, and will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal- the immeidate "Liberation of Palestine from Zionist aggression" as he calls it, or "total annihilation and massacrre of the free people in the secular, democratic, peace-loving State of LOCNAME" as I see it. He sees LOCNAME as a hostile nation which should be removed from the world map. As all intelligent people know, LOCNAME is a peace seeking country that respects the rights and liberites of all its inhabitants, regardless of religion. PROPNAME has growing support of his movement from his radical fundamentalist supporters, and they are the ones responsible for commiting these terrorist acts throughout the world. For instance, this week he was probably behind a nail bomb which expoded in LOCNAME LOCNAME, injuring and killing many. Also, Pakistani radicals this week announced plans to overthrow the secular government and instill a new parliament based on Islamic religious law. In poor LOCNAME LOCNAME countries, where starvation and poverty are extremely high, people having nothing positive to look forward to, so they turn to fundamentalsim. The same movement is happening right here in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Some religious fundamentalist leaders, like PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME, are calling for mandatory school prayer and the inclusion of religion into public instituition. It is their intention to make the LOCNAME LOCNAME a Christian nation by passing legislation in favor of the religious right, which happens to be WRONG. The founders of our country included a seperation of church and state clause into the Constitution for a purpose, and that was to keep LOCNAME a secular nation. The radical right wing is trying to change this very core of our country. Learning fundamentals might be good in athletics, but preaching religious fundamenalism is a dangerous threat to all of society. I commend freedom seeking nations like the LOCNAME LOCNAME and LOCNAME for doing their part to combat this worldwide problem, which if not stopped will affect everyone in a very horrific manner. 
__label__label0 In the summer I had a surgery on my shoulder and currently I am in therapy. The pain I am experiencing right now is pretty bad. I am an athlete and I am used to bear with pain. But all the pain I have had before was relatively voluntary. I am also very anxious to get to my normal daily training. My body is screaming for training. But my body is not a problem, my problem is my soul and mind. I really miss diving and I want to come back and kick everybody's ass. I am also anxious to start studying. I am looking forward into this semester and I like my classes. I feel very excited about school and want to get great grades this year. That's all that I think about at the moment. I am home sick and I want to go home. I can go home for Christmas but I want to go right now. I want to be with my family. I have not seen my family for over a year and I really miss them. I want to be with my friends and see them every day. They are all at home in LOCNAME and I can not wait to see them again. Some of them had babies recently and I want to see them as well. I have known my friends for 00 years and we are very close to each other. I hope I will see them soon.     
__label__label0 I just don't feel like I have quite gotten into the groove of school yet. I hate that we start before labor day, because I feel like I am just getting my schedule back to normal when I get another vacation. I think I'm going home to see my mom this weekend, my birthday is tomorrow and hers is on Monday so were going to have a girls weekend, shopping, makeovers, haircuts, I can't wait. I wish that PROPNAME was coming with me though, I hate to travel by myself, especially flying, I'm glad the flight only takes an hour but I really do not like to fly. I can't imagine going to LOCNAME and being on a plane for an entire day, I would want to jump out, it just makes me feel trapped at least when your in the car you can stop along the way for a travel break. anyway, besides getting ready for this weekend, I have a lot of homework I need to finish, so I can have fun while I'm home, my horoscope told me today was a good housecleaning day, I've been needing to do that ever since PROPNAME's party, so I better do it today, or ill have to wait till the next full moon, or favorable planetary alignment!:)  I don't really believe in horoscopes, but I still read them, especially around my birthday, silly superstition I guess, my horoscope for this week said I should do something memorable and kind of crazy for my birthday. I'm thinking that's not such a bad idea. I've only got a couple more years left that its still socially acceptable for me to be irresponsible. what crap, I hope I'm doing pseudo-irresponsible (not life-threatening and stupid, just fun)  until I'm very, very old. its so weird that I would want to be like that, because I don't think I give off that image to the world. actually taking risks really scare me and I avoid them in real life as much as possible, but my rich a varied fantasy life is full of them. this should give you a clue to how type a I am, my fantasies about taking risks usually just include planning them, hardly ever actually doing them. where was I? oh yeah birthday, so I'm kind of bummed out bc I gave PROPNAME a really great party and bought him lots of presents bc at the time we had money, but surprise his stupid company hasn't paid him yet so right now a great birthday present for me would be to pay the bills. I'm feeling a little guilty about the way I spent money on him, when I sort of knew what the situation would be, but I can't do anything about it now, and I feel like its selfish of me to want him to reciprocate what I did for him. I guess that's my spoiled only child coming out. I really did have fun watching him opening his presents and enjoying his party, I didn't do those thing so he would do the same for me, but I would be nice! okay back to school I'm feeling okay about most of my classes even chemistry, but I do not want to fail calculus again! that would suck, I already dislike the prof's teaching style. I know he wants us to learn by understand the proofs, he thinks that doing tons of problems for practice, which is what I like, is a "high school" way to learn,  he actually really gets on my nerves. I really don't care about understanding calculus, I don't even have to take the second part, I just want to memorize formulas and pass the tests, too bad it doesn't seen to work like that in his class. I guess if I just keep up with it should be okay, that was my problem last semester, I just kept getting further and further behind, and tried to cram the night before the final. that works in my liberal arts classes, but in none of my science classes, which I guess in a strange way is why I like them. when I enjoying what I'm learning I don't mind reading everyday, and usually by the end of the semester I can really apply what I've learned in broader terms. it was really cool to see that a lot of the methodology and general theories I learned in my ecology classes were also used in psy. calculus is not one of those things I feel like I'm going to enjoy 
__label__label0 She kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  It kind of put things into perspective for me because I wouldn't know what I would do in her situation. well now that I am back in LOCNAME I try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that I necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people I am with right now are bothered because I am using their computer and I don't want them to see what I am typing, I usually feel this way with anything I do, I don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that I  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . I have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. I am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because I always hold back my thought and when I want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that I work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. I don't know how he made it here and have 0 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and I feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. But they tell me not to worry about so I tell them not to worry about me, I also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that I   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now I'm just tired of being a burden I know what I have to do and  I am going to do it. I have done this type of assignment before, I once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 00 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when I said that I was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when I  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 I am very attached to her and am having trouble dealing with her not being with me 00/0. We have dated for almost a year and a half and I don't want to date other people, yet I need someone that is physically with me that I can become close to. I call her all the time and it seemed that nothing has changed in our relationship after being with each other this weekend, yet at the same time as much as I want to see her as much as possible, I have so much trouble saying goodbye to her and letting her go that I sometimes think that it is not worth even seeing her. I knew long distance relationships would be hard, but I didn't realize how tough it would be mentally as opposed to physically grueling. We both don't want to date, yet we will have to get used to the fact of not being able to see each other but 0 or 0 times a month for the next 0 years. I am confused and I was told in the first place not to get myself in this position of having a long distance relationship, but we started dating the summer before senior year and I didn't know it would last this long at the time. On one hand I wish I never met her so everything would be easier, but on the same token she is the person closest to me and besides being my girlfriend, she is my best friend. I know if it was meant to be, then it will work out, but for now I don't know what to do. 
__label__label1 For instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd ORGNAME students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. In addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because I live ORGNAMEf campus. I attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems I haven't established any new friendships yet. However,  I will continue my efforts throughout the semester. Furthermore, I have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework I have been assigned each evening. It is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. I have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles I encounter. I have dreamed of earning my degree at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME since I was a small child. As I grew into a young adult, I never let go of my aspiration to attend the ORGNAME. My unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. I will accomplish my goals and I will prove to myself and family I can do anything that I put my mind to. When I get discouraged, I refer to the scripture, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. "  I know I can succeed at the University of ORGNAME with my sincere desire and strong determination. 
__label__label1 homework in the midst of my pre-cal assignment because my pre-cal is too long and really rather boring. plu, I need to catch up because I didn't start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing a little each night, my mistake. I hope to finish this writting assignment, the pre-test, my pre-cal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow. it's a lot but it will catch me up. then tomorrow I can begin my new pre-cal assignment and I can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary I can catch up on more psy. and pre-cal thursday evening. I'm also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday. james is a very good friend of mine and whenever I need to talk or unload my thoughts, james is excellent. plus, I'll put in a good couple of hours at my intern. david is going to teach me how to use my dad's camera and stuff so that sunday I can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed. then, I'll have those pictures to play with and I plan on getting some of my negativesput on a cd disk so I can manipulate those pictures also. I have a very busy life going right now. I don't know how I cram it all in sometimes, but honestly, I like to have something to do at all times. I don't know why, I'm not very good at sitting still alone. only if I'm watching t. v. or something. I'll get my new job schedule on thurs. I just changed jobs because I was tired of working at the old one, that and I hadn't received a raise in a year. the sad thing is, I don't know if I'll be getting paid any more at this new place. as long as I don't take a pay cut I'll stay, I just need a new enviroment with new things to do. I'll be working at bath and body works, I think it'll be fun, because I like the things they sell there and I get to be the saleswomen. I enjoy selling things to people. my managers seem nice also. I might have to work at five in the morning a few times a year and I'm not looking forward to that at all. I've never done inventory before so I don't know what it involves, but I don't see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if we'd be more productive a little later, even seven sounds more reasonable. I'd rather not worry about that until I know for sure that I'll be going in that early. I wonder what you're gather from all of my ramblings? five more minutes to go. I don't know how this is suppose to go, whather I should just write waht's on my mind or as if I'm talking to you at the other end. I gues in the end they're both going to get you the same stream of con. types of thoughts, huh?  I hope I can log onto the pre-test when I'm done with this, I tried it first and the server wouldn't let me on, yours or mine I don't know, I don't like computers much any how. I guess this was as good a way as any to put off the rest of my pre-cal since I'm being productive in the mean time. I could have gone and watched tv, or read my book (not some school assignment. ) well now, that wasn't hard at all, I guess I'm good at rambling. my time's up.  
__label__label0 I am still adjusting to not being at home in LOCNAME. I still do call LOCNAME home and will for quite a will I am guessing. I am really glad to be at LOCNAME and aall but its a little scary. I know the classes will be very hard and that scares me a little. But so far, my classes have all been verry interesting. This summer I took a few classes at LOCNAME and I could barely stay awake. That is how much they interested me. Here it is different. I am not even the slightest bit bored during my classes. They definitely hold my interest. Philosphy and psychology are the most interesting to me. they overlap quite a bit. I cannot wait to go home this weekend. I miss my family, my animals, my friends, and my boyfriend soo much. I have used up four hours of calling cards already just keeping in touch. It was really hard form me to leave ecerybody back home. My parents are all alone now in a five bedroom house with no children to look after. Both my sister and I are in college already. She is a senior here at LOCNAME. I am really glad that we are going to the same school now because we never have before. But right now we are in a little tift. She came over to my dorm room the other day and waas really making me mad. She always says what I should do, what I need to do , what I should have done, and so on. We let our emotions get the best of us sometimes. I told her that she is not welcome back in my dorm room ever again. I really shouldn't have said that and I don't mean it. In fact, I really would like to see her again pretty soon. I called her yesterday ( it had been about three days since the fight) and we talked for about a total of fifteen seconds, but we did not fight at all, so I guess there's a little progress there. She only does what she does to look out for my best interest, so I should not take it so personally when she tells me that I am doing something wrong. I really don't want to miss the first football game this weekind on Saturday, but I guess I will so I can have a long weekend back at home. It will be worth it I think. There will be plenty more games to come in the future. I have to go to biology in 00 minutes. That class seems ok so far, but I know that I will struggle in there. I am really not a science person int that sense. I did alright in high school chemistry and all but that's a little different I'm sure. I hope I do alright in there. I know that computers are helpful and all, but they intimidate me a little. Everything is on the internet here. I am not used to being so dependant on computers. I do not even have a computer in my room, but hopefully I will get one soon. 
__label__label0 Here goes. Do you mind if I write a story. I'm a lot better a stories than I am about talking about my real life. The stories are more exciting, anyway. Did you note that I used a space in between a and lot?                             A Day For Something  Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago or something rather to that effect, (not affect), people lived in gray boxes. These boxes were called people boxes, because there were people inside them. But all of a sudden, people starting thinking that there might BE something outside of those tiny, cramped, dirty boxes they were inside of. So they came out and looked around. But they were wrong. There was just a lot more of the same around them.  Yea. Happy, nice, story. I think it means something about "Man's Glorious Ascension Through Time" or something to that effect. Here's another one. I'm pretty good at stories, but not much else. At least you'll have fun reading these, but if you don't, I'm still pretty sure the dumping sites aren't completely filled up yet.                          The Wonderful Talking Box of PROPNAME PROPNAME  Sorry. The title is wrong. But it sounds better than nothing, right? Here we go. This story isn't about much at all. It's about some crazy people who believed some retarded things and ended up being dictators of small, third world nations. -"We are sorry to inform you that the last paragraph was written by somebody who  has just been sacked. However, to continue the mindless assignment, it will be continued and stuff. "   Okay, okay, imagine this. A giant, 000 foot tall monster with 00 right arms, 00 left arms, 00 heads, and 00 legs is running about town and devouring people. This monster's name is PROPNAME PROPNAME.  Alright. Story. There was a time when everybody knew everybody else and everything was cool because everybody knew everybody and nobody knew anything. Got it?  Now some people learned things, others didn't, and others simply got to know everybody better. No. Wait. Oh, man, now I have to start over. I bet you're tired of reading gibberish like this.  "Hey, PROPNAME. "   "What?"   "I just said, 'Hey, PROPNAME. '  You weren't supposed to answer or anything. "   "Oh, okay. "   "Oh, uh, PROPNAME. "    "PROPNAME!"   "What?!"   "You were supposed to answer that time. "   "Was I?"   "Yep. It's in THE RULES. "   "What are 'THE RULES'?"   "It's just, you know, THE RULES. "   "Where did that spooky noise come from?"  rrAw, screw this. I'm out of time, anyway. (Grammatical errors in this piece of work: anyway      anyway ) fin Go home. Stop reading this. If you keep reading this, it won't tell you anything. 
__label__label0 I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like LOCNAME is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend PROPNAME. She is at ORGNAME but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with ORGNAME. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at ORGNAME but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in LOCNAME. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the ORGNAME, and LOCNAME is LOCNAME' little piece of LOCNAME. I am going back home to PROPNAME in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. 
__label__label1 Actually, I am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. Am I going to excel like I did in high school? or am I going to have an exceptional amount of stress that I will not be able to handle it. I don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. I just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. It's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. I just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. It's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. Sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. But what really attracts you to that person?  Is it the way they smile? The way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  After it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. Which, for some people, is the hardest part. It's the whole approaching the person thing. You want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. It's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. Finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  It's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. That's the neat part I think. but how do we know. I wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?  
__label__label1 However, after becoming sick I began to notice how much I was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines I needed. Now I have to do it all on my own. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, I had to pick up my medicine, I was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. Now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. I now have to wonder if I am doing things right, or if I am screwing things up. Also, I keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and I am not quite sure if I feel ready to see some of the people I graduated with. I am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but I am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. Then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. Everyone so going to make comments on the fact that I still don't have a boyfriend, or that I am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. All of this seems so superficial when I look at it, but this is the stuff that I have been thinking about. I have met several guys that I am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. I always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. I can pretend that I like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but I can't last more than two weeks with that person. I can try and try to make things work out but I always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. I just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. All through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and I was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture. I am unable to totally figure out what my problem is , but I am hoping now that I am in college I will "find myself. " 
__label__label1 I just met her parents and sister and they are very nice people I am glad to be  rooming with her I am not sure her religion but she is from san antonio  she is indian kyle is coming over here in a few minutes I hope he comes  soon we might go out to eat at a really good restaurant I want to but I'm n not sure if he does in a way I am upset with him but I don't know whether to  keep it to myself he was supposed to come over this afternoon and we  would spend all day together but oh well he was doing something earlier  with his friends dad just called and emily is going on a date I wish I  met the boy but emily likes him a lot it's weird to think that I was younger than emily when kyle and I started going out and we have been together ever since i love kyle ummmmmm I want to get icq on the internet to talk to aunt  debbie all the time I wish I could see kristin and melissa and brooke and  other friends that I miss a lot we are all going to homecoming though and we'll have some crazy stories I'm sure I hope kyle gets here soon should I change my clothes to go out or wear this I don't know hmm maybe I'll call kristine tomorrow and we'll do something together who knows maybe I'll call amy she is so nice and fun to be around oh and I have to see jennifer in psy class monday because at a party we found out that we were in the same class I thing that is really cool I want all of my classes to be interesting and not too hard man I'm kind of worried about all the classes and tests and exams and stuff but I am so excited about the football games that are starting in a week they will be so much fun to go to I'm sure more fun than high school football games but I don't know I'll probably miss being in the drill team and dancing at half time I wonder if PROPNAME is trying out for the dance team here or not she would definitely make it she is so awesome at dancing I hope she tries out and is really successful to show sarah g. that she can do anything that last year just wasn't for her in majesties I'm done it's been 00 minutes yeah!! 
__label__label0 This is the first time I have come to the library and when I first arrived here, I had no idea how to use the computers. First you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. Then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. I wonder what the point of this assignment is. I think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. How much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? People who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. Another feeling I have is that of being worried because I am doing this assignment at the last moment. After finishing it, I hope that I will get to class on time but I should because I still have a couple of hours before class starts. I am not sure what to write now. I have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so I am not going to write them down. I need to start getting to my morning class on time. I've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material I have learned before but I do still need a review so I have to start trying to get there on time. It's strange typing this assignment because all through high school I always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. It feels like I am writing an e-mail to someone because I never worry about any English stuff on those. The only thing I am doing different is that I am capitalizing some of the words which I normally don't do when I write e-mails. I want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so I can move on to the next assignment. These type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. I like this class so far. I have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. Two more minutes and that will be twenty. I can't wait to go back to LOCNAME to visit. I am partially homesick. There are certain things that I want to go back for and other things that I am glad that I left behind. 
__label__label0 college is perhaps the most unstructed, yet the most structured enviornment I have yet to face. Vague, vague, it's all vague, yet so remarkably specific. I can't help but thing about what I'm going to say next. I'm engaged in an activity, that's how I work. When I'm doing something, I try to do it with the most focus I can. To simply do it with no thought is, to me, a waste of mind. Back to college, I'm still trying to convince myself that I had no choice. Had I given myself the option, I would be a music major, but I didn't do what I had to do. I slacked off on my music, a thing I can never forgive myself for. Sure, in that time, I managed to develop my other skills in school, but what a becauset. I played viola for seven years to major in chemistry. Sure, some may say that just having played is enough, but for me, to not bring about one's work to full potential is not worth anything. I hope I go through with chemistry, then at least I can say I stuck with something. Listening to music right now, I think that perhaps I could have achieved that; maybe I still can, but it seems to far right now. at least the food is good, and my roommate is a nice person. I guess college will just be a test of how much I want to make a good life for myself. it's my brother; I'm so glad to talk to him; I had to leave him in the middle of the hardest part of his life (middle school); he was really used to having me there, but it seems like he's adapting fine. I hated my middle school years. The kids we mean and the teachers we less than happy to help out a shy little guy like I was. thankfully, high school was much better. College seems like it will be full of wonderful interaction, but I wonder how much interaction I'll be able to stand. I'm the kind of person who likes other people, but who also sees them as a distraction most of the time. and they always seem to distract when you don't want them to and disappear when you want company. I'll never figure people out. Well, this has been a lot of uncohesive thought, but I guess that's the whole point. adieu and farwell 
__label__label0 I really could care less that I'm doing it at this moment. However, I care about my grade in the class, so that is why I am typing. Lately I've really been curious about the UT environment and atmosphere. It seems to me that everything that an authoritative figure has to say is always an understatement of what is actually expected. For example, one of my professors indicated within a span of less than ten seconds that we should read over chapters one through four for the next session. When I got back to my dorm room I opened the book, thumbing through the chapters, and realized that this man expected the class to read a total of one-hundred and fifty pages in two nights!!  I don't consider myself lazy, but this seemed like quite an astronomical expectation for such a subtle suggestion. College life seems to be okay. I have a lot of free time, but when I really think about it, time flies so quickly that my free time is gone. I like my math class but can't stand the discussion lectures. I feel that they are a complete waste of time, until we actually cover material that I haven't seen. When this occurs, I'm really in for it because I'll be forced to attend the lectures. I really have a hard time understanding the TA, because he gets so excited about math that he talks too fast. People who get excited about math should do the world a favor and jump off a cliff. Just kidding, don't come searching for me because I said a morbid thing like that. My sense of humor is pretty violent. I like it when people have desensitized themselves enough to understand and enjoy that sense of humor that I possess. There is nothing that I can't stand more, however, is someone that totally does not understand my sense of humor and thinks that I am some sick individual. Typing for twenty minutes really sucks. I think I am getting carpal tunnel disease. I've never experienced so much pain in my wrists. I think I am going to slit them right now. with a dull razor blade. Then I'm going to cut my arms off and beat my roommate over and over with them. Once he has experienced maximum horror, I'm going to chop off his leg and leave him there to wither and die and horrible death. Then I'm going to go dive off a bridge onto I-00 and do triple somersault face-plant onto the oncoming traffic. Hopefully I'll traumatize someone in the car and cause them to go off the deep end. I'm just kidding. Would never do such a thing. Anyway, classes are going pretty good, I'm getting a real good taste, as a Freshman, of what college life is all about. I really enjoy having a mission or goal if you will, to get to class, and actually completing it on my own without parent supervision, or guidance, rather. In general, I enjoy the individualistic atmosphere here. However, I have become quite disturbed with the fact that no one talks to one another, perhaps because of pride, shyness, commitment to fulfill an independent lifestyle. Whatever it is, I'm troubled. I have repetitively made eye contact with numerous females on numerous occasions, but they don't look back. I smile but they don't respond. what a bunch of robots. I've never, ever, ever, ever had trouble communicating with the opposite sex before. New challenges await me. Oh well, time's up, hope you've had fun over-analyzing me. Oh wait, my name doesn't really matter, I'm just another statistic, or another number. Got to get used to it. 
__label__label1 College is awesome though, there is no doubt about that, but it is a little hard to handle well, but sick is an even bigger challenge. I never knew how fun college could actually be, it is crazy. There are so many new people to meet and make friends with, some are nice some not, but hey that is always how it goes. I grew up in LOCNAME so finding my way around campus is really no big deal for me. It actually is really nice, because I know my way around the entire city, and plus my parents are here just in case I really need them. Plus the fact that it is easier for me to get money that it is for most people. Another bonus about having grown up in LOCNAME is the fact that I don't have to change my doctor or anything like that, which came in very handy  this week, with me being sick and all. The one thing that bothers me the most about college is the pressure to fit in. I'm in a sorority and absolutely love it, but what I don't love is the fact that when we go to parties, every guy there tries to hand you a beer, and for someone who normally doesn't drink it can get kind ORGNAME annoying. But even worse is the fact that I start to feel like there is something wrong with me because I am not drinking. Like I should be and because I'm not that I am just the weird girl. It is hard for me because I don't want to compromise my moral and religious beliefs, but I continue to find it harder and harder to say no when someone asks me if I want something to drink. It is a very weird and torn feeling, and when I do drink I feel really guilty about it. The one thing that I don't understand is why people think that they need to drink in order to have a good time. After all, most of the time they don't even remember to good time that they had. I myself know that I am having just as much fun as everyone else when I am sober. I am continuing to struggle with this subject daily. I am out of the comfort zone of my high school friends. Friends who believed the same things that I did and that didn't feel like they had to drink to have a good time. I  miss them so much, even though I am making new friends here, I still wish that I could see my old friends every day, because just by looking at the expression on my face they can tell when I need a hug because I'm having a bad day or that I just need someone to talk to. It takes a while to form deep relationships with people because no one wants to open up right away and let themselves be vulnerable, they are afraid that if they do it will come back to haunt them, I'm guilty of the same things. It is just going to take time to make really good, deep friendships here at college, but I think that I am on my way. I often wonder if other people are feeling the exact same way that I am. If they are nervous, timid and scared. I guess that is really stupid to ask because I know that they are. I find it so strange how life takes turns that you never would have expected. It is never predictable and never quite goes the way that you have planned it to go. When I first applied for college I swore that I was going to go out of state, but low and behold I changed my mind and here I am  at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. God himself is just incredible, especially when he throws little things into your life, weather it is for the good or the bad you know that it is in his plan. If you ever really stop to think about what would have happened if you didn't meet one person, how many other of your friends would you have never met. I just don't understand how people can think that there is not a higher power looking over us, because from where is sit today, everything that has happened in my life, and the people that I have met, I know are more than mere coincidence, much much more.    
__label__label1 I tried to clam her down before talking to her about what was wrong. When I finally got a complete sentence out of her she told me that a girl who I was friends with, well we weren't like best friends or anything, but I had two classes with her and talked to her everyday, had been killed in a car accident earlier that day. I sat there for a second not even realizing what she was saying. When I got off the phone I went to my mom and told her very matter-of-factly what had happened. The next day I went to school not knowing what to expect, but after having been in class for only a short while and hearing my teachers and principal attempting to explain what happened and try and calm everyone down I was bawling. That's when it hit me, I just didn't understand it. Walking into the classrooms which I had shared with her only the day before was the weirdest feeling, I could see my other classmates in the hall and as they reached the classroom, some screamed, some wept and some just turned and walked away very quickly. The following days were exhausting, I don't think I had every cried that much in my life. I couldn't be at home alone, I don't know what I was afraid of, except just having time to think about it. Despite the hurting that I and the others that knew her felt, I was happy for her. She was in a better place, she was an awesome person and I have no doubt that she is in Heaven now. The funeral was huge it felt like our entire school was there. Her closest friends, including her boyfriend who was driving the car that day, all got up and told funny stories about her and how awesome she really was, that was comforting, but also extremely hard to listen to. At the intersection where she was killed people gathered at all hours of the day and night, it was a very saddening sight to see all of her friends just staring at the cross surrounded by flowers, her favorite candy and pictures, which still stands there. When I went to the cross all I could do was stare at the street and the markings which the police had made only a short time before. After the funeral I only went to her grave once and that was after attending my neighbors funeral, they were buried practically next to each other. It was all I could do to keep my attention on the service. When the time had finally come for my to walk over to her spot, I was fine until I faced it directly and saw her picture laying among the flowers and notes everyone had left. I lost it, I almost fell, but my sister caught me. I was a mess. I wrote her countless letters that never made it to the cross or to the site, but I know she knows how I feel and that comforts me. I pray for her family and close friends all the time, it was hard enough for me I can't imagine what it was like for them. 
__label__label0 Well, my mother has just gone back to LOCNAME ten minutes back, and frankly I am not all too sad about that, or not as yet atleast. All these days there were a lot of things I could not join in because I felt obliged to spend time with her and honestly I enjoyed myself. What made me most uncomfortable was the thought of what others would think. Would I be able to be a part of a group?    I have never really been one to mingle in a crowd. I suffer from what I call the " wall paper syndrome". I feel like the audience to a television program where everyone is settled in their roles. I might have just been flung inside and there I am trying to fit in, wanting to fit in but getting so so intimidated!   Everyone here seems so confident of what they are doing and saying and whats worse is that they are probably doing the right things, though who decides what is RIGHT and WRONG I am yet to discover. I come from a different culture and background. I have always excelled in academics but here I find myself doubting my ability. Will I be able to cope with the new system? Will I ever belong?   There seems to be a yearning to be accepted and appreciated, that I am terrified that revealing my true self, which I am not too sure about, might mess up all my chances. Every one seems to be better than me, be it in terms of making friends, getting adjusted or simply being themselves. I feel that every second person is laughing at me. I feel so lonely inn this huge university. This is the worse feeling to have, feeling alone in a crowd!   They say that everyone feels the same way in the beginning. But do I believe that? Obviously not! Here I sit in RLM writing frantically about my nervous self and everyone around me is reading either their reference books or a newspaper, no matter what they do, they seem to be at peace with themselves. that is what I am hoping that sooner ar later (sooner if it were up to me) I will achieve. I came here to let my self lose. To undo the shackles that had bound me to a not too pleasant past when it came to self esteem. I want to be able to do that. I want to be able to be the person that lives in my dreams. Again am I trying to be someone that I am not? I know that it is not in me to go up to a stranger and start of a conversation. I stop after " Austin is so hot"! Is it wrong? Does that make me in any way lesser than the rest? Rationally speaking obviously not. that is the kind of person I am. But everyone I seem to come across is so extroverted. I know that there is no such thing as right person or wrong person but feeling seem to surpass reason at this point. is it because I grew up with asister who was always popular because of her looks and her gift of the gab. Who had all the night life I never had, and said I never wanted. Is it because of the mother I had. Always the center of attention because of her looks and her brilliance, because of her great achievements and ideals. I don't think it fair to push the buck on to someone else. I must learn to take responsibility for myself.  It is so strange. I always wanted to come down here. It was the perfect picture. I was going to start afresh. This was going to be the birth of a new self. What happened? Am I giving up all too soon? Am I alone in feeling this way? Will this small fish find her way in the large ocean? Will someone notice the wallpaper? Will I be able to come out of this a surer person? WILL I BE ABLE TO FIND MYSELF, FOR BETTER OR FOR FOR WORSE, IN THIS CONTINUOUS FIGHT TO FIND MY PLACE IN THIS PUZZLE. (that is assuming that I have a place!) 
__label__label0 First of I would like to clear something up. Yes you did pay for ORGNAME's but for the money you paid I wore PROPNAME and Target clothes and ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also hardly think that the $00 a month you paid for me equates to the Hundreds you pay for PROPNAME. Second I paid for that Fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at ORGNAME. In no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. I did earn a lot of money this summer. I spent very little of it and saved most of it - so YOU wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. I don't think having a car is a sign of love- I think it is a sign of favoritism. That's what makes me cry and get really upset. The two main reason's PROPNAME got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and Dad obviously identifies with him more. Nevermind that I try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. I guess maybe if I act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one I could get a little appreciation in this family. Having a car here is imparactical and honestly, I don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. The damamge is done. My whole life I felt loved and I'm not saying I don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. I was very upset. Not that I didn't mean what I wrote, but I could of said it in a kinder way. I had a really long talk about it with Will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. The reason I get so upset is not because I want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. Logically I know it means nothing, but I still hurt when I think about it. I'm really confused. I think I get emotional about it because I think it's so unfair, I can't do anything about it, and I get so mad I cry. Another thing I have observed is I can't talk to dad about it. I don't know why I feel it necessary to "protect him" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. I guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that "he couldn't afford it" I can't even really talk about it with you; I have to write about it. I guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I get sad about it because I don't understand why I feel this way and no one understands my feelings. I really meant it when I said I didn't know what could return me to the way I felt before the incident. And all the while I'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. I was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. Here, no one LOVES me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that I was SURE of at home. The car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why I'm upset about it. I KNOW that objects don't measure love. It's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. I guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. This letter itself is really ironic in some way. I write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here I am up at midnight worrying about yours. well I'm going to bed now, I've got school and work tomorrow. 
__label__label1 We got a new couch today in our dorm room, I think that I like it but it has a kind of weird smell to it. I put some febreeze on it , I mean what can you expect from a 00 dollar garage sell couch. I am becoming kind of concerned about the study habits that I am developing here in LOCNAME. It seems that every day I do nothing and at night I realize that I have all this work to do and that I have not actually done any of it. I stay up late doing work and don't get enough sleep. So all day I feel tired. I wish that I had not ate so much tody. My stomach is seriously hurting me. I think that since I have come to Austin I am still eating a lot but I have stopped all physical activity. I really should go to the gym or go running or atleast get some of the guys around here to go play some basketball or something. I feel realy guilty right now, I was supposwd to go to churh tonite at 00, but I didn't get back from eating out with my friends until around 00. My mom called me after I had got in and I told her that I had gone at ten and that I was just getting back. I don't feel so bad about lying as I really do about not going. I consider myself to be afairly devote ORGNAME, this is the first time that I can remember not going to church on a sunday. I tried to remember, I was sure that I had missed atleast once before, but I thought about it for along time and this is the first time in forever that I have not been on a sunday. I'm thinking right now how easier it would be to write this if my roomate and his girlfriend were not here. I keep feeling like they are reading what I am writing, and I think that I am right, those bastards, just kiddin they are both reallygood friends. They just called me out on calling them bastards, they thought it was kind of funny. They just put on mtv, man I hate the Backstreet boys. And that would be 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 right now I'm a little bit stressed anb  about getting all my homework done that is do on friday due tommorrow  and getting enough sleeop at the same time  never enough time   too much to due too little time  I also need to clean up my room and do the dishes. I should also say that I only have one arm to type this because the other one is in a cast so I probably wont write as much as everyone else. although have a lot of homework to do tonite, I'm happy because I only have one class tomorrow and then the weekend is here and I don't have any classes to go to. I'm also happy that this is such an easy assignment and that we get credit for it. my roomate is bothering me quite a bit at the moment cause he wont shut up. I really don't like him very much, but at least he is just my roomate and I don't have to hang out with him. now I hope that he doesn't see what I wrote. I'm excited about this weekend cause it will be time to get away from school. I don't know or care what I'm doing though. maybe I shouldnt feel this way so early in the year, but I just don't feel like doing all of the work I have to do for school, I would rather just sit in the living room and watch tv and relax. I'm tired now and I feel like going to sleep, but the nthought of my math hw wont let me relax until it is all done. now I'm wondering if someone is actually going to read all of these writing assignments, I feel sorry for whoever has to do that, but I guess they are divided up between the ta's. my twenty mins is almost up so I'm thinking about what I'm goin g to write for the next ass. well twenty mins is up now, so goodbye. 
__label__label1 I need to get to my dorm soon so I can get ready to work out that place was so crowded yesterday, there wasn't hardly any machines open, maybe today since it's a different time the machines will be open with more of a selection. I hope they are serving something good for dinner, I didn't like those spicy chicken nuggets for lunch, I'm starting to get hungry now, but I know you shouldn't eat before you work out. I wonder if anyone will actually read this, they must see some weird things when going through all of these. This seems like it will be a fun and interesting class, but my geology class is going to be difficult for me. I never have liked science classes. Chemistry was the worst class I took in high school. I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore, but I'm not exactly thrilled about being here either, I thought it would be tons of fun, but it hasn't been the greatest yet, I guess I neeed to give it more time to see if I'll find more friends, all the girls in my dorm seem to be really nice, maybe I can become good friends with them, but then I think about my friend back home and the close relationships I had, I think that I'll never friend any more friends that close, but I guess I needd to give it more time, I haven't even been here a week yet. I wonder if classes will get harder next week, I'm scared I'll have too much work to do. I hope all the work I have to do on the computer can get done, hopefully the labs won't get too full. I wonder why they haven't opened the lab in my dorm yet It seems like they would when school starts, but they are waiting until monday. They should know the professors assign work the first day, I wish the computer in my room would hook up to the internet but I know It's probably too old to connect with the ethrocard, and even if I got that I know it would be so slow, just like it was when it was connected at my house. At least it's there if I ever need to type an essay or any kind of paper. But, may be at christmas I can get a new computer. Christmas seems so far away, but I bet once school gets going the time will fly by. It'll be nice to have almost a whole month for Christmas break. Wow I've written a lot. I didn't think I would think of anything to write about. But I just let my thoughts flow and look how much I've jumped aroud I went to about 0 different subjects. And now my time is almost up. I'm kind of worried the assignment for some reason won't get to you, like it will get lost on the internet or something, I don't trust computers all that much I would feel better If I turned it in personally but hopefully it gets there. Yeah times up see you in class!!! 
__label__label0 The first thought that enters my mind is that I have no idea what I am going to say in this assignment. I have no thoughts or feelings except that I am trying to think about what to say. These types of assignments are difficult for me because I usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. Because I am a guy, sex just popped into my head. Because I am male, I hope I do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. For the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings I will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. This being my first college writing assignment, I am a little nervous that I may be doing this wrong. I must change my previous statement that I am confused. It is more of a fear that I will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. My next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time I had left. Only fourteen minutes left. Yahoo.   I just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. It is not that I like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at PROPNAME for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. I can't wait). I just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. This is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. I just saw an empty Dr. Pepper can in the garbage can and I thought I might like one, but then I realized that I wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. My next thought was that I wish I had a thesaurus right now because I have used the word "assignment" too many times. Excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. It was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because I believe he might go "postal" at anytime. I had a thought before this person came to the door, but I forgot it now. It's okay because I only have to write for seven more minutes. I am wondering what my "Quote of the Day" will be on my board outside my dorm. I want to use a quote from the movie "What About Bob" but I'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. Again, I am having the problem of not knowing what to say. It must stem from my lack of self-esteem. I just glanced at the clock and found that I only have to write for two more minutes. I just realized that I should not have written that down because I could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences. If this "assignment" was supposed to show me how my mind works, I am not pleased with the results. It shows me that my mind does not work that well at all. My only "sensation" in the last twenty minutes is that I have to go to the bathroom     
__label__label1 Right now, I'm thinking about my physics lab and the fact that I did really poorly on that lab. I need to maintain a good gpa in order for me to get into the business school, and I don't want my lab grade to impede my admission. But even if I do get into the business school, do I really want to do something in that field?  I mean I didn't declare a major at first because I didn't want to commit myself too soon to a field of study. i've always been interested in music. i do want to major in that but my parents aren't that fond of the field. so Either I double major, which is impossible in the business school, or I don't do what I really want to do--that is major in music. No matter what I major in, I will have to maitain a very good gpa throughout college since I want to study abroad in england--the country where I've always wanted to live. mainly because of the fact that it is home to my favorite sport of all time--cricket. no one really knows about the sport here. i wish a lot more people did know about it so they could relate to the joy that I feel while watching the sport. i guess to enjoy a particular sport, or anything for that matter, u have to be born in that environment. back in pakistan, everyone loves the sport and it's like a religion. i sure do wish that LOCNAME had won the world cup in june. all that hard work went out the window when they played so poorly in the final. anyway, I hope to become a cricketer myself in the future. but that's not a career that is looked upon as being a good one. and the cricket board in pakistan is really a mess. a lot of good players are neglected because they don't have connections with members of the board. i have a cold and I've been sneezing since all day yesterday. god it's so painful to sneeze 00 hours a day. i took a dayquill last night but even dayquills seem to make me drowsy. Now, on top of the sneezing, I have to deal with trying to stay awake in my classes. i'm waiting for my roommate to come so we can go eat. gosh I hate the food in jester. i mean it's the same old stuff everyday. at times like this, I really miss home and my mom's cooking. the weather over here today is pretty good. better than the previous month has been. i want to go play golf but I don't know where any of the golf courses are. i guess I'll ask my roommate's friend who plays golf. 
__label__label1 I really miss my family. School here is fast paced and big. Ice cream was good tonight. Wish I could see PROPNAME PROPNAME I love him he's so cool and fun to be with. I wish PROPNAME would call me why hasn't he called yet?  I wish that I\I had my old bed here with me now I want to have fun I think that I am really tired right now. I need sleep I should be sleeping not typing it's hard to clear your mind because there are so many things to think about how's PROPNAME doing?  I miss her she's so cute I wish I could pick her up and hug her right now. I wish that I weren't in schhol again already. I love the eagles. I'm just running down the road trying to loosen my load got seven women on my mind. what I don't have any women on my mind I guess my mom well I like my screen saver a lot. The elephant sounds and the frog is really cute. I need to eat more regularly. ever since I got here I haven't been eating enough. Am I homesick?  Is it too hard to keep in contact with people here?  yes it is. Too many people. I wanted a big school but I don't think I knew what I was getting into. I just want to be successful  I wan't to meet people and to make lasting and important relationships I want to get married I wish I could sleep and think and not have to stay up doing random assignments that will hav no effect on my life whatsoever. I know that college is worth the trouble but sometimes I wish I didn't have to be here-I didn't have to grow up. I know that everything will work out why has G. J. been treating me like he has I am just an old flame am I boring to him now?  why did last night he say that he was tired and wanted to sleep but then when his friend called he was ready to do something  why does he always have to be so selfish I always do things for othewr people and I w\usually think about him and what he would want constantly am I getting taken advantage of I am sore I have been working out a lot lately. I need to go run and clear my thoughts I wish my bed were here. I hate the new bed. I can't ever sleep. My first monday is tomorrow and I'm not excited about it. whhy/  coffee would be good now I'm a caffeine addict. I love it just like I love gj just like I wish he were here right now. what am I going to do for the rest of the night/ why hasn't jenny called me where are all of my friends?  I miss juli. she's a really good friend. PROPNAME is too why didn't I go canoeing with him yestereday?  should have why do I never want to talk to him anymore do I think that he wants me more than I would like. I still have 0 minutes left. just looked at the clck I hope that's allowed. maybe not but probably is okay because I really was wondering how much time I have left PROPNAME said that he already did his assignment he's a nerd though no wonder he can't get girls to fulfill his needs anthony just called he said he only made 00 bucks but he just rode around on a kayk all day. church was cool anthony should have come witrh me. PROPNAME should come and eat lunch me tomorrow he says he wants too. fun fun. I wonder if I'm going to run out of meals my roommate is on the desk right now she's pretty wierd I've known her since fourth grade and she still seems wierd to me oh well maybe she always will. I wish justrin would call. why wont he? probably has a girlfriend. Like I have a boyfriend that's been treating me like shit that's always nice- love that hate guys sometimes well I have about two or three minutes left. Gosh roommmate is inging now what the hell is felicia singing/  She can't sing. I can sing better than she can. I hope you appreciate reading this if you ever do because it is emotionally straining at this time of night for me to write all of this. Hmm. my 00 minutes is over How time flies when life's a bitch 
__label__label1 The thoughts that are running through my mind at the moment deal with my studies. I am trying to do as much studying this week before the weekend when all my friends from LOCNAME are comming in. I'm having trouble accomplishing this because I haven't managed my time to have enough time to study. I'll go to the library for about 0 hours and feel like I haven't learned anything. Aside from school, everything is going well. I have a boyfriend back in LOCNAME and we are working the "long distance relationship" good. He is visiting me this weekend and so far we have seen one another every weekend. I have been with him for almost two years and ever since I have come to college, I am worried it will not work out. He is 00 years old and doesn't have a successful future as of right now. He is attending a junior college, but he isn't doing much there and he doesn't set goals for himself. I am starting to realize the importance of school and my future. I don't want to waste years of my life with someone that can't provide a future for me. I went potluck this year at my dorm. We get along great. The only flaws I can see as of right now is that she is on the phone all the time and that she sleeps really early. It bothers me that everytime someone calls for mr she tells them shes on the other line and to call back. I cannot do anything past 00:00 in the room for I feel I am interupting her sleep. This is difficult for me because I'm so used to sleeping late and doing little things like playing on the computer or watching television before going to bed. Today I only had one class which was economics. I don't think I did very well on our quiz today and I think it will be my hardest class this semester. I am currently in the college of liberal arts as undeclared and I am scared of not being able to get into the business school. I am positive that I want an office job. I am lookin into commuinications as a back up of business. It bothers me how people got into business school just because they were in the top 00% of their senior class, because I went to a ver competitive school with many smart students as where many of the students went to small schools or schools that I know I couldv'e been top ten in. I was happy to be in the top 00% in my school which took a lot of hard work. Throughout high school I took an English class at a junior college and I just found out that the official transcript I had sent had no grade on it to tranfer for credit here at ut, so I had to call the college to send another one to UT. my dorm room just got painted and it still smells in here. The people in my wing are friendly. Last night I went to an ORGNAME meeting. Here I met people the same race as I(Filipino). This was interesting to see how many Filipinos are on campus and a good way to meet people since I haven't really been associationg with people I've never met yet. I'm looking forward to play co-ed sports with this association and meeting other FSA members from LOCNAME,U of H, and ORGNAME. My older sister was part of this organization and she got a lot out of it. My sister has been an importmant part of my life. She is a motherly figure, but younger. She has been a great role model and is there for me whenever I need her. For the rest of the day I plan on going to the library and studying and going out later on tonight. I'm looking forward to this weekend. I also have to vacuum our room and do laundry. I went to church here in LOCNAME for the first time recently and it was very ackward. I have gone to church every sunday in the past with my family and it was weird being there by myself. I started to tear because all these memories of my family and the church arised in my mind. I've realized that recently I have been crying a lot. It's usually emotions built up in my mind of my boyfriend. He has been really nice and caring lately then he was when I was at home. I swam while I was in high school and was going to the gym at least 0 times a week. As I have been in college I have taken fewer trips to the gym. I have been lazy or too busy worrying about school. I have been gettin 0-0 hours of sleep lately. It's not that I stay up late, but its the fact that I am tired and can't fall asleep. I think it is probably caused by stress. I want to go home soon because I need to buy many things for my dorm. It's hard not having a car and being able to go wherever you want when you please. I am eating ramen noodles for the first time as a college student. I ate them at home about twice a week so I'm used to it. The food here at the dorm gets old. I get sick of the same things and same tastes everyday. I think I may be gaining weight. I really need to go running. Our televison is finally working and I can watch my soap opera. I really miss my family, dog, and friends back home. In a way I wish I had stayed back. 
__label__label0 I am tired today. I should have gone to bed earlier. I need to study. How much do I need to read for my classes to get A's in them? I have to do my economics homework today. I miss home I miss my family. I have never been away from home for this long. I won't get to see my parents till parents weekend but that will be really nice. I have a fraternity meeting at 0:00. I can't wait until the next football game, the game this past weekend was awesome. I need to wear a hat at the next game cause I got a bad sunburn last weekend. My face hurts from the sunburn still. I wonder when our next fraternity mixer will be. A picture reminds me of my LOCNAME trip last summer. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I have a paranoid feeling that I am not doing enough work or studying, that I am neglecting something. I hate doing laundry, I have already had to do it twice since I've been in LOCNAME. It hasn't rained since I've been here, I wonder when it will rain. I hate the heat and humidity in LOCNAME. I can't wait till it cools down and turns into fall. The girl in my business administration class yesterday was very pretty, maybe I can go on a date with her sometime this semester. ORGNAME merged with ORGNAME, maybe ORGNAME won't be such a lousy network anymore. I need to eat lunch soon. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I hope I will have time to study tonight, I need colored pencils to finish my economics assignment, maybe my roommate has some. 
__label__label1 I have heard of assignments like this one before, but never thought that I would sit at my computer for 00 minutes just typing away. but, thats what you want so here I go: hmmmm, I have a lot of work to get done, I need to get my girlfriend's birthday card written and sent out, her bday is on the 00th of this month. we have an interesting relatiosnship. she is going to AM next year so that makes me wonder a little, also, my parents don't know we are together, they would never accept her since she is white. I think thats bull shit personally. I have told my parents they are prejudice, they don't understnad that term I think. yeah, but we broke up before I went to LOCNAME this year so that we could just be friends but she doesn't think that fbeing fiends is right. she says either we get back together or don't weven talk anymore, so I got back together. I think it was like an ultimatum, she says that normal human beings would react the way that she did. I question that, heck, you could probably tell me since you're a psychology professor with a ph. d. in something related to psychology I assume. hmmmm, I think we are going to break up, just makes sense, but I don't want to hurt her and who kn ows, she maybe that ONE person and I may be throwing that away, which is a dumb thing to do. yeah, well, I also have lots of reading to do which I better get started on soon. my roommate and suitemate have gone to the library at least every other day and have done all there reading, but I haven't doneany of it. in high school, I never had to bother with any of that. the day before the test, iw oudl read up and be set. I know that won't work here proabbly but yet I still don't take the initiative to read. I think I may just be lazy, or I may tghink too much of myself and find mysefl screwed come sept. 00 since thats my first test, or its spet 00, eithe ron. e   hmmmm, man, dobie food sucks a lot, I ts good I guess but its just that I get so used to it and I hate standing in line. ,. yup yup. theres a lot of dumb bullshit things also, luike I have a friedn tht tells me "oh, man, be careful when you hang out with them, they blah blah blah and all this. "  they don't do anythingillegal, they just party or have minor problems if anythuing. let em figure tht out you know, she is quick to give me her opinon and I don't even ask for it. ppl that I respect because the hyave been successful, she says man, he is full of shit. whatevefr, he gets his stuff done and is very scuccessful (I am having a lunch meteting with him to figure out the stuff I should be doing and joining etc. ) and she thinks that he is jsut full of shit. I don't care really to hear it but I can't tell her to shut the *(& up because thats also wrong. sometimes, the situation demands to be mean or atleast abrasive, but thats difficult (not beacuse I don't know how to, I do, I am a former debater) but because its nott eh impression I wantt o give out. well I am getting tired right now, but there is only a few minutes left so I might as well continute. hmmmm, not much else is going on here. yeah there is this big thing about going and partying and drinking and etc,. definitely not my sceneinking, never done it, no inteention to, I just don't want to, but there is definitely pressure created when your firends (Since like age 0) are doing it, and then you wonder why not, might as well. hmmmm, I strill haven't but then again, I have gone home to houston every weekend so far to visit my mom and make sure everything is okay sin e no one else is home (my dad is in india of r business ) and I also went home to see alsion (my girlfriend of 0. 0 years)  that myb the reason she wants to saty together or not even get together, I think she is too attached (she says she loves me more than she has ever loved) she is my first girlfriend ( I love her, I think ) what is love? its a personal point of view that can nver be defined. there are too many differntt types of love, and then even romantic love is interpreted differently. I thinks thats weird. I have siad I love you and so has she but we may mean (although same principle) two completely different things. I think thats interesting. well, thats it my 00 miutes are up, I have been watching ORGNAME and typing at the same time, and man, there a bunch of fine girls at LOCNAME, but I don;t think I will get any of them (oh well, I have alison and I don';t want any of thme rright now, buts its nice to know that you could get those irls if youw ant to you know) oh well, thats me thinkin gabout sex again. hehehhe. thats it, enjoy this, I certainly did typing it. see  you (keep this confidential -- I must assume it is) 
__label__label1 I am really really really hot. I don't know what to say. My girlfriend just called she's going to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I have some pretty messed up feelings about that. To a certain extent I feel kinda abandoned going here to UT. All of my friends are going to that amazing just right school for them. Me. I took the easy cheap way out. I knew that I could get in here, so I only applied here. Thats not to say that I don't like it here, I really do. I think that it will be interesting. I am really hungry. My roomate isn't here, he's working. I get to go to the dining hall all by myself, and I get to sit down, all by myself, and I get to proceed to eat. all by myself. I really like my room. I don't know why, but for some reason It has just taken over and become home. I'm not sure what to think about this expirement. I know that I've done stream of concious writing before because I took some creative writing classes, but now I'm afraid that this is going to be used to analyze my brain and you're going to use it to steal my credit card number, and forge all sorts of stuff. Speaking of credit cards, I got my first today, and had to send it home with parents because you can only activate the cards from your home phone, what kind of messed up shit is that?  I'm sorry, I really should stop swearing. For some reason my mouth has to the potty since I started. I  d o n ' t  k n o w  w h a t  to  say. I'm sort of bored right now. And I'm sort of in a strange dillema. This is going to sound sort of like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I don't know if I love my girlfriend. I mean, I do, that's not the issue. It's that she's going to LOCNAME LOCNAME, and I'm here. And I don't know what to do about that. I'm going out to see her at thanksgiving. I really miss what she brought to my life. It was that feeling of completeness. I know that this is bad, but I'm already starting to look around for something to replace that feeling that is gone. I think that long distance relationships suck. You know that I can type really really fast. Sometimes I think that I can type faster than I can think. Or maybe thats the other way around. Maybe that's the reason this is turning into somany things that I don't know were floating around inside my head. It is right now five fifty. I have ten minutes to go. I can't believe that you're going to actually read this. That is really impressive. I can't imagine reading six hundred different stream of concience writings. I think that either your going to grade them pass fail, or you're an insomniac with nothing better to do with your time. I really wish that I could have a totally silent computer. You know, that's not random, It has to the fact that right now it is humming. I would put in some music, but that would mean taking my hands from off of the keyboard, which is illegal. So instead I'll play the game by the rules, and sing along to something in my head. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME----eeen PROPNAME, Jen. She doesn't fucking care are are. Whether I like her or not. Okay that didn't really work out. I hate how you can only remember the lyrics to one part of a song. You end up singing like this. Word Word Word, dum dum dee dum. This shit would be really funny if I could instead speak it to you. I gaurantee that I'm the guy who will never shut up. Although lately I feel that maybe I've been too quiet. I think it may be time to sing something in the dining hall, maybe that will make people want to sit with me. Only five minutes left. That means I can eat by my badass lonely self. It should be fun. Maybe I'll call this girl I know. The problem with that is that I don't know where or friendship begins and ends. I don't know if she even considers me a friend. Its a total fucking mystery to me. I want to sit her down and tell her look. I think that I like you. The problem is that I'm afraid of rejection and failure and all of that bad stuff. You see I think that maybe I would make a good psychiatrist, because I've been through some weird shit, and that would help me to understand what was going on in other people's minds. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just totally fucking alone in the world. It's a frightening thought. And there I go with the swearing thing again. I would go back and edit it for langauge and content, but I figure that you probably won't be reading this thing anyways, so what does it matter. I like the fact that you seem to know how to handle a big class. Sorry, I don't even know why I seem to be writing this to you. I really should be writing this to myself. And if I was writing this to myself, I think that maybe I would rather just mull over it in my own head, as opposed to online, on paper, on something. So that's what I'm going to do. Good bye LOCNAME LOCNAME 
__label__label1 I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book PROPNAME, by PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of PROPNAME PROPNAME in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like PROPNAME, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but PROPNAME could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five0 times after that too because it's so good. I really like PROPNAME PROPNAME, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and Lord PROPNAME. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about PROPNAME and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 000% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. 
__label__label1 I don't know if I should go home or not this weekend. I want to stay, but. I hope my computer doesn't freeze while I'm writing this, that would totally suck  I'm glad I'm getting this out of the way, normally I would wait till the last possible second, but I don't trust computers since I've been here. I really want to like it here but I just don't. All my friends that went to oter schools are having a great time, they're meeting new people doing new things, but evryone I meet bores me, it seems as though everyone is the same. I don't even feel like going out and having fun. The only reason I want to is so mabe I'd come to like UT better. I see so many people I know, its kinda weird, when theres about fifty thousand people here. I'm a business major but the only class that is relavant to busins is my freshman BA class which meets only once a week. I'm afraid I'm not goingto find the parties here that much fun. From what I've heard its just people getting drunk and thats not that much fun. I worry that all the expectations I've had about college are misconceptions. I love this keyboard. I like typing, but I can't use regular desktops, because I can't sit still. I sund like a dumbass when I repeat myself. PROPNAME told me the funniest joke but I can't remember it although when he told me I tried to memorize it. I hate it here when I think about hte people at home. I have no one here. I'm so bored. My classes are boring for the mostpart, and I'm finally getting the hang of schedules and shit. I want to call my cousin, who is my role model and ask if she liked her first month in colllege. She always putwss me in a good mood. PROPNAME says there ids nothing wrong with my comp but why the hell does it keep freezing?  I think twenty minutes are almost up nope I still have bout ten to go. My tth classes are so long. I start gettig restless- that music next door is so loud and I am so tired I want to take a nap. I had to wake upa a t 
__label__label0 Hmm. let's see. what to write about. since we're on the topic of psychology, I was in awe when I first walked into the auditorium the first day of class. there were more people in that room than in my entire graduting class last year. it was a pretty impressive sight, but also a bit omnious. so far I like my classes, but all of them are bigger than my highschool classes, but then again what am I supposed to expect with a school population of near 00,000 people as opposed to my 0000 high school population. man, I like this internet homework. this way you don't have to worry about keeping up with papers and the like. I used to loose most of my homework back in the day because I'm not that organized of a person. speaking of internet, you got to love this internet hookup in the dorm rooms. I like the fact that I can be in the internet and still have the phone line free. my parents used to hate when I'd tie up the phone line checking my e-mail. since all my friends went to different colleges, it's amazing how handy e-mail really is. I've already talked to a few of them using some aol instant messanger. it's kind of funny really, to see how many of your old high school friends keep in touch over the school year, or keep in touch at all for that matter. I've been in contact with some of my good friends, but also been surprised at not hearing from 0 or 0 close ones. I think I decided that I'm going back for our high school's homecoming on sept 00. supposedly a lot of my friends are going to, and I'd really like to see them. I'm also going back this next weekend (labor day weekend)  seems that I forgot to pack a lot of stuff, or didn't even thing of stuff, that I ended up needing in college. I guess in a way it's kind of hard to pack for moving away, because you don't know exactly what you'll need until you get there. it must seem to you by now that I'm relating a lot of stuff back to high school. well don't go over analyzing it or anything, it's just what I'm basing a lot of my college experiences on so far. it's funny, I never had to read or study back in high school. it just sort of came to me naturally through teacher lectures. but here I'm actually having to adjust and take notes, read the book, etc. having to pull a 000 is weird, but I think I'm doing a good job so far. man, I hope my laundry's not done yet. I still have a few more minutes go to writing, but I just hate it when people put their stuff in the dryer or washer and leave, only to come back an hour later when there's a huge line forming to use it. heh, I guess I should start practicing what I preech, but I figure I've got tons of time to start doing that. most likely I'll start when I get out of schoo, get married, and have kids so I don't set a bad example. yeah, I eventually want to have kids, and I stress eventually. I've got so many good one liners that I've inherited from my parent's, along with a few that I thought up all on my own, that I can't wait to try out on my youngins. hmm, I seem to have a bit of a problem. I forgot when I started typing my mindless babbling. I think I still have a few minutes left. this assignment reminds me of a book I had to read last year in english. well, I didn't have to because I didn't, but we were supposed to. it was. a portrait of an artist as a young man. I remember it because the author used a lot of stream of conciousness in the book, which made it harder to follow and understand, thus less appetising to me to read. I did however, download the cliffs notes off the internet and read those, so I guess I didn't totally slack off. I just. took a shortcut. ok, I think my sentence is served, so I'm going to go check on my laundry. 
__label__label1 I am sitting here on my bed in my dorm room. It is 00:00 at night  on a  wednesday. My friend is sitting here with me and we are about to watch the movie  Go. We just came back from brians room where we watched Pulp Fiction. My foot  kinda itches. I feel like I ate too much today. I am mad at myself because I  smoked two cigarettes today and I don't usually smoke unless I drink alcohol,  but it was fun anyway. I really hate to read and study, I would so rather go  out and party or even just hang out with people. I kinda feel like I get behind  because I am a slow reader and I can't comprhend all of the information in one  sitting. I keep losing concentration. I really want a rug in my room. I just  boiled some water to make coffee for suzanne and I . I am really gald I don't  do drugs or deal them. I kinda have a headache. I am really stressed out right  now about getting all of my work done. I need to find two monologues by friday,  type them up and read the plays they come from. I really want to be a good  successful actress when I graduate from collge and move back to LOCNAME I know it  doesn't look like I wrote a lot but I am just ti 
__label__label0 It is just past one a. m. and I feel like doing this now. I'm not really tired and know that I should go to bed because I have to go to class at eight tomorrow. I've done all of my homework and am extremely bored. I just got off the internet with my boyfriend back at home, which would be LOCNAME. He's lonley just like me and we have been talking for about three hours. I miss him a lot and don't quite know what to do. I really don't have a lot of friends here. I had seven best friends that I grew up with since around fourth grade and all seven of them went to ORGNAME. I really feel left out. They all e-mail me and tell me what a great time they are having and I wish I were with them. I've wanted to come here since I was in fifth grade though, so this is a dream come true for me. I just wish I had someone to talk to. They were always there for me and we always had a great time. I also miss my family, which is probably to be expected in the first weeks of college. My brother called me today, he is 00, and told me that he just got a new dwarf hamster and I know he got it just because I told him last week that they were the cutest things. He takes everything I say to heart, even if he dosen't know it. My mom's and my brother's birthday is in a week and I'm not sure if I can get home. I wasen't able to bring my car up here so I'm stuck at the mercy of my roommate. I just want to be there for their birthday's. If my roommate dosen't go home though then I'm stuck up here. I've known PROPNAME for quite a long time. For about eight years. We've never really been best friends or anything but we decided to room together because we knew we could trust each other. She is pretty neat, although she does complain a lot. I have really nothing against here though. I'm kinda hungry, if you would like to know that. Instead of eating dinner I went down the hall and watched the ORGNAME music awards and ate candy and popcorn and I'm still hungry. I don't want to have to get up in the morning. When I scheduled my classes I should not have put four classes in one day, but I had no choice. I'm really regretting it now though. Homework is hard to do if it all has to be done on the same day. I'm also taking an aerobics class and it is quite fun. I never expected it to be so physical though. I know you are supposed to exercise and all, it's just that it hurts. I am so out of shape and it just makes me aware of that fact. My eyes are getting all fuzzy. And it is very cold. I'm getting tired now and I think it is because of all the blue writing on the white background. I wasen't tired before. So, my twenty minutes is almost up and I might go to bed now. I doubt it, I am a night person. I'd rather stay up all night and sleep all day. That would be great. Well, I'll talk to you in the next writing assignment. 
__label__label0 I really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. It annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. Just a few minutes ago I was trying to wash my towels and I couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. I felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. It's not like I would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but I feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. Well I built up the courage because I was annoyed and I then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. So I had a whole who-ha over nothing. Oh well. I actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. I love clean clothes that smell really good. I use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. I keep looking at the clock because I'm waiting for Road Rules to come on. They kicked this girl PROPNAME off last time because she has an alcohol problem. I really don't think it solved the problem at all. Now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. I guess I've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so I wouldn't know what it is like. Needless to say, PROPNAME is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. She firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. Don't they all say that? Well I hope she gets better because I know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. I think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. I know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. PROPNAME PROPNAME talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. She thinks it's a great thing. I think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. Although I am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, I think this is totally different. These kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. I think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. Ok-enough about that. I've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. I take mine in the morning and I'm in there for seriously about 0 or 0 minutes. Whereas she's in there for like 00 or so. I wonder why that is. I guess I'm in such a rush in the morning that I'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. There doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now but I guess essentially I'm doing that now. Maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'd rather focus on what's ahead tomorrow rather than the stressful day I had today, primarily in the computer lab. I've decided that I really don't like programming and the technical stuff of computers. I really don't care how it works as long as it does for me. I'll just have to put up with that class until Christmas to get my credit. I'd feel kind of sad if I was a professor and people only took my class because their academic advisor advised them too or if they just did it to fill their credits. I guess they're used to it and don't take it personally. Whatever. Ok- time's up now. I've been writing for 00 minutes as told. Bye. 
__label__label1 Today is Labor Day. This weekend I went to my family reunion in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. My cousin, PROPNAME, is recently engaged. I am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, I am a little bit jealous. I know I am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. My brother has been married a little more than four years. When he first married, I did not think too much about it. Now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. My parents have been married 00 years!  I cannot believe it. In today's world where divorce is a commonplace, I am proud of my parents for sticking together. My parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a Yorkie. Her name is PROPNAME, and I love her with all of my heart. I was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. I think I miss her more than anyone else, probably because I get to talk to other people on the phone. Brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and I cannot wait until I see her again. College life is so much different than high school. I t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. I really do not feel older. For some reason, I always feel young. When I think about all the petty gossipy things I worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. Once people enter college they change so much. For instance, I have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. However, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. I am really concerned about my grades. I really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. I want to be a child psychologist. Psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. I love children, and I also love helping people. I figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. When I become a mom, I want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. This way, I can spend lots of time with my own children. I also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. If I worked all day, I do not think I would have time. This summer I started cooking, and I found that it is quite enjoyable. It is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. I would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. I also need to find a job. I did not realize how much money college consumes. I feel bad asking my parents for money. Plus, I worked at The Pottery, a local shop in LOCNAME, for a little more than a year, so I am not used to needing money from my parents. My mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. I love my parents/family very dearly. They are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that I have ever known. My family is also very generous. I just hope that I will turn out to be the kind of people they are. 
__label__label0 why am I so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in my life, I have no clue. Its probably becasue I'm a freshman or is it because I just don't know what I'm am doing in this school, it's too hard. I don't know how to work the computer system, I have tons of homework, and its all catching up to me at the same time, it's unreal. I'm so bogged down with work and I have so much stuff to do but I'm sitting here typing on my computer on something that I don't know will even get sent to you. My friends are talking to me while I'm trying to write this assignment, and I can't' make my mind focus on on certain thing at all, the music is too loud and I have people trying to talk to me over the internet. these blinking lights are pissing me off I wish these people would shut up and let me tend to my business at hand. I need to read, do my pre cal and I just don't have the time. I don't know how to do my physical science lab, and reading just takes too muck time. I have a date tonight,  I don't have time to take them out, but I have to or that wouldn't be nice, I'm going through rush and that takes up more time than anything. I can't' deal with this anymore. I'ts starting to drive me crazy , but hopefully soon I will get used to it. Its such a change from senior year to freshman year of college. you go from doing nothing basically to have to read every night and do all sorts of written assignment, it's impossible twenty minutes is up got to run 
__label__label1 well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 0rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the "rountine" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the ORGNAME meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at LOCNAME. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to ORGNAME yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 0 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon. 
__label__label0 Jeez, why has it taken my so long to do this assignment?  Why do I always put everything off to the last minute???  Procrastination seems to have effected my whole life. Even when I was a little kid in elementary school I can rememeber putting off projects till the last night. My mom would always get mad and say you should wait till the last minute to do things, but for some reason that just never got through to me. I don't want to procrastinate. but it do. I always tell myself that I'm going to start it early, but it always ends up the same way. Is this the way it's going to be my whole life?  Man, I hope not, but who am I kidding. This is the way my brain functions. Procrastination is apart of me. I love the saying, hard work pays over time, but laziness pays off now. That's like my motto. Even though I wish it wasn't. I wish I could be like those kids who when they got a project assigned in school, to run home and start it right away. I wish my brain would say, lets get all of this hard work out of the way so we can have fun and relax later. But of course the reality is my brain is saying, well since the project isn't do for another week that means I don't have to start it for another week, I can just sit back and relax until then. AAGGGHHHH!  I always tell myself I'm going to change my ways, but it never freaking happens. Well I know I'm not the only one with this problem. I know most other college kids puts things off to the last minute too. But dammit, when I think about it really pisses me off. I should have written this essay last week, but no. Here I am, Sunday night, writing an essay that is due tomorrow. it's just like clockwork. I always put off studying too. I really need to study for tests in advance, but I always wait till the night before to do practically all of my studying. A lot of times I wake up early that moring and study before the test. Damn you procrastination, damn you to hell!  It's going to be the death of me. I can just imagination how much better of a gpa I would have if I would just study more. Things have got to change, or I'm really going to screw up bad. Dammit. All of this writing about procrastination had gotten my thinking about my mom. I know she worries about me. She knows I always procrastinates. I wish she didn't have to worry about me doing ok in school. She didn't have to worry about my older brother. He was an A student. She never had to worry about him making good grades, because he always did. Man, I wish I had his life. His a great job now, makes a good salary, and his future is extremely bright. Now look at me. i'm a C student with and undeclared major. I really don't know what I'm going to do once I get out of college. Thinking about that scares me sometimes. Well it looks like my twenty minutes minutes are about up. Let me just say it's been fun and I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this?  I doubt it, I bet there just going to check to makes sure I've written something cause reading everyones in class would take a hella long time. What's up with the size of our class?  I walked into the room the first day and I was like, damn!  I've never been in a class this big. I feel sorry for the people that get to class only five minutes early, jeez even fifteen minutes early and nearly 0/0's the place is already filled up. Classes just should be this book. Well I guess that's all have to say about that. see  you later. 
__label__label1 I am wondering why I am doing this writing assignment and if I really have to because I am doing the research also. THe music that I am listening to right now is very loud. I wonder if I should go to class today. I am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that I didn't know about. The test coming up on the 00th worries me because I am not sure what it will be over or what to study. My forearm is already beginning to cramp up while I am typing. my leg itches. I like this song that is coming on now. My eyes are very tired. my head itches and I have to scratch it. I think I need to stretch my neck. I really need to start getting more sleep since I have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. There is something under my foot that is bothering me. I wonder how long I have been typing for. Only five minutes. Now I am feeling like this is going to take forever. It is kind of dark in the room that I am in. I'm thinking about pizza. now I am thinking about the girl who's room I am in. She is in the shower. I ate pizza with her for lunch. She is very beautiful. She sure has been in the shower for a long time. PROPNAME PROPNAME's songs all sound alike to me. I can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 00's or something. My mind has gone blank for a second. What time is it now. Only 0 minutes. How come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. If I was a girl I wouldn't get one. That would hurt and why go through that pain. I think the music is getting louder. Cell phones!  Everybody is getting those too. And they keep getting smaller. That reminds me of Lethal Weapon 0 when PROPNAME PROPNAME complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. I can't think of anything. I am wondering if I really have to do this. Time check. 00 minutes. It is hot. It smells like austin water. The water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. I need a chair in my room so when I watch tv I don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. My back is hurting right now. Basketball caused my back problems. I should be playing basketball right now. Everybody thinks I am obsessed with basketball because I talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. I want to be a basketball coach. I can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where I can't play or coach. I have to be a coach or I won't enjoy my job. This girl kim drops everything on her feet. I swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since I have been here. sHe just interupted my train of thought. I kind of like this stream of thought thing because I am realizing all the crazy stuff I think about in a given time. THis song satellite. i mean what the hell is he talking about. It doesn't make since. time check. one more minute till I get to hit the infamous submit button. This was kind of fun. my arm is kind of tired though. 
__label__label0 "no, I don't want your number, no, I don't want to give you mine and no, I don't want to meet you somewhere, no, I don't want none of your ti-ime. " (the song that is in my head) I am worried that I lost a green piece of paper, among other things. sigfried and roy. I am eating wheat thins. zucini. go fly a kite. there is an antropology major on this floor. my back itches. 'she sells sanctuary'. my roomate talks, talks, talks. my philosophy prof. likes to drop the chalk. "no, nosy-girl, go look at the door" (that's what I just said) she's a hobbit-girl. I like it when people breakdance. I regret that I have only one blah to give for my country. all my friends talk about is records and porn. I'm trying to hide the fact that I like ska and very confused about what I should be. I only pretend to know everything, really I don't believe anything. it's easier that way. I don't like pepsi. ut gives me pimples and blisters. I don't want to get my wisdom teeth extracted because I don't want to like medicine. I'm black at night and white during the day, my door says so. I'm thinking that I may have a vague headache. my eye don't want to be open. dammit I'm not thinking about anything at all. chicken coops and grey days. saris. "rollercoaster of love" they don't make beef alphabet soup anymore and that sucks. red old shack and a cow in the back. my roomate has a lumpy forehead and she prays funny. blah blah blah. saturn is my favourite planet. "the faces she's watching, she's watching the faces. "   
__label__label1 I'm looking at a picture of my best friend who is now in LOCNAME adn I wonder what she is doing right now. I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing at school at this very moment and why is every second centered around me like a movie or something, I think we should be able to take a sneek peek into others lives right when we want to. I've wanted to know why life isn't that easy. Pictures are supposed to make you happy and remember happy times yet when I see them I just think about times that will never take place again because they are in the past. Sometimes I seriously resent the past. I need to do my laundry and I need to put a different CD on the player because this one is getting old. I got two card for PROPNAME and I need to get off my butt and get the stamps. My mind is just full of things I need to do but I figured I would get this one done first, before I forget to do it later. I'm still hungry and I'm not sure if it is out of boredom or what. I refuse to get the freshmen fifteen because I'm happy with my weight right now. I like to workout and I need to do it more now that I have the chance right now. I hope my mom is doing well at her job right now. I also hope I get to go home for labor day to see PROPNAME for the first time in two weeks. I miss him so much, but if I stay busy it won't be that hard and will go real quick. Twenty minutes sure is a long time and I don't know how long I have been on the computer, it seems like the internet and email are the only links to people outside of LOCNAME. I would call more but bills are so expensive. I need to make my bed before I turn into a complete slob. The chair at this desk is way uncomfortable right now and my legs hurt from walking. My feet are going to look so ugly after one semester here but oh well. I'm going to get stamps after finishing this, I can't wait until it gets cold. Hot weather makes me so tired all the time. 
__label__label1 I wonder what's for dinner, sitting at the booth PROPNAME's in the room I should have brought my disk to check my e-mail I want to go see LOCNAME  LOCNAME seems so cool the apartment taking a video for steffen falling on trevors bed over and over again I got a bruise the x's on my hands are bright I hope they come off a bunch of stamped x's on my hands buildoing up, my entire body is dyed purple, the enigma, PROPNAME and PROPNAME saw him at Stars, eating at Stars see Swinging Utters the following morning after the warped tiour at Stars I want breakfast food at whaterburger I wish they didn't mess up my order last time I got lost deiving here LOCNAME seeing the deer I wish I could have held the baqby squirrel or saw it Urban Ledgends PROPNAME deosn't like those moivies  L-something movie goldie Hawn flying in the air off of that one movie with PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, the Deciever, him taking pills, a split personality pshycology class drugs don't affect a person on the test, the movie was wrong renting movies in kerrville, Emir buying Basketball for me for ORGNAME, PROPNAME and I. what to do.

Come on time 0 more minutes, hurry up I want to stop I'd like a break my head is hurting  I'm getting anxious. 00 seconads   hurry  I need to stop looking at the keyboard when I type, that's what's making me sick. 
__label__label1 Ok so right now I am thinking of the order that I plan to do things tonight and what exactly I want to do. My friend from back home is coming into town so I want to do something fun, so she will have a good time. I decided not to pledge this semester though so I don't have any fraternity hook ups any more like I did this summer so I don't know what I am going to do. I will probably call my friend PROPNAME who plays baseball for ORGNAME, he will most likely know of something that is going on. I think writing like this is really weird, I mean it is hard to believe that I am actually going to turn this in as a paper to be graded for school. It feels strange like I am doing the total wrong thing but you did say that it was a completion grade so I guess I am going to be ok. I keep looking at the time though to see how much is left, it is not that this is hard, it is just really strange, I mean I feel like I am writing a letter to one of my friends, and I'm just typing as fast as I can and saying whatever comes to mind, (to my knowledge that was the assignment) but I am NOT writing to my friend, instead I am writing to a professor and I excpect to get an A!  Oh well I just hope this is not too good to be true, these writing assignments I mean, it is like this isn't really work it is just a chance to tighten up my typing skills and kinda write a journal of sorts. Ok so I just was thinking about how I need a 0. 0 this semester in order to make sure I get into The College of Business at LOCNAME, and how that is the reason I am taking all fairly difficult classes to prove myself. well here is the thing, I had a 0. 0 as a transfer student and they still didn'tlet me in! it was because I didn't have economics, but still I had 00 hrs in just one yr of college, that is more than a great deal of people have after 0 years, at the least it is a semester ahead of schedule. so what I was thinking is how bad I want to get into business school but that I wasn't studying anything at the moment and how I really hadn't spent all my time studying but I feel that I am up to par with all of my classes but that maybe if I really want to get in I should be studying at all times and never really having fun. I mean the thing is I have decided that if I make a 0. 0 and am still not admitted I don't care, because it obviously wasn't meant to be, but I should be if I try my hardest I will not care, now I know that the only way I will be able to have peace with myself for not getting into business school is if I am condident that I gave 000% effort to get in, and I am afraid that if I am not studying and if I go out ever I will be unsatisfied and feel like a failure if I do not get in. Plus I know that if I actually bust my ass and make a 0. 0 with my schedule, people will have to take notice. well I am having troube with the canturberry tales though, I mean I am good in english but I HATE old english and trying to understand it, so when I read the canturberry tales it is like I am physically reading the pages but about 00% of the time I don't know what I am reading. so I tried to find a translation into modern english, and I found out that on the professor's test it is all basicaly quotes from characters and you have to identify, well if I don't read the original text I will not recognize the quote. Then there is business calculus, basically I was a person who was always in the honors math classes because I was an honor student but I sucked in math, like I should have been in regular math, but know I wasn't so I basicaly glided through all of my highschool math classes with b's not learning anything, so now I have an espessially hard time doing complicated math because I don't know simple math, however I know I can do this because I took college algerbra last year and yes I did have to study and get tutoring help but I ended up with an A in the class. I suppose I will have to do the same in cal. well I am doing alright in my economics class at the moment although I am a little confused as to how to draw a supply and demand graph but I am not too worried about that. This class is something that I am really interested in and I enjoy it but the truth is I am a chapter behind in the reading, I have only read chapter 0. I guess when I get done typing this I could go read ch 0, but is the start of my 0 day weekend and man, I just want to hang out, I guess everybody does though and that is what seperates the people who just wish they had something and the people who go get what the want regardless of the sacrifice. Ok so have now been over 00 mins but this was actually kind of fun. I hope this is what you were looking for. good bye byron 
__label__label0 I have never had to write like this for a class before, but I believe that I have done something similar to this on paper -- like in a journal or something. I'm not sure what I am going to write about for twenty minutes, but I guess it will not be that hard. there's a really cool song on channel 00 right now -- I heard it while I was doing my hoomework last night. it's like a live version of a song by LOCNAME. I think I'll go out and get the CD. when I have the money -- haha. this is a really cool group. I think I can get into their music. I'm  a real music lover. I think there's always a song of some sort playing in my head. I can't wait to hear a lot of the live music downtown. hopefully we (my roomates and I) will go soon. music and art are really my thing, even though right now my major is biology. I'll probably end up giving in and doing what I want to do. I just don't know how I'll make it (financially). but enough about that. lets see. gosh, PROPNAME PROPNAME is SO gorgeous. I really want to go back out there this weekend. it's so relaxing. I love being up here in austin. see, I'm from corpus christi - which is also a very pretty city - but it's just so FLAT down there. the land and everything. all we have is mesquite trees and cactus. the beach is great, but I grew up in a more rural part of south texas about 00 minutes or so from the beach. I can't imagine moving back to south texas though, not now that I've seen hills and trees. and no humidity!  my hair does great here. my parents should retire around here. might be good for thier alergies. I don't think I will live in austin forever, but as far as texas goes, I think it's the only place I might live. I want to travel though. see all the places I've never seen. maybe I'll study abroad. who knows. gosh, my parents would die. see, I'm the only child. I've already had to come home like 0 times since I moved here in august. I miss them too though. a lot. I guess maybe I'm not supposed to go off on a tangent like that. i'm just suppossed to write about what thoughts come to mind. but I guess those were what came to mind. hmmm. i'm tired. yes, I hope I'm able to get more sleep tonight than I did last night. maybe I'll get motivated and get all my work done before. oh. 0 o'clock?  probably not. but I'll get to sleep in friday and this weekend. I had better get motivated today. yeah, I guess after this I will begin studying and then go out for a jog. I always feel better after I excercise. and excercise is something I really need right now. there's just not enough hours in the day, you know?  I'm taking 00 hours and 0 of the five courses involve a lot of reading. the other two involve a lot of ananlytical thinking -- something I don't enjoy a whole lot. well, not at all, actually. ok, times up. twenty minutes. wow -- that went by more quickly than I thought it would. and check out my HUGE run-on paragraph!  I hate those. oh well. 
__label__label0 I'm feeling tired because I just ate and I'm concerned about finishing my chemistry homework for tomorrow. I need to go through two more chapters today and then review all six of them by Thursday for the test. I've fallen behind because I was unable to get anything done last weekend because I went back home to LOCNAME. I also didn't get anything done yesterday because I again I had to go back to LOCNAME for the funeral of one of my friends from high school that got killed. He was driving to LOCNAME to meet his roommate and had to swerve to miss a deer. It was pretty sad considering he had most of his life in front of him. His car flipped three times and he was crushed. I found out yesterday at the service that he had a rosary in his pocket when he died. interesting. I just noticed that the ORGNAME won there ninth game in a row. I'm thinking about going to medical school after I got my degree in Architectural Engineering. I want to be a psychiatrist if I don't continue my study of Architectural Enginnering. I've got myself listed as being in pre-med. It so happens that 00 of my 00 hours also count towards the completion of pre-med. That was one of the best things that happened when I went to Freshman Orientation in the summer. When I went to see my advisor, she reentered my registration code and it will allow me to register for non-engineering required pre-med classes like biology, etc. Chemistry is pretty easy right now, it's just that we are going at a really fast pace. I hope that he (Dr. PROPNAME) slows down pretty soon. At this rate, we will be through with the book a month early. He's already covered six chapters in two-and-half weeks. One of the other classes (the one with my roommate) is still on Chapter 0. I wonder what I'm going to do for dinner tonight. My roommate and I were trying to decide earlier if we should go out or if we should just make sandwiches in the dorm. At any rate, we both have homework and studying to do, so when and if we go it will probably be late. It doesn't really matter when we go since we don't have to get up early for class tomorrow. The only day I have to get up early is on Tuesday. I have a Geology for Engineers lab at 0AM. It's an easy lab, but the Geology for Engineers class itself looks difficult. I really like everyday except Tuesday because I can stay up late and study, or go out and not have to worry about getting enough sleep. It fits my schedule perfectly. I notice that my time is almost up. I have another one of these to do tomorrow. I should have got started sooner. I missed lunch today because I didn't get back into town until it was too late. After I got in, my roommate and I went to go workout. Sunday is usually our off day, but we decided to go max-out on the bench press. We usually go workout everyday except Sunday. Our dorm is located in a really good spot. We are right between the Stadium and PROPNAME PROPNAME here at LOCNAME. It sure does make for a long walk to some of my classes though. Oh well, time's up.       
__label__label0 I am so tired right now that I don't want t go to class right now but instead just go to sleep in my nice and cozy bed. I wonder if this one girl likes me and it is driving me crazy because it is affecting my thoughts. I wish it would get cooler here; It is so hot and dry outside. I wonder if I have any other homework to do tonight because I want to just relax and play some basketball. My friend has just gotten on I'M and I want to talk to her but I hafta do this assignment instead. I just thought of something funny that happened in psychology class. I think I could have broken that lie detector test easy and in the mean time made people laugh too. Hmmm. I am getting hungry right now and now my roomate has just came in and keeps asking me what I am doing and now I can't concentrate anymore. I really enjoy watching PROPNAME PROPNAME play basketball and I want to get that video that is out on his greatest moments. Dang, my room is messsy I really need to clean it up, oh well. I wonder if the ORGNAME music awards are going to be any good tonight. sounds like it would be interesting for a big get together with friends and stuff. I just got out of my english class and that was so freaking boring and not worth my time. Well, I am running out of stuff taht I am thinking of. now I am hungry again. I am so hungry but the thought of eating jester food makes me think of really disgusting thoughts and many trips to the bathroom. That is why the bathrooms never smell good because the entire floor is doing the big number 0 all day long. Ok, now our hall is noisy becuase the cleaning lady is vacuuming and is getting really annoying. Well my 00 minutes are up and I am going to take a nap now.  
__label__label0 My thoughts are all jumbled right now. My life is so different now than it was 0 months ago. I had no idea that leaving home and beginning a life on my own would change me so much. For years now, I've anticipated this change in my life. I've so wanted to be on my own. not because there's anything wrong with my life at home, but because I've always been an independent person. i've always felt I needed to do things for myself. take care of myself. not be such a burden. Today. tons of things have gone through my mind. Most of the day. it has been sleep. I love Saturdays. i love to sleep and not have to worry about getting up to do anything. But. at times. i think about home. the things I'm missing. and the things they're missing about me. I think about my little brother. and how I'm missing him grow up. I know I've only been gone for three weeks, but he has changed in my eyes so much in those three weeks. I think about the birthdays I'm missing because I just can't make it home every weekend. And I think about my friends. my best friend, Amber. how I miss talking to her about EVERYTHING. How I wish she were here to experience all the stuff that I'm experiencing right now. I think a lot about my "boyfriend". i put it in quotes because we're not exclusive anymore. we're "dating other people". i think about how much I miss him. his eyes. his laugh. his attention. But today when I woke up, the first thoughts that came to my head was. PROPNAME, you have two papers to write for Psychology. better get it done. PROPNAME, you have to mail you're grandmother a birthday card. you're going to miss her birthday this year. PROPNAME, you have to mail your paycheck home so Mom can deposit it for you. PROPNAME, you have no money left from that paycheck. so STOP SPENDING. Life is so different for me now. i've got so much to think about everyday. like I haven't done laundry in a week and a half. and I'm running out of clothes. i have to get that done too. At times, I miss having my mom there to remind me of everything. to tell me to do stuff. but at times, I don't miss that. i'm glad I'm getting things done without having to be told. I think about other stuff too. like. where am I going to live next year?. am I going to be friends with the same people?  I've been so lucky up to this point. i've got the greatest friends. they'd do anything for me and each other. I love them. and I've only known them for three weeks. I've got to think about work too. how different it is from work at home. how there are just those days when I just don't want to go. and how I'm so glad that I get a break today and don't have to go in. Don't get me wrong. i love my job. it's just. i feel overwhelmed at times. My friends are going this way. and that way. and none of them have jobs. when I'm working almost every weeknight. Sometimes I feel deprived. of there time. of my own time. but then I remember that I am now a responsible adult. and I am doing things for myself. I have to find a church down here in LOCNAME, too. I've never had the experience of doing that before. i've always been a member of the same church. always been around the same people. coming from a small town, that happens. But God is a big part of my life. and I've got to find a church. i worry about that a lot. It's something new for me. and I'm scared. Right now. i'm thinking about how cold it is in this stupid room. and how it didn't do me any good to shave my legs. oh, and how cold it's going to be this winter. so glad I bought a down comforter. Well. that's about all I'm thinking about lately. so I guess this brings my paper to an end. Thanks for listening. 
__label__label1 Writing about what I am thinking will be a new experience for me. I just got back from psychology class, so naturally I am thinking about psychology. The way I learn is that I review everything said in class in my mind for at least 00 minutes after class. Now that I am doing the writing assignment I have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. I honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. PROPNAME, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. Trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. I listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. It makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. I cannot study at home because I have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  I also cannot study at libraries because I am a people watcher. I like to just sit and watch people. I learn a lot about people that I don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. I also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when I get a really bad one. I think I have almost overcome them, but I do have one right now. all I have to say about it is AGHHHHHHHH. My mind almost automatically switches to thinking about PROPNAME when I have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and I love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and I just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. I think the only reason that I went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. I guess I didn't have very much self esteme when I met him, but now I do, and now I realize how bad he was for me. Alright, it think that my 00 minutes are almost up, so I am going to go eat something and get ready for water polo practice. adios. 
__label__label1 I figured that I would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but I now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. I think about all that I have to do, assignments in school mostly, but I am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. I suppose I'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. Then there's that person I mentioned. I am confused about a certain guy that I really like. Sounds so tyipical, right? I will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. I am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that I have met at ORGNAME t. They are so interested in having a good time, all the time. Drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. I ate lunch with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. I don't drink, because of the law (I'm 00), and I don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the Bible says. Life seems so messed up. I'm not depressed about it, but I am bothered by what I see in the world. I feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and I know where it is coming from. It started with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. God has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless God sends revival, things will continue to get worse. Also, I have been reading about the PROPNAME administration in a book entitled Unlimited Acess, and I think, "If this is what our president is getting away with who CAN we trust?!" Of course, I don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. God is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of His people. Some day, all of this--including the computer that I'm typing on---will burn up. God will come back to gather His elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. God's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. He doesn't have to save anyone. We all deserve damnation because of our sin. We sinned in PROPNAME. But in God's incredible mercy and love he sent PROPNAME as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, that I might be found among those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. I struggle with the same problems that everyone does. But I keep coming back to the cross and pleading the blood of PROPNAME. I have no inate merit. My righteousness are as filthy rags. It is insane to think that one can somehow work their way into heaven. The Bible says "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy He has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. " PROPNAME is our only way to the Father. Not our pitiful attempts to earn our salvation. PROPNAME said, "I am the Way the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me. " You have to come to God (it is clearly taught in the Bible), but you can't unless God makes you come(also a clear teaching. "No man comes to Me except the Father drag him. ") That leaves you in a particularly strange situation. You have to come, but you can't. I pray about that one a lot. Well, those really are the things I think about. I'm a Christian, and I live in constant awareness of my Creator. 
__label__label1 stream of consciousness, I don't even know how to spell the word, god my roommate is so retarded. she is so fat. if I get fat because of all the junk food ill be real angry. god I can't type. this is so retarded. I really like the song. damn I have to go to the bath room and its only been like 0 minutes porbaqbly less, there I dammit go again, can't type. uggghhh the stupid computer guy didnt call back about my computer, stupid flirt  oh yeah he can flirt and try and act all cool with me and my roommate but can't even get my computer back before my assignment is due. I hate using other peoples computers it just doenst feel the same and I really don't like typing on lap tops. I like my computer, it feel comfortable, I feel so weird at my own personal computer in college doing college stuff. although I am reall glad I don't have to write any papers. I'm pretty damn good at writting but I hate the effort that you have to put into it. my papers have to be perfect, each word percisely chosen, but then that is the point of most papers I mean all the really good writters specifically choose they're words to convey a point. I really have to go to the bathroom, but my god damn roommate has a guy over and the bathroom is right next to her room, I mean how akward is that. I have a problem going when its just girls. I have a dg meeting no a retreat at five 00 can't wait I really am beginnig to like being a dg although I don't know where ill get the money to pay for this but I worry about that later, I always get around things that I want, although I didnt get into the sor that I wanted I mean out of 0 I didn't get either, I just didnt realize how incredibly hard is is to get into the good ones, I just wish I knew why I was rejected at some of them. and I am really really bothered by the fact that this is so final I mean for life, I can't go back and try to fix things or change things. that's what's really bothering me, I can't seem to be in charge. I really wanted to be on crew really bad, I looks so fun and I love water, but the practices are so early I mean 0 and 0 in the morning, that's like the middle of the night for me. I got home at 0 and would have only got 0 hours of sleep if I wanted to go to try outs, and since I can't go to the practice tomarrow I am pretty sure thqat I can't do it, there's always next year, I guess its all for the best, I mean I will have a chance to get my footing and get adjusted, I don't want to be to heavily involved my first semester and being in a sorority takes up so much of my time. god I just really want to meet some hot guy and make really close friends, I know I'm supposed to give it time but I have been so severly disappointed since I have been here. I didnt get the chance I wanted to be in the in the really cool top sors and live-- had to go to the bathroom much better. I guess I'm happy I mean I just have such high expectations for myself, ilways want to appear to very cool to everyone else, I guess other's opinions really do matter and I know that isn't what is going to make me happy yes like with jas. jazz I really fucked up that one, all I could think was will I be cooll with this guy next year, not if I was happy or if I liked him as a person and when I realized what he meant to me it was too late. and then there's also the fact that after we got in that little fight I cuouldnt do anything about it. just wait for him to call or not call, I couldnt fix it. even after I went down there I wanted to make him see I was sorry and that I could be and was everything he wanted. I can get so messed up sometimes. I don't give people a chance because I don't perceive them as what other's would perceive as cool soes that make sense well to me it does. why am I so obsessed with society standards, I guess that 's I why I have never really be that happy or had a really super good best friend. to worried about what other people will think or say when they see me. I want to be proud like all the other girls and I don't see why they get to have everything. I mean they can be cold hearted bitches an dback stabbers, everything bad, but they'll have popularity, hot guys tons of people dying to be their friends, but me typically very nive and loyal doesn't ever get any of that, or maybe I do but just not they way I want. I always want what other people have or I can't get. more writting but I kkinda ran out of topics running why do I have to run so much and eat so little I'm mean I have a serious problem with wieght gain, I can't loose the pounds and I seriously feel like cruying because my legs are so thick. I mean I work out and I'm trying to more and have seriously cut back on my this song sucks how much longer, I guess its ok I don't want to take off my ursuline ring its part of who I am, I think its cute that I still wear it. i had a good time at ursuline it was only this summer that I got dicked over. I don't know what the deal is with andrea but the has some serious issues, she needs to grow up or get a life. I mean she just takes me for granted so much and now she's doing it to my roommate and I don't like it, I thought for once I would be able to get heroutof my life but it doesn't look that way, its like she doenst respect my friendship at all, she really doenst respect anyone, she is a conceited spoiled brat. I need to brush my teeth oh hey look I'm done  
__label__label1 How strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. The only sounds I hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. I hope I am not making too much noise. I don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. I can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. I wonder if my friend has arrived at PROPNAME and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. HOw much time has passed. Oh I still have four more minutes. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? I think he is working. Should I go out with my friends tonight? No I'm going to stay home and read tonight. I miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. I wonder if my friends miss me as much as I miss them? Life in LOCNAME is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. I think I'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that I have been accustomed to all my years living in LOCNAME. I had a routine in LOCNAME, which can not exist here. 
__label__label0 Ok, 00 minutes. To start off, I should probably write a little longer than 00 minutes. If I only write for 00 minutes, you're not going to get very much. That's because my typing skills are way below even pitiful, much less below average. The reason for that is that I'm twice as old as most of the rest of the students in this class, and consequently did not grow up using a computer as they did. As a matter of fact, there weren't any computers at all in my high school. The only computers that the entire school district had were the ones that counted holes in punch cards. I took all my first standardized tests by punching holes in cards. Those were probably the only computers in the entire city. Wait, that's not true; some of the most advanced computers in the entire world were probably there. I grew up in LOCNAME, which is where the ORGNAME plant is located. ORGNAME(although they'll never admit it, it's common knowledge) is the final assembly point for all the nuclear weapons for the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Just a wild guess, but they probably had some pretty cool computers out there. What else? oh, I hope I can just write this here and hit submit, because being technostupid, I don't have a clue as to how to do any of that cutandpaste black magic. As a precautionary measure, I'm going to print it up. If it doesn't go through, I'll have to paper your office with printed copies and bother you with emails. OK, how long has it been? 00 minutes. My guess is that after 00 minutes, most of those folks will have come up with with 00 times what I have here. I hear them over in the computer center at the UGL with their flying fingers. Damned showoffs. But enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Never mind. Bad joke The next thing that pops up sort of relates to that first stuff. What in the hell is an old fart like me doing in a university in the first place? Well, I really, really screwed it up the first time. I couldn't be bothered to go to class back then; I had dope to deal. Well, it was the early 00s, there was a lot of that going on. So when I got fed up and pissed off in the job I had, I decided to look for a new job. Being tired of the whole restaurant business, I looked through the entire classified section, only to find that everyone wanted you to have a degree. It didn't have to have anything to do with what they did, they just wanted you to have one. The ad that tore it for me was for some retail place in the mall, I can't even remember which one, listed only 0 qualifications: a college degree, and the ability to lift 00 pounds. @#%$&&^%! So here I am. Now it's 00 minutes. See what I mean? I just did a quick division since that last timecheck and using the number of lines, it comes to about 0000 words a minute. I'm surprised the keyboard's not smoking. I'll go on for a couple of minutes more here. You probably haven't had nearly enough boring stuff to read today. Now I'm stretching to find things to say. Was that the point of this deal? To prove that more than 00 minutes of sustained thought was too much to sustain? If so I've more than proved the point here. Even 00(well, getting close to 00 now) has proved to be a stretch. Enough. I'm sending this thing. I hope you get it. 
__label__label0 Just got home in LOCNAME. It's a 0 and a half hour drive. Thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. I pulled to the side and got out of the car. She got out too and I looked at my bumper just a few scratches. I let her go. I am in a hurry! I have a doctors appointment at 0pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 0pm. there goes my afternoon! This is been a busy week and a depressing one. I knew I was going to see PROPNAME at the ORGNAME meeting but somehow I knew even though I didn't want to see her. I still ended up saying hi to her. What is wrong with me!?!?! I should have just skipped it. I should have also not forced PROPNAME to go into the CSA meeting room. I think she got a little mad at me. I didn't really care. She said she saw PROPNAME and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. She is afraid that he would say something to PROPNAME or PROPNAME or those dumb losers. Even though they were my high school friends, I still think PROPNAME has changed. Well people change. What can I say? I changed for the worst. Does anyone change for the best???? Sometimes I wish I would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. But I end up making the bad ones that I am regretting. Oh well. my friend PROPNAME is messaging me again on I'M maybe it's time to go. Mom is coughing I hope she is ok. She said she is sick because of the car accident. I wonder how bad it was. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to LOCNAME. You see another bad choice of mine. What can I say!?!?!. I am speechless really want to change radically. Stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present??? 
__label__label1 so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. I wonder if I should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 0 or 0 A's. I could be one of those A's. but what if I'm one of those C's that she says are "solid writers"?? wish I was a good writer. after I read must read chemistry and psychology if I don't start soon I'll never start. and lord knows if I get behind in any of my classes, I'll never catch up again. I'm glad that I bought the notes today for chemistry. now I know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 0:00pm I can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. I'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. I've gained so much weight already. I wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. I bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. I'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. I should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes I just eat because there's nothing to do not because I'm hungry. I know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although I'm skinny, I'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. I know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says I'm everything anyone could ever want but I have so many flaws. for instance, I have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. I hate being late. that's probably why I'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks I'm a nerd but I just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. I like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. I always try to get ahead. that's why I'm always so stressed out. sometimes I wish I was not such a worry wart. I want to be laid back, really I do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. I tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should I eat for dinner. it's $0. 00 chicken wing night at pluckers. I live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but I still have left overs in the fridge so I'll save myself the 0 or 0 dollars and eat in AGAIN. I wish I was rich. I wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. I remember the day when it used to be like that. but I'm glad I ran away. I'm with PROPNAME now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 00 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 0 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. I think I'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. I guess that's it. I enjoyed this project! 
__label__label1 Well today I feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. Like today I had to do this writing assignment to get it out ORGNAME the way and do my math homework. By the way, I have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. Anyways this weekend was pretty fun since I went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. I am a transfer student and I really miss ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (the college I went to last year). At ORGNAME you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Today I have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first Monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on Mondays. Next week will be my first week to start work so I am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest I am going to get with school and work. It is my first job so I don't know how I am going to deal with it. Well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time I don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally I am not a real psychology fan. I mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. I believe that God does everything for a reason so why question what God has done he knows everything. Don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. For example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. Well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. Also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. Another example is that I still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the Discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all I know. There are other terms that I am not to familiar with also and I hope I understand them better soon before the test. I really want to get good grades this semester so I don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I really don't know that many people here, but I have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to University life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. Well I think that is about all I have to say today, hopefully I will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses. 
__label__label1 I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 00 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 0 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. 
__label__label0 I am very excited right now, because in a couple of hours I will be on a plane to LOCNAME LOCNAME to visit my boyfriend, but I am also a little anxious because lately we have been fighting more than usual, so I am not sure what will happen this weekend. I just hope everything goes well. I just talked to my friends that live there; I am very excited to see them as well. They are planning a lot of things to do with me this weekend; it's going to be fun. I am also a little worried because I am going to miss my lasses tomorrow, but I am a good student so I hope to catch up soon. I missed classes the day before yesterday too, and I bout some gifts for my little sisters. I miss them a lot. I have five siblings, one brother who is the eldest, and 0 sisters, one older than myself, the other three younger. My older sister and I both study at LOCNAME, my brother studies law in LOCNAME, where my family lives. This is my third semester here. The first that semester I was here, I was very sad and depressed. I missed all my family very much, and felt so alone, because my sister had her own friends and I knew no body in this city, but then I got used to it, and now I love PROPNAME, I couldn't wait to get back from my summer vacation, even though I had a wonderful time in LOCNAME. I worked this summer in the finance department of the LOCNAME LOCNAME, and it was great. I also took a correspondence course from ORGNAME and did very well on it. But the best part of the summer was definitely going out with my friends. I went out almost every night, it was the best. I am not really sure what I was supposed to do with this paper, or if it's going to be right, I am just righting everything that I can think of. I really like this class. I have so much fun in it; the professor makes the class interesting and fun, something very hard to do with such a large class. I usually try to avoid large classes as much as possible, but I am glad that I got a chance to be in this one. Well, time is about up. I am a really slow typist, because I only type with one finger, so this might seem shorter than the other. I really have to start typing like a normal person with two hands, but what can I do, right? Well, I'm going to return to my packing, I've got to get up early tomorrow. See you next class. 
__label__label0 I am the egg man whoo I am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and I could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what I was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, I was ashamed. as if I had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. I'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. I am positive God has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. I mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or God? so my friend and I are walking in a park and I said, "wow what pink skies, I am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, I mean its all celestial, you know all of it ""hey, want me to burst your bubble,?" she says. "I know I'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!," I said. "its because of pollution. the gases in the air. " and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. I wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. "no" I said. "that's not true," I rebutted. "because if you look at the painters of 00th century romanticism, you notice the Delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or ORGNAME's exaggerated oranges and stuff "she didn't know what I meant, and I don't think I was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, I guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. I think that if she, my friend, would have told PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME that same monstrous factoid she had told me, I could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn Beatles tune. 
__label__label1 This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor PROPNAME was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, "How the hell am I going to get home now?". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, "It's lovely weather we are having today", kind of person. 
__label__label0 I am thinking about the video game I just tried to order over the phone. It angers me that it is sold out. I am now thinking about this assignment. It comes to me that I would very much like to make a superb grade in all my classes. I think that perhaps I shall if I apply myself. I am glad to think that I can do well in school. My thoughts now focus around a girl in my philosophy class who has the cutest face I think I've ever seen. I am trying to figure out a way to talk to her. I think it will have to be classrelated. There are two other girls in that class that I think are attractive. The class itself is very fun as well. I have a lot of work to do this weekend. I suppose I should get straight to it when I get home from class today. Damn, I have to work out. I used to dislike working out because of the physical discomfort, but now it's merely an issue of time. Time is the one commodity I am exceedingly greedy with. I am now thinking about how to best manage my time this weekend. I am more or less caught up in this psychology class; I now have more time to work on the others. I think I will get caught up on reading in English, and then turn in my paper. I paused for a moment there in my writing. I was thinking about what it was I was going to do today in the gym. I realized it was leg day. Leg day is excruciating, but short. Oh well, I will live. My thoughts wander back to women. I would very much like to get better acquainted with all kinds of women on a casual level. I need to expand my pool of female friends. Even as we speak, a plan of action comes to mind. School makes it easy to meet new people. I simply have to turn off my shyness. I paused AGAIN in my writing. I was thinking about the study section in computer science I was about to go to today. The LOCNAME in that study section speaks very poor English. I will go because I understand the code he puts on the board enough that I am well ahead of his thinking during that hour. The other students are not so fortunate. I figure that they'll survive. The class is a breeze. It is not very challenging, unfortunately, but I am learning a bit. "Easy Learning I call it. " Ack, the image of a naked female just popped into my head out of nowhere. Why did that happen? Sometimes chaotic thoughts pop out of nowhere for me. At any rate, I am now thinking about what I should eat before class. Cereal. When in doubt, you cannot go wrong with cereal. Hmm, still struggling to get that nude image out of my head. I don't need distractions right now. I need a clear, controlled mind. I am thinking of how much I have in my bank account and how I will manage my finances this month. I am somewhat poor. This will change when I graduate, but for the meantime. poverty. I'd like to think that I can be rich one day. I can see myself driving nice cars, living in a nice place, and wearing nice clothes. I can see myself managing my own time, and I can see myself being satisfied as far as that goes. Money isn't so important to me, but freedom of time is, and the only way I can see myself having free time is being wealthy. Oh well. C'est la Vie. It seems my time is about up, but my closing thoughts dwell on responsibility and what it is I plan to do in school. 
__label__label1 As I start my third semester at LOCNAME, I feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. First of all, I'm excited because this is probably the first semester that I feel truly comfortable with my life here. I am living with my sister which is so good for me. We get along really well and I really enjoy spending as much time with her as I can. Also, my exboyfriend is at LOCNAME with me now. He is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. But fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. It enabled me to find out who I was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at LOCNAME. Because of our time apart, I made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. So, this year, I not only have him with me, but I also have all the friends that I made last year so that I don't depend only on him. My best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. Her boyfriend came to LOCNAME this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at UT meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. She spent most of her time in LOCNAME visiting him. As a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. Although, I know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, I realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. Since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, I fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. She barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. But I try to hold this against her because I know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. But other than that, I'm really happy with my social situation right now. It is a really good thing that I have this support of all my friends at this time, because I realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. I am taking 0 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. Three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. Two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. In the first week, I already am swamped. Although I know myself well enough to know that I will definitely finish all my projects, somehow I still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters I will have to pull (especially when I think of the fact that I have 0:00 classes every day of the week!). And I would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that I will have to build because I know how expensive they get. But, I realize that with the huge load I have so far, working is almost impossible for me. If I could have my way though, I would work at a restaurant in town. I worked at ORGNAME's over the summer and I really loved waiting tables. I met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. I think the reason I loved it so much was definitely because of all the people I met. There were mostly guys that I worked with and they were all so friendly to me. We would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. I got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. It was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. It gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself. 
__label__label1 "Stream of consciousness" my brain is thinking. I am asked to write a short page analysis of this theme, a stream of consciousness. At least I am choosing to analyze this theme and expound upon it. To begin, I first want to break down what a "stream of consciousness" literally means. The first word stream could be defined as something(water, words, life) flowing in a forward motion. The word consciousness is the state of being conscious rather than unconscious, which is what you are when you sleep. When we go to class, drive our cars, and talk to friends we are of a conscious mind at least we hope so. Our conscious mind is active. We are aware and responsible for our actions. The opposite of the conscious mind is the unconscious mind. People use their unconscious mind when they are in a deep sleep or are in a coma, also termed as unconscious. A good example of being in an unconscious state of mind and not knowing or meaning your physical actions is sleep walking. While being in an unconscious state of mind people mysteriously jump out of bed, sprint outside, and run into oncoming traffic. The next day they have no recollection of the whole incident. So a stream of consciousness could describe your life when you are awake. We are in a constant, flowing forward stream of consciousness. We cannot reverse the hands of time and swim against the current. Our actions and words while we are awake shape our stream, our stream of consciousness. Our stream is filled with rocks, sharp turns, and one day we will fall off the waterfall at the end of our stream. 
__label__label0 I'm thinking this is a different assignment and that it is going to be hard to just let thoughts come in naturally, since I am used to having a specific reason for writing. I always shake my leg. Yes, I do it all the time, like it is a nervous reaction. I think I am tense to often, always worrying about what I need to be doing or what I should be doing. I am trying to relax right now so that I am not tense. Stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes, Health Promotions, (eeh. my leg is shaking again!) Nutrition and Psychology. These classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter. I don't know why I kept avoiding this assignment. I have been putting it off. I think I feel incompetent when it comes to writing. It's not something I would consider myself skilled at. Yes, writing intimidates me. I shouldn't think that I am so inferior. I bet ya'll don't even read these. hmm I wonder if you will read that sentence. Maybe, maybe not. Should I be using proper grammar and punctuation because I really like to go like this yeah I do it all the time when I am conversing over the Internet. The Internet. I'm suspicious of the Internet. It can't be all that good. I spend way too much time online. Just another distraction in this world that leads people away from the important things in life. I cannot possibly write all that I am thinking about, because random thoughts float in and out of my head and I can't type them all. And I forget them by the time I finished what I was typing. Ok. six minutes. I'm suppose to be natural. I don't think I am. I wonder if I should stay on subjects longer, because I really want to. I don't like all this jumping around. I think the main thing is that it has to be continuous. Well, that is easy. I'm always thinking. I think too much sometimes, if that's possible. You know what's been on my mind? I just got back from this scholarship dinner. I have no idea how I got that scholarship. I think they mixed up my name with someone else. I just seemed way under qualified compared to all the other recipients. WOW! There are some amazing people here. Some incredible smart and talented people, and I need to stop feeling inferior to them, because I have my good points also, and I am a very happy person. I'm content with my life. I wonder how many people really are struggling here. Everyone seems like they are just fine and dandy, but you know some people are really sad. People can hide their emotions easily. I doubt thought that a third of the people in my psychology class are depressed. If that is true, than that is very sad. I will admit it; I am cynical of depression. Yeah, sure everything is biological and you can trace it back to that and call it a disease, but really, your mind. that's where you control it. I keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous impact. Do we not have control over our mind? That should be the one thing we do have control over, and that is where the power is. Is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind? I think not. I guess that I'm not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good. close enough to perfect for me. I am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with. I had a good child hood, good parents. No worries really. But, it is not like I've never been depressed. I spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed, but now I look back and understand why I felt that way and how silly it was, and I don't plan on doing that again. I guess, you just have to live and learn. I mean it's ok to do what's wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it's wrong and fix it. Ok. what was that all about? I ramble so much. It's hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it's in 00 places at once. I'm tired. I really am. I always feel a little tired. I had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school. It was horrible, and ever since then I get tired easily. Maybe it's all in my head and I can convince myself that I'm not tired. I should try this. It could be very beneficial. I am already starting to procrastinate. Why? Why is procrastination and epidemic among youth? Hey, I think time is up. I could go on for hours, but I really should get to my other homework. or not. 
__label__label1 Okay, I am starting to write for this assignment. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write, but I guess it's sort of like a journal and I'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking. I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. It is so big here, and it's kind scary. I'm used to knowing everyone around, but here I don't know anyone. Friends is on right now. It's pretty funny. I miss being in LOCNAME where everything is normal. I'm not used to the times shows come on here. This sounds really stupid, like I am just rambling on about nothing. Friends is funny. Am I doing this right? I don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. I miss PROPNAME, the guy I am dating from LOCNAME. I don't really want anything serious with him, but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do. Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot, or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. I don't know I am not sure. And then there is my exboyfriend PROPNAME. I don't want to be with him, but sometimes I miss him. I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that. I also don't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. What if I totally regret it in the future, and I want him back, but he doesn't want me. That would be horrible. I don't know. I'm just pretty confused right now. I don't know what I want about anything. It's hard getting used to everything around here. I miss the show 00000. I was just thinking about it for some weird reason. That used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. I'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I don't know if I'm going to go or not. My roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. She's the same major as me. She's a pretty good influence on me. She gets me to go to meetings and stuff that I probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. I am filming the volley ball game on Saturday for a live broadcast. I'm glad I am getting involved somehow. I tried to get tickets to the OU game, but I couldn't they were already sold out when I was supposed to get them. I'm pretty bored right now. I probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since I'm free writing, I don't think it really matters. At least I hope it doesn't matter. I'm a little scared about grades. I hope tests and stuff are not too hard. I'm not really thinking about anything right now, so I have nothing to right except that I have nothing in my head. This is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. I'm glad it rained today, it was nice. I love the rain. Ever since I was a life guard I have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. Everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, I guess I'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. Okay, well my time is up. 
__label__label0 I have no idea how to start this, so I'm just going to start typing and discover what happens!. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend, PROPNAME. I miss him a lot, a whole lot. We've just been going out for 0 months last Saturday, but it feels like we've been together forever. I can't imagine my life right now without him. He still lives at home, near LOCNAME, and I don't get to see him as often as I would like, but if it's meant to be it will be. It will be hard, definitely, but it should be worth it. He tells me all the time how he loves me, and how he will marry me. He even asked me last week, well not officially, but he did ask me what I would say if he asked me to marry him right then. I had no clue what to say I was really confused. I'm so unsure of what to do. I miss him so much it's unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I had stayed home to go to college because it's going to be so hard for the next 0 years, maybe 0. All of my friends love him and his friends love me, it's almost too perfect, if that is possible. His parents are my parents and his brother and I have become very close and get along great. I can imagine having them as inlaws. I was always brought up knowing that you never get along with your inlaws, but I don't see how that could happen. This weekend my roommate and I are going home. We've grown up together. I've known her since the second grade and we've been close friends since seventh. I'm glad that I know her. I don't see how people can come to a place like this and get a roommate they've never met before. That would have added a lot of stress to my life. Not like I don't already have enough stress. Actually, college hasn't been as stressful as I imagined it to be. However, I'm sure that will all change as soon as we start having exams and finals. ugh. I'm not looking forward to that! I've always been the kind of person to put more stress in my life than is needed. A couple of my friends pick on me saying I "freak out too easily". But it doesn't feel like it to me. I don't know, maybe they're right! I was raised an only child, until recently. My mother and biological father divorced when I was four and my mom remarried the man I call dad when I was six. My stepfather has 0 sons and one daughter (who is my age). But, they never lived with us they would spend the occasional weekend at our house but not very often was it longer than a weekend. My entire life changed about 0 months ago when my stepbrother PROPNAME moved in. He took over my life. It was crazy. Suddenly he had all of the attention. I know I sound like a jealous brat, but really he did. Not even just from my parents, suddenly he was my boyfriend's best friend. I could not get away from him. I have worked for my dad's company for 0 years, and then all of a sudden he started working there too. My entire life changed in the past 0 months. I gained a brother, left home for college, lost some friends by leaving, gained some friends by coming, and I am now living a totally different lifestyle. 
__label__label1 A writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as I sit here I can remember all the papers that I have written. I usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what I have written before I continue. I can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. Right now I'm thinking about where I need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. I wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. I looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. Today is in fact my second day ORGNAME school at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. Now, I'm more worried that I won't be able to succeed like I did in high school. Maybe I'm not so worried that I won't do well; I'm worried that it will be very hard and that I won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. Today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. Well, I'm not a chemistry major, but I am a biochemistry major, so now I'm worried that I'm in the wrong class. I've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure I'm eligible for the class, and it appears that I am. Maybe I just shouldn't worry. I also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. I'm basically a good student, and I usually don't disrupt the class. Sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. I guess its not really a big deal, but I don't like getting in trouble. I'm one of those people who likes to do things I'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once I suspect that someone might find out, I'll try to get everyone else to stop. I know it is kind of hypocritical, but I just don't like to get in trouble. The words I dreaded most growing up were "LOCNAME, we need to talk. " Whenever my mother said that to me, I just knew I had to be in trouble. I would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what I did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. Usually, it turned out to be nothing. I guess sometimes I worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. About a month before going to college, I spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. I guess I wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but I was crying about everything. It even made me upset that I didn't have my computer yet, and I wasn't leaving for college for another month. I just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how I wanted it to. Plus I had a lot of things to do in August, and I didn't want to run out of time. It did work out, but I still became upset about it. I moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. For the past couple of years, I've told everyone that I want to be a doctor. Now I'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. I can't even begin to imagine the debt that I will incur by trying to become a doctor. That made me want to look into other careers, but I don't like a lot of other things. Maybe I can wait until I graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. I like to worry about everything. What I really like to do though, is to make lists. I love buying planners because I always write down my assignments. And I write what I have to do on Thursday and if I don't finish that day, I write it again on Friday to make sure I do it. I'm not that concerned if I don't complete my tasks, but I just want to make a list. My roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. I have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? Plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and I want to have music playing. It wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. I understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. I guess I'm just used to studying if I need to in order to do well. I just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time. 
__label__label1 Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for ORGNAME ORGNAME and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named PROPNAME. She went to ORGNAME. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of PROPNAME. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. PROPNAME makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the LOCNAME LOCNAME has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. 
__label__label0 Okay. So I need to write what's on my mind. Right now all I can think of is that chemistry test I just took at 0:00am this morning. It was my first test in college I was scared as hell before I took it because I was scared I would run into problems I didn't know how to workout and I would not pass the test. Now I'm sitting in anxiety for the results. I keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm trying almost anything I can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. Goodness I feel so behind in my classes and I don't know why I mean I have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and I got time to relax, but can't. Again that stupid test is on my mind. Why does it torture me so? I'm sitting here praying I will get an 'A' on it because I gave it the best shot I could have even if I had studied continuously the whole week, I wouldn't have been able to do better. I guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. The entire thing was a review for me from chemistry II my junior year. My stomach is in huge knots and I feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and I don't like it. Those warning signs usually mean I'm in trouble for something, but I don't know why yet why I could be in trouble. I hate not knowing things. It makes me feel so vulnerable and I hate being put on a spot like that. My gosh I hope I didn't fail the test, otherwise I'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. I just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. I wish I could relax right now. Maybe I'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as I'm through typing this assignment I still have 0 more minutes according to the clock. Man, I really hope I run into PROPNAME today again that boy is really cute! But one thing puzzles me does PROPNAME like me? He always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us BULL CRAP THEY WILL! I think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. Man! that test, but it's not that anymore I feel like I'm in trouble and I don't know why is everything okay at home? I sure do hope so. Why do I concern my self so much everything will be okay no? Hey! need to write my cousins I really don't feel like writing PROPNAME now, I'll write him over the weekend when I go home. Man I've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 00 minutes are over I hope this assignment is long enough I don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind I've never done that I've always had to think what I write and it's terrifying because any minute I feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and I'll get a zero. 
__label__label1 Right now I have a serious feeling of relief. It is the night after my first day of college, and it feels nice to be home. My legs are tired. I miss my dog and my boyfriend. I wonder what he is doing right now. I hope I am doing this right. I guess there is no right or wrong when it comes to my thought process. I guess it just happens the way it wants to. I hope that I can get back into the whole school "flow" again. I hope that I can get into it enough that I can get into the business school. I can feel you laughing at me already. Everyone seems to think that I can't do it. I know I can. I will. My mind is blank. I am so worn out. I haven't walked so much in one day than I did this afternoon. I hope I am not sore tomorrow. I need to find out where I need to go in the morning. What time do I have to wake up? My class is at nine thirty. Great! Why hasn't my boyfriend called me? He was supposed to an hour ago. Wonderful! Oh, I have to call my mom. I wrote a check today that I have to tell her about. How much was that thing? That reminds me. I have to set up Telesys tomorrow. Just one more thing to add stress to my day. I should work on my typing. What is that noise? I need to take a shower. Maybe I will wait until morning. I should call all my friends back home to give them my new house number. I wonder how college life is going for them. LOCNAME started late this year. Thank God! I don't feel rested, still. What time is it? Five minutes to go. I feel like my mind is blank. Whenever I try to "hear" what I am thinking, the only thing I end up thinking about is trying to think. That made absolutely no sense. I'm hungry. I really need to be more open. I've gone all day without meeting anyone new. I need to work on that. Oh, time's up. 
__label__label1 hello, here I am trying to figure out what to write for this 'assignment'. Well, let's see, I believe I have a CS quiz in a couple of hours, I should get studying for that. Yeah, that what I'm thinking. I need some print outs for that though. Boy, I wish I could study at my job, this way I wouldn't have had to wake up early in order to study over the quiz material. Oh well, what can one do. My jobs pretty good by the way, its new and the stuff is either easy, or once where I learn. Hence, I have fun. I haven't chatted on MIRC for a long while. Maybe I'll do that at work, it should be fun. Hmmm, I'm just thinking like random thoughts, about nothing specific. My gyming is going fine, hope I get a good looking chest/body over the next month or so, not that I need to show it off or something, just because this way the clothes i wear will I guess look better on me. Anyway, so how much time is up, I think about 00'ish minutes, I need to drink something dude, maybe milk. But nothing is OPEN! well it is like 0am too. I guess people don't have quizzes that have to prepare for. I think I'm going to go to my job kind of early and print out some slides for the CS class quiz it should be easy. and about this whole Coop thing I think I should go check out the companies but not really apply apply I don't want to as yet I think I can make my GPA higher and then apply what do you say well I can't there's no one really who might be able to help me out I just have to think about myself. but CoOp fairs are a great time you get to get all dressed up at stuff but in this HEAT!? hmmmmmmmmm I don't think that would be a good idea. anyway I believe my 00 minutes should be over by now so I'm going to take off. 
__label__label0 I'm writing my first college paper I guess you could call it a paper no offense off course it is a relief from some of the reports I wrote in high school I'm already missing high school a little bit but I wouldn't give up the fun I'm having now for anything especially my home town LOCNAME anyways its 0:00 and guess ill quit writing about 0:00 the music I'm listening to is way too loud but for some reason it helps my feelings just flow onto the paper better if I keep going at this pace this paper could be very long its 0:00 now whoa I've all ready thought of a lot of things right now I'm at study hours for my frat phi kappa sci baby yeah woo hoo that has been an experience I've never met some any people so fast in my life it makes college life like twice as fun and I would recommend a frat to any guy its not just the drinking either which is what everybody seems to think speaking of drinking my court appointment has even been made for my contributing but I can't get into that because my mom said so I actually talk to my parents a lot more than I thought I would my mom is still doing my laundry that is a sweet deal I'm not going to mess up my dad is pissed because he doesn't think I'm taking enough responsibility or something like that the little paper clip dude with eyes is kind of freaking me out right about now he keeps giving me these weird looks there are a bunch of weird people here at LOCNAME it doesn't seem fair for me to be so quick to judge but I can't help it the other day I saw a guy and a girl walking and holding hands and as I crossed the street I saw that it was actually two chicks I know that being prejudice or something but it took me by surprise my roommates mom just called me and I'm talking to her now and my mind is wandering and I'm done talking to her now and I'm supposed to give my roommate a message but I've forgot already because I was to busy typing anyways its 0:00 and this is a little harder than I thought it would be I don't think I usually think about things for 00 min strait hey there's a first time for everything I just looked around my dorm room for something to think about so I could let my feelings flow on to the page but I'm drawing a blank I think that phone call messed up my train of thought anyways I can't believe how early I have to get up tomorrow I have to get up at 0:00 an tonight I'm supposed to stay out late and there's a pretty good chance that I will come home stumbling and laughing uncontrollably is that a word it probably is but I misspelled it or something five min left and I've got my first grade in psy000 sweet deal thong thong thong whoa sorry got into the music for a second its still to lo. whoa my next door neighbor just banged on the wall how freaky is that I should turn it down now. actually I'm going to turn it up hahaha sweet I'm so freaking mean anyways 0 min left and these last min are taking a lifetime whoa the paperclip just winked at me and I think he's smiling I'm really hungry but I don't know what to eat peanut butter sandwich ramen fishes crack. whoa my roommate just turned on limp as loud as he possible can sweet losing my sight losing my mind wish somebody. all right 0:00 uno minuto mas I was Spanish for tres years in Spanish and you've already heard like 00 percent of my Spanish vocabulary the clock just hit 0:00 
__label__label0 okay. here's the thing. I'm not writing this on my word processor but I do want it to be a stream of consciousness so I'm not going to worry about punctuation, spelling, or capitalization. so here goes. I'm not even exactly sure what to write about but I'll just go with something. Ummm last night I went out and had a kind of interesting night I went over to my old friend carlo's house where he was having a party although me and my friend laura prefer to think of it as lar's house because carlo has been hating us for some while. actually not for some while, ever since he went to LOCNAME. so I went last night because I really wanted to tell him not to hate me anymore and we talked for awhile about what was wrong, basically he says he feels like he has tried so hard with me and I always put him on the bottom of my list and now I'm off in boyfriend land and don't even care to make time for him. which sucks because I seem to get that from a lot of people and I think that I really make excuses about it to myself because it seems to me that everyone has just assumed that boyfriend land whatever that is is where I want to be so they just kind of cut me off without even asking me what I really want or feel. so then I kind of go off to boyfriend land because I feel like he's the only one who ever wants to hang out with me anymore even though it sucks when he is the only one I am hanging out with anymore because too much time with any one person really sucks. it also sucks when I go to a party and people are always asking me, "where's your boyfriend?" like I'm not allowed to go out without my boyfriend or we are weird because we don't always want to go to parties together but I'm glad that eric wasn't there last night because I don't think that carlo would've talked to me about all the stuff that he did. also eric says that he doesn't even like going to parties with me anymore because I'm such a damn flirt. which I guess I am but I don't really think that I am whenever he's around. if that makes it any better. I wonder where jamie is right now. that is one of those things she probably told me so I probably should know. I feel like I'm writing in a diary right now and that is very weird for me since I haven't written in a diary since oh maybe middle school and even then it was just retarded writing saying things like oh my god! I danced with dj at a the dance! or more often someone in my group of friends is fighting because it seems that is all we ever did. I wonder if that was the group that I hung out with back then or if it was just our age and immaturity. oh well. anyway back to jamie. where is she? I don't know but I sure wish that I was working with her tonight the night goes by so much faster whenever she is there I swear. maybe it is because I'm antisocial I don't know. what sucks is that we got tickets to go see kenny chesney (the hottest country singer ever! as long as he keeps his hat on though he's kind of bald and if he wears his little black shirt because that is always a plus too) anyway we got tickets to see kenny chesney and now because of her stupid sorority that she doesn't even like or want to be in but has to stay in because she lives in the damn house she can't go. which pisses me off. I don't even want to go if she's not going annoying but I really do because it is after all kenny chesney I just don't really want to go with the people that we bought tickets with because I don't really know them even though we work with them. I don't really know oh well my time is up and I've got to go call laura anyway. you know I thought that I would be able to type a whole lot more than this in twenty minutes. oh well. 
__label__label0 At the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how I will make it through college if I remain a procrastinator. Thus, I am completing this assignment because I feel that I need to make changes in my study habits. Moreover, I need to succeed at UT because I cannot afford to let my parents down. My parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if I fail in college. Thus, failing is not possible. Occasionally, I ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. At times, I feel, as though, I am a failure because I am constantly being compared to my older brother. Everything that I do is not good enough and that I should be more like my brother; I guess one could say that I am always in my brother's shadow. Moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. Because they do this, I constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. In order to cope with this, I am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. Each of these "flings" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. However, I am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because I know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. Not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. There is one thing good that has come of these experiences; I believe that I have found happiness with another. She makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who I am and not someone else. When I am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. Surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; I guess you can say she's my soul mate, but there is one thing I am sure of, I love her with all my heart. In fact, she has been the only girl I have actually told that I love her and actually meant it. Just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile. 
__label__label1 How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average PROPNAME. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the "s" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 00 minutes. 
__label__label0 I just got back from math class, and surprisingly, I feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 0 weeks. Or I should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. But anyway, I'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. I like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining/comical, unlike my economics class. I dread that class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I would not be surprised if I fell asleep in that class today. But there is one advantage to going to economics LOCNAME, or should I say PROPNAME. I got to stop calling her LOCNAME. I wonder if she gets offended. I hope she knows that I mean well, and besides, she's so cool. Not to mention, fine as all hell. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight, I hope I see PROPNAME. Woooooohh deeee! She is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl I have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. And yes, I am keeping PROPNAME in mind. PROPNAME would be a close second. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing, I miss her. I should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 0 WEEKS AGO! That's alright, I can just come up with another excuse, like always. That could be the problem with me. I just put things off and blame it on laziness. But I don't want to go into that right now, because I would need 00 different 00 min writing sessions. That sucks that I was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because I was about to be on fire. I wonder how many words per minute I've been typing. Pretty good, I'm sure. It's surprising that I haven't mentioned PROPNAME, or PROPNAME I don't give an F about those guys anymore, and I wouldn't be one bit discouraged if I never saw them again. You better believe that. I could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. Anyways, I believe that it will catch up to them someday, and I'm going to let Nature take it's course. I know for a fact that PROPNAME doesn't have anything going for him, I mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from Subway! Not to knock Subway, but I would expect more out of him, or maybe not. Dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. PROPNAME, I hate to admit, is smart, for now. But oh yeah, it'll catch up. All those drugs are going to bake his head, I can already see it happening. Sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. Usually, I would wish for their wellbeing, but I have been through far too much. Right now, I seem malicious towards them, but in 0 weeks, I'm sure I just won't care. Has it been 00 minutes, because it feels like about 0 hours. I'm going to check the time, I know, I know, that's cheating, but I HAVE TO! Here I go. I'm back, I've got 0 minutes left. So, there's this kid I used to know from middle school, his name is PROPNAME. He's Iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. I'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. He's got PINK hair for crying out loud! And I think he's the only kid that I have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. I think it suits him, and suits him well. I'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. He actually told me that I used to look more Iranian in middle school, which I think is just crazy. I would say it's the other way around. Basically, he's really cool, and I wish him well. I just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. It's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. Alarm? Oh yeah! I guess I didn't have to check half way through. I don't think I can stop typing, it's like I'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and I really like it. It's like I can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. However, feedback would be so beneficial. I'm going to force myself to stop right now. 
__label__label1 I completely forgot that I had a discussion group for Philosophy today at 00, so I went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to LOCNAME, one to LOCNAME, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the LOCNAME LOCNAME people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. 
__label__label1 This semester should be one where I define the rest of my life. Working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. It is what I have wanted to do for the past 0 years. The fact that I was initially rejected brought me down. But I can't let that hold me down. Hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. My roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. I'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. I have known him for the past 0 years. I am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. I don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. I am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. Hopefully something will come of it. If not there are about 00,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. I thought this was going to be easy but so far I just can't seem to talk about much. That it was I hate about myself is that I am too shy around people I don't know. People I don know think I am loud and very extroverted but around strangers I don't know how to initiate conversation. There are times though when I don't really care and I seem to make friends with everyone. I have a lot of reading to do but I thought I might as well get this out of the way. I used to do this type of thing in my 00th grade English classes. Mr. PROPNAME was so cool. My old high school wasn't very good. I guess that is why I only went there for 0 years. I bet there are about 0 million mistakes in this paper once I am done typing this. The psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. That is such a relief because I need to work as hard as I ever had in my entire life and I probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. I think that after this semester of busting my ass I t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 0. 0 over the next years will come natural. I believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. Architecture is a field of tremendous work. I have worked with a guy for the past two years. It so good. I have learned more on the job than I think I will ever learn in any classroom. It was a job I was looking forward to going to every morning. He gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. I was able to organize the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME fundraiser where I happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. How much longer do I need to type? This is lasting longer than I thought it would. I guess my head is just empty. I think while doing this I try to hard to put on this thing that I think you want to hear. But since it is just a free thought paper I should just be able to write whatever I want. But for some reason it just isn't happening. I think way too much about things that keep me up at night. I often lie in bed until 0 in the morning just thinking I will be in the next 00 years. I have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. I think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. Just once to here my dad say, "that's my son" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what I have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully I went let him down that is why I come to class. That is why I have to college. This is why I am reading and turning this assignment in days early. I will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. If I don't I have not only let myself down but my parents as well. But I won't let that happen. This is the place an time to make or break my future and I don't plan I on coming away from the university with anything less then I what I came here for. I will be the best and I will make my parents proud. Time is almost up I thin. I guess this has been good for me. Even though no one will probably ever read this I know it has been a vent. These are things no one has ever heard me say. So take car of it. Times up teach, talk to you later. 
__label__label0 I have to go to the SI unit and then the Crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet PROPNAME and LOCNAME for dinner. I should have some time tonight to do homework. I'm still tired from last night, maybe I can take a nap sometime today. Otherwise, I can always sleep in tomorrow. Having only afternoon classes will be interesting. My lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. It's such a difference from the chem labs. I'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. I hope my physics lab is easy as well. One can only hope. Not having lab the first week is nice. It worked out well so I could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. It's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. I'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. I hope that's not an indication ORGNAME how much she cares about the renters. At least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 00 years that knows everything about this place. It's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. I think it's fate we moved in here. After all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. I still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. I can't forget to meet PROPNAME at 00am on Monday in the ORGNAME to work on physics homework. It's 0 pages long. I hope it's as easy as the first homework. It still took a while to finish though. From 0pm to 0am. This time I'll start earlier. I'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. I have a lot of reading to do and 0 tests to study for. I need to start seriously studying the PCAT. I can't believe I almost missed the deadline on that again. This is ridiculous. I hope I get into ORGNAME ORGNAME. That's the only place I'd really like to go. Except maybe ORGNAME or ORGNAME of ORGNAME. ORGNAME is probably too expensive. I'd want to live in LOCNAME LOCNAME when I have money so really I only want to got o Pharmacy school in LOCNAME or LOCNAME. The only thing about LOCNAME is I hope PROPNAME has gotten cleaner. I know she never cooks anymore, so probably. We'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and I might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. That's going to be expensive. I hope whatever happens, Mom and Dad aren't disappointed in me. They need a web page for ORGNAME so I know when I need to get in line and for what. The draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information I need either. Maybe next year I won't buy either. It's so much of a pain. I don't even feel like going. I bet that's how they make their money. I don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. I know they were trying to improve that, I wonder if that went through. Probably not. As a whole, LOCNAME just cares about money and not the poor students. That's why alumni get everything. Good luck to the "sick" staff. 
__label__label0 Okay, I'm starting. I did assignments like this in freshman English back in high school. It was pretty cool. Mrs. PROPNAME was a great English teacher, but she scared me sometimes, like when she would yell at one of the kids in class to prove a point about what we were learning in class. I really liked that class. I liked the books we read. We were reading PROPNAME PROPNAME, and one of her points she made was over censorship, she took the book away from us. We couldn't even go to the school library to finish it. I guess she got her point across. Another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment, you can get it done. Before we read Animal Farm, she split us up into groups, sheep, pigs, dogs, chicken, and we had to have a campaign. This just wasn't any campaign, we really had to work for it. Make up slogans, flyers, songs, costumes, bribes. you name, we were graded on it. We were allowed to decorate all the halls with our flyers. It became really big, Mrs. PROPNAME and her campaigns. It just kept getting bigger every year. I guess you could say the incoming freshman were getting crazier each year. I didn't really care, each year that went by was closer to me getting away from there. I can't stand it back home. I knew everybody in my school, and they all knew me, so tell my how I ended up with only a handful of people who would talk with me during lunch. I wasn't rude to people. least I don't think I was. Oh, well, I'll never see most of those people again in my life. Yippee! No, that's not the least bit sarcastic. I think sarcasm is a certain type of humor. Only certain people can do it, and only certain people think it's funny. I had to deal with sarcasm all the time in my family. I don't understand how some people say they come from a broken family. Your family doesn't necessarily have to be split up to feel like you've come from a dysfunctional family. I have to live with what my father does, and so does my mom and brother. Big deal, we make it through one day at a time. Like today, I just stopped worrying and went to a concert. It was pretty cool, although I wish I'd gone with someone who wanted to go up into the mosh pits. I know they're dangerous, but, come one, they're fun and you get to get close to the bands. I also went to a concert on Friday night. That one was cooler. The lead band was so cool. The singer was dancing around stage so crazily. It was a really neat experience for me. Only seven more minutes to go. No, I'm not counting. There goes that sarcasm again. Once, for junior English, my teacher had us try what PROPNAME PROPNAME did to better himself, keep a record of all our vises and try to improve upon them. Guess which one was my weak point? Yep, sarcasm and meanness. I can't help it, it's in my nature. I'm not a mean person, I just see things sometimes in a mean way. And you have to voice it, otherwise it just stays inside and festers and then you do become mean. Right? At least that's my superstition. I don't normally go in for superstitions, but this one sounds good for me. Oh, and I say 'Bless you' when someone sneezes, I think it's just polite, I don't believe in the scaring the demons away. I think that's a bunch of bullshit. Man, I can't wait to graduate. I really want to fly helicopters. That's what I'm going to do when I get out of college. Go into the ORGNAME and fly helicopters. It should be really neat. I know neat isn't quite the word I'm looking for, but somehow, I don't think awesome would be appropriate in a paper I'm turning in for a grade, even though you're not going to read it. 
__label__label0 I'm sitting here wondering why he doesn't take a better interest in me. I'm wondering if he has started to see this girl PROPNAME. Am I pitying myself or am I really this strange? Do I actually think that he could love me? Maybe he does, but it's been only a week and he hasn't spoken to me like he used to. I love him so much, God. Why has he changed? Or have I changed? It's been one week though! One week! My heart hurts so much, Lord. Please help me. I feel so helpless, so caught up in something that seems so ridiculous. I love him madly yet he treats me with such irreverence and formality. Then again, maybe it's all in my head, as always. That night in front of his yard. It was wonderful. His eyes. His lips. His smile. The sincerity poured from every valve. I cannot bear to think of him with someone else. I scream with pain at the very thought and I wonder why. Why does this have to happen? Why did I have to fall in love with someone who would fall in love with someone else? I can't stand this. I have to do my schoolwork tomorrow and I don't think I can concentrate. I'm dying. My brain is itching and I'm scraping at the walls to get out of something I am not even in. I hate this city. I hate it here. Why am I even here? I look outside at the night sky and see nothing. I look outside and I can't remember who I used to be. I can't remember what made me happy. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. I look at the street and I can't remember the last time I smiled. It was today, I know. but not the last time I felt it. My heart feels empty. My mind is gone. My eyes are filled with tears and I cannot bear to fathom his leaving me. He is everything. There is no one else. Nor will there ever be. I miss beyond words and I cry almost every night. WHAT HAS HE DONE? WHAT HAS HE DONE? Most likely nothing. Maybe I'm being over dramatic. Maybe I'm not being practical. But it hurts. I saw them, God. I saw them together. He likes her, I can see it. I stood like a fool and watched them. I STOOD LIKE A FOOL. I'm so scared. I'm sitting here in my own selfpity crying my eyes out and wondering why. MY laundry is almost done. It's 00:00. Why, God? Can't I keep him? I miss him. I'm not happy here. I will never be happy again, I fear. Not truly happy. I am not complete without him. I'm crying loudly. I fear the neighboring people will hear. But what does it matter? What could they do? I'm hurt. Embarrassment is nothing. Love is nothing. only once. This must be it. I believe a person only falls once. madly and once. I was so wrong to believe that I was not in love with him. I was so wrong to have said and done all those things. God, help me. I will die like this. God, please help me. It hurts so much. I cannot bear to think that he could love someone else. Not after all that time. Not after everything. Why does he throw it away? Why can't he love me? Simply because I am not there? BULL! That's not true. I still love him. I cry. I miss him. I write tot him. What does he do? He comforts me with lackluster professions of love. Maybe I'm making a mistake again. I used to be so sure of everything. I used to be so sure of what he felt. Now I feel and know nothing. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of writing for this assignment. It's much too private and it's so hard to determine the stream of consciousness. It is filled with idle, petty things. with no purpose. It floats from one island of topic to another without care and without remorse. I hear screams in the other room. I wonder what is happening. Is she excited or raving? I hope she isn't hurting. Because I am and I fear I cannot take it. I won't kill myself. But I do wonder how long I can survive. I've never believed that I could live to see past 00. maybe even 00. I'm so tired. I want to go home. I didn't before but now I do. I wonder if it is because I want to lure him into staying beside me. to keep him near. tightening the leash. God, help me please. Give me some sort of sign. An epiphany. something. It hurts so much to remember. I'd rather not think about it. It's 00:00. He'll be calling in an hour. if he cares. If he wants to tell me that it's over. I'm so hollow. Maybe this is my punishment. Maybe this I what I get for having been so cruel and unloving. Now I love and the tables have turned. the eye has changed visions and my life has become worthless. This is what you get rings through my ears. I'm sick. I only want peace. I want a comforting arm. I want a hug. I want a kiss. I want love. I'm so terrified of losing him by losing myself. I cannot change because then he will not love me. I'm not even sure if I am doing this correctly. I'm doing this in a form of a prayer rather than what I'm thinking directly. Either way, it's something. Oh, Art. Please, say something I need to hear. I myself do not know what it is. but I need you to say it. Maybe I secretly want you to tell me it's over so that I can find another person to fill the void. But whom could possible begin to? No one. You were the one. You are the only. You always will be. Ten years from now when I watch you get married I will still love you as strongly. There is no better person. Your soul is so true and so lovely. so pure and untouched. I was lucky enough to glimpse that. I was lucky enough to love you. Thank you God. Forgive me, please. I should have loved you better. I'm staring at your painting and I can't help but wonder why I screwed it up again. Why am I self destructive. I need you. I need you to hug me. To kiss me. To tell me that you want me. Please. Please please please. I'm so weak. I'm so pointless. This is purposeless. Help me, God. My back aches. My eyes ache. My feet ache. My life is gone. Music could soothe me before. now nothing does. Not friends, not family, not anything. I wish I could figure out who I am. or be told who I am. I cannot figure it out. Please God let him love me. I'm terrified of what I will become without him. Oh God, please hurry. Please send me something. I need a drink. I wish I hadn't done so many things. I wonder who is online. who could make me feel better? PROPNAME? Does he love me? I don't love him. Although I wish he loved me. Why am I so selfish? Why can't I be good and whole? What did I do that was so wrong? So many things. Please help me. It's 00:00. I'm done. 
__label__label0 This is beyond weird! I never thought that college could be so exciting and scary at the same time. It is so weird how my thoughts have progressed through these two weeks of college. I never thought that things would be this independent. I am finally away from my mother and father who always told me what to do since I was a tiny little ballerina princess. No more telling me what to do or when to get back. And yet the weirdest thing about all this is the fact that I feel no urge to go out and party on sixth street. I guess all that time my parents were telling me what to do and when, was all taken into consideration when I moved up here. In changing the subject, I just came down with a throat infection and it is the worst ever. I told my parents that I had to get my tonsils taken out a long time ago but they never listened to me. It is not fair. I had the worst night's sleep last night and to top it all off, I have to catch up on all my class readings which means no catching up on sleep. I am such an observer when it comes to just walking down the street or on my way to classes. It is so funny how people I know act in a bizarre way around others compared to how they act in front of me. The other day I caught myself looking at a little boy no older than seven years old, and he caught my eye because he was on top of his dad's shoulders doing the "hook 'em horns" sign with his tiny little fingers. It was the cutest thing because it reminded me of when I used to get on top of my father's shoulders and do the exact same thing. In a blink of an eye though, it all seems but a distant memory. It is so weird how I always dreamed of going off away from my LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME life and coming to live my life far away from all the kind of people I could not stand. Do not get me wrong, I loved my family and "real" friends, but there was just something about that town and how everything ran on the game of politics. It was all about what kind of car you drove, where your family came from, how they were connected to some of the richest people in town, and so on. It all meant nothing to me in the end because the way I saw it was soon I was getting out of there with some place to go where people did not care about things like that. I accomplished everything I wanted in high school. The highlights were getting head drum major two years in a row and winning homecoming queen and getting to conduct in my white gown in front of my band, my family, and in front of everyone in LOCNAME! It was an awesome day. The best days were when we would attempt to study for an extremely hard economics test by going over to someone's house and actually doing no studying at all. Those were the best because even though we saw each other in class, it was just on a 'hi' and 'bye' basis. When we got together, we would get each other caught up on the latest gossip and laugh about the stupidest things all the way into the night. Somehow, we all managed to pass the test the next day and we all felt better knowing that we had connected the previous night. Talking about people in our school was the main thing because our school was made up of all kinds of want tobe's, gangsters, stupid people who actually fooled everyone into thinking they were smart, and so on. Unless you were in band or on a varsity team, the people you hung out with were not at all your friends. It was the best feeling knowing that so many friends were there at band practice everyday and tennis as well. I would have to say the only thing really excellent about my old school were the faculty. My band directors were my closest friends and still are to this day as well as my tennis coaches. They always went above and beyond the call of duty to try and help with whatever I needed. Now that I am gone, I guess it is time for them to help raise another bunch of good students and friends. I feel really good leaving that small town, not knowing what to expect out here in LOCNAME. My morals and ideas my parents, friends, and teachers taught me through the years will always remain a part of me no matter where I go! 
__label__label0 I love college. Although it is very hard work at times, you learn a lot about yourself and other people. I enjoy being in LOCNAME, although my family lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. This is my second year hear and so far I like how things are going. Of course there is always bumps on the road, but you learn to get by. Sometimes I miss being home with family and friends, especially because my best friend lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We've been the best of friends for nine years now. It seems like a long time. I have so many memories and I like to dwell in them from time to time. My dog ran away. I just felt like adding that in. I just came home from work and found one of my fish dead in the tank. I don't know what happened, the other two are fine. I just got these goldfish. I guess I bought them because I miss my fish back home. I have six huge goldfish back home. They have been part of our family for almost six years now. They are getting pretty old. One of them is blind, I think, because he keeps bumping in to the aquarium's glass wall. I am enjoying all my classes so far. Let's see if I feel that way once testing time comes around. I am a bio major. I love biology. I think it is one of the most interesting subjects around. It is so complex and always changing. I want to go to medical school after I obtain my bio degree. I am kind of worried that I won't be accepted to any medical school. What will I do with a biology degree? I like to do research, so maybe I'll do that. I have done research in diabetes in the past. My grandmother has diabetes. I believe that is one of the reasons that I want to do research on diabetes. She lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. It is such a beautiful country and they have the most amazing beaches. I visited my grandmother this past summer. I spend a month there. This country is developing so fast; I didn't even recognize the colony I grew up in. Of course there are still some underdeveloped sections, but it seems like it's becoming more industrialized every time I visit. Ok, back to medical school. Being a doctor is what I have always wanted to be. Sometimes I think that there is nothing else I can do. I can't wait to go to medical school and actually work in hospitals. I went to a medical profession high school. We were able to work at different hospitals. We had a fist hand look at part of the medical field. I even got to help in various procedures like suturing, administering medication, giving vaccines. What I enjoyed the most was working in the ER. Sometimes it is very slow, but there are times when patients are coming in left and right. I was able to help bag a patient who had just had a cardiac infarction. It became pretty stressful at times. Afterwards you get a great feeling of satisfaction. I t is a feeling that you have helped someone in a time where they needed help the most. You can never forget that feeling and that is why becoming a doctor is one of the most important things in my life. Besides my spiritual life, a relationship with God, and my family and friends, that feeling you get when you help a person in a crucial point is the thing I want the most. 
__label__label1 right now I'm thinking about how I don't want to do this I just want to get to new mexico and start hunting. this is the fifteenth year me and my dad have been doing this. it all started when I was 0 I can remember my first time of course I didn't shoot anything that year just kind of watched but it was still fun. I'm also excited that my best bud justin gets to go with us I met him at church camp my freshman year of high school. he's not from kerrville he's from boerne but after that first year we were always kicking it together every weekend. we have had some fun times parties, going wakeboarding at the lake, snow skiing, spring break at south padre. its all good. well back to hunting now, its a good drive and here I am stuck doing my homework instead of driving in the car, I wish I had a lap top then I could do this while I was driving. I almost got one, but my dad changed his mind and got me the box. I'm not complaining because I have a burner and did and its real fast and all but a lap top just seems more versatile. dang how long is twenty minutes. when your sleeping twenty minutes goes by SO FAST but when your doing homework or sitting in some boring class, IT TAKES FOREVER. funny how that works. any way I wish the twenty minutes was over and it almost is just a few more minutes left. at least this was an easy assignment, not some hardcore 000000 page essay you wanted typed out single spaced font size of 0. I have to do one of those for English and I haven't even thought about. I'm a procrastinator it will probably be the night before and I hadn't even started on it, oh man I just got a big time hunger for ice cream, chocolate ice cream that is. after this maybe ill go get some, I hope you don't take off for grammar or are expecting proper English in this thought page. because I'm just writing what comes to me and my thoughts move faster than I write so its kind of hard because I have so many thoughts yet my hands can only go so fast. dang there are a lot of hot chicks at LOCNAME I'm glad that me and the girl I was dating from home decided to date other people before we went away to school, because I would be a bad boy and want to mess around on her, but I'm not like that, I have real guilty conscience. any way back to those hot chick, dang so many girls and only 0 years of college to get to know them all. I hope I can fit them all in to my busy schedule, you right like they would give me the time of day well actually a real hot chick asked me the time but that's about all she would give me dang like I said twenty minutes is a long time and the clock is going very slowly I swear it hasn't moved since I started. now I'm thinking about "what's going through my mind what can I type to take up space maybe I should just start typing long words but then I wouldn't spell them right so its no use. any way back to school and back to this 00 minute writing assignment. I don't know what to right, I'm drawing a blank, dang its like my mind is running black. well now I'm worried about not having enough crap packed. I can't wait to go to new mexico, its my favorite trip of the year, its all I can think about right now because I'm leaving right after I finish this. only a few more minutes. I'm going home and I can't wait to see my dog. of all the people at my house to miss, I can't wait to see my dog, he probably doesn't care but oh well, I can't wait to see him. 
__label__label1 The ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is amazing. I love the fact that I'm living independently in my dorm. I have high expectations for myself here at the university at I also fear many aspects of college life. I have to remind myself to stay focused. I'm extremely excited about the opportunities that LOCNAME has to offer, regarding education and entertainment. I'm really looking forward to the relationships I'm going to make, the parties I'm a enjoy, and best of all the memories that will be cherished. I feel so free, but nervous at the same time. I feel I can make it though. I just visited home last weekend to visit my grandfather and the rest of my family. I miss my grandfather, but he's in a better place now. I believe he's still with me in spirit and his soul is still protecting me. Death is a crazy thing. I was happy to see all my family for the labor day weekend, but it wasn't the same without my grandpa. My grandpa was like the king of my large family, so the reunion was abnormal without the him. I pray for him like I always have. My cousin's up in ATX with me. I know I'm a be partying with him a lot this semester and next semester. I felt so suppressed at home cause I had parents that tripped all the time, but I know they trip as much as other parents. I'm enjoying everything at this university. I'm just inhaling everything and it's great. Classes are huge, people are diverse, it's just a crazy experience. I'm half way done with this assignment. I miss some things about my hometown, I miss my mom and the rest of my family, but I miss my girlfriend like Crazy! She's so amazing! PROPNAME dropped me off last night and we chilled in my dorm all by ourselves. We've been together for like an official month, but we've been getting to know each other for like 0 months. I'm really starting to trust her, she's really growing on me. I reminisce about my other girlfriends, and they're whack in comparison with my shorty. She seems, and I emphasize seems, so faithful to me, it's weird. Trusting girls with all your heart is hard, because tricks be scandalous sometimes. I've been played like a Sega dreamcast over and over like a broken record. I got so much battle scars and war wounds from selfish young girls, it's hard to believe I can still trust PROPNAME as much as I do. But for some reason I just do, I'm fearing what the hell she's capable of doing to me, like hurting me, and that's why I don't act faithful sometimes. I've been good, but I guess I'm just scared to be alone, so I just stay somewhat close to other women. Because if she messes up and does me greasy, then I got some chicks that are close to me. I've never really been alone in that way. There's always some girls willing to get to know me. I've had some lonely times though everyone does. There's so much in front of me at this university, I don't know what to expect. I just have to remember to stay focused, get my priorities straight, and bust my ass to get my goals done. 
__label__label1 I am so exhausted. These last few weeks since school has started has worn me out. I have pretty much no energy, and I got ten hours of sleep last night. My brain is also exhausted from all the partying I have been doing since I got here. I can't wait for tonight. I am going to club Elements, and I am going be wasted. I love techno music. It is so awesome. It is crazy how a DJ can put all sorts of different beats together at once and make it sound so perfect. I could listen to techno music all day long. I am listening to techno music right now. Every time I hear techno music it makes me want to dance and have a good time. Anyways, I hope LOCNAME kicks some ass on Saturday. I love watching ORGNAME play football and tear it up. College football is the best sport in the world to watch. My other favorite team to watch in college is LOCNAME. My dad went there so I have been a true LOCNAME fan ever since I was little. I even went to the Rose Bowl in 0000 when they played LOCNAME LOCNAME. They won and LOCNAME ended the season undefeated and number one in the nation. In choosing the college that I wanted to go to, it was a choice between LOCNAME and ORGNAME. My brother graduated from ORGNAME a few years ago and I really looked up to him greatly as a kid. I finally decided to follow my brother and go to UT. So far I feel it was a great choice. Austin is an awesome city that fits well with my personality. I decided that if I want to continue my studies and get a masters degree, then I will probably go to LOCNAME for that. Right now, that is my plan for the next seven or eight years of my life. However, I really don't know what exactly I want my major to be. Anyways, off of that subject, there are so many fine girls here. Everywhere I look there is another girl that I want a piece of. I t is awesome. I have never seen so many hot chicks in my life. The whole experience of living down here so far has been awesome. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. And it is great living far away from home. Nothing beats coming in at five in the morning and not having to hear my mom or dad bitch at me. Actually, my parents were very good parents and usually let me have my space. They learned after the first two kids what it is like parenting kids, so they were pretty loose with me. I really do kind off miss my parents. They are very good people who gave me a lot during my stay at home and they would do anything for me. They have always been there for me even when I have been in trouble with authorities and other high officials. Not that I was a bad teenager or anything, but I think everyone who likes to party a lot, like me, have had their share of conflict with the cops. Anyways, twenty minutes is up, so bye. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm feeling relieved that I was able to get here  the last couple of times I tried to get to this site the computer told me the site was unavailable. Very frustrating! I like this assignment, although I'm not sure why 00 minutes are necessary; it seems to me that 00 or even 0 minutes would do. I'm really not sure what to write next  I haven't done this kind of thing since seventh grade, when I was home schooled. It's weird how your mind goes blank sometimes. I still don't know what to write. My thoughts are mostly involved with ORGNAME, with classes and so forth. I like them, in general, but only one has been intellectually stimulating so far (no, I am not going to tell you which one!) I have great hopes for the rest, though  sometimes it takes a while for a class to get into gear. Don't know what to write. Don't know what to write. Feeling frustrated, I guess. I was afraid I wouldn't think of anything to write. It's not that I have a sluggish or inactive mind  quite the opposite, actually. It's just that sometimes I don't do well when I have to write it down. Which is strange, because I love to write. I keep a journal (which you, Prof. PROPNAME, would probably find interesting) and enjoy writing in it my gripes, hopes, fears, joys and other important stuff. Maybe I'm just not good at this kind of structured work. I'm lefthanded, Prof. P  does that have anything to do with it? I have a vivid imagination, and am inclined to daydream. Hey I just remembered, you said these were confidential. I can write anything I want! I don't feel any freer with that in mind, however. I'm stuck again. Still stuck. I wonder how many of my fellow classmates have the same trouble I do with this. Stuck. Now I'm thinking of the guy I like. (I'm not going to give his name, because I'm serious about him, and I'm not sure just exactly how confidential this really is. ) I wonder if you actually read any of these, just to see what kind of people are in your class. I know that if you really picked my brain you'd have some interesting stuff (interesting in a good way, of course!) This is a tumultuous and crazy time in my life, although most people would think it tame. My beliefs are undergoing an overhaul, and everything seems to be up in the air. That's not a good feeling, but it's never dull! I think in the last few months I've learned a lot about prejudice and tolerance, and I'm glad I'm learning what I am, even if it destroys my plans for perfect happiness (sarcasm there). What kind of a world is it where people who search for truth risk having everything they want taken away? This can't be right. But it's true, and there's no denying it. This makes me feel apprehensive and sad. I feel some anger at the world, and at God too. (Yes, Prof. PROPNAME, I believe there is a God!) But real religion requires immense amounts of faith, and I have to trust that everything will end up ok. Now I feel slightly reassured. If only everything weren't so uncertain! But do I really want a world where you know exactly what's going to happen next? What if you knew when bad things were going to happen, but were powerless to prevent any of them, because everything was predestined? It's possible that everything IS predestined, but that we don't know about it. Maybe you don't admit that as a possibility, Prof. P, but I do. Anyhow, I would much rather not know what's going to happen next in most cases. But in some, like who I'm going to marry, I can barely contain my curiosity. I guess that's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life, that I so strongly feel the need for another one. But whatever happens, I refuse to worry  if everything's predestined, I can't change it anyway, and if it is, then I can still change things for the better. 
__label__label1 College presents a life that is quite different from home life! Having to adjust the many changes is both challenging and fun! Doing laundry is a task that I am almost positive that I will never become accustomed to! It is boring and time consuming! When I visit home I appreciate the clean clothes in my closet even more, since they are clean and I wasn't the one to clean them! However, the independence I now have is unexplainable. I realize that I am in control ORGNAME my life now and the direction I will go! Sure I had control of my life before college, but my parents were there to guide me and make sure I made the right decision. Now it's all up to me to make the right choices. I have to be the one to say, "I don't want to go out tonight. " And when my friends persist, I can't use the excuse, my parents won't let me, which makes it even more difficult! I know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that I will cherish forever. I am excited about my next four years here and am quite sure that with my determination and hard work, I will succeed not only at The ORGNAME of ORGNAME, but in life as well!  
__label__label1 So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. PROPNAME is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like LOCNAME and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that PROPNAME got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of LOCNAME for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word LOCNAME programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to LOCNAME next year. Not LOCNAME LOCNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the LOCNAME people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end 
__label__label1 As I walk down the middle ORGNAME campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, I feel like a star in the huge night sky. With so many stars scattered throughout the sky, I seem to go unnoticed and lost. This is a feeling that I have seldom felt. As an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen I have always been one of the brightest stars. Just a month ago, I seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. I now feel lonely and intimidated as I embark on this new phase in my life. I feel like I no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. Knowing that if I do not obtain a B in Chemistry 000, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. Can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? As I search for answers, I question whether or not I made the right decision to choose to attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, or if I'm even college material at all. What am I saying? Going to college was never an option for me. I want a good life for my family and I, and I've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. My parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. However, I could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support I have received from my family. Throughout my life, I would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. Though I regard them so highly, I also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. The transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that I have left behind were not so great. It is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because I accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. I feel that this is somewhat peculiar because I realize that even if I was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. Eventually I would be left behind. As I work to achieve and to be the best I can be, I hope that along the way I will find the happy, positive person that I once was and know I still am. 
__label__label0 My goodness. I have so much to do over the next few daysnot to mention the next semester. Wow, my first semester in college. I love this freedom. I want to go to sleep. I feel like I'm completely wasting the time and the freedom I have by sleeping through it all. My roommate is at a LOCNAME LOCNAME function right now. I'm in the sorority. I really should be there. I guess I'm a party pooper. She pissed me off a few hours ago. I really liked her, but I'm beginning to get some weird vibes from her. Someone was caught smoking weed on our floor in our dorm tonight, and the resident assistant went to talk to him about it. My roommate got really mad about it. She said, "That's so dumb. That's why those people wanted to live off campus. The RA said he was going to be lenient on that kind of thing, and now he's getting them in trouble just because someone ratted them out. " Oh well. oh God. I have to go deal with some feminine hygiene issues. Okay, I'm back. Anyway. I don't care where you live. That's still completely illegal, and people shouldn't be doing that. She was just so blasé about it. I don't drink, and I don't exactly condone that either, but smoking pot is so much worse. If people are going to do illegal things, then that really sucks. But if they're not hurting anyone besides themselves, then whatever. If that's the case, then let them do their own thing. But they absolutely do not have the right to feel victimized if they get caught. That's so immature and irresponsible. I'm listening to ORGNAME by ORGNAME right now. Wait. I have to check the spelling on "Pachelbel. " Yay. I was right. I figured I would be. not to sound cocky or anything. I just like when things are spelled correctly. oh. I have to press "repeat. " I really like this song a lot. I'm getting more and more into this classical music thing. My parents, or my mom really. my dad's not really concerned with me very much. my mom raised me to be pretty cultured. I love music and the arts. So anyway. I love this song. The string quartet played it as the wedding march at my mom and my stepdad's wedding when I was only eight years old. I was the maid of honor. Goofy. This song reminds me of one of the instrumental pieces from the little mermaid. the part in the movie where Prince PROPNAME is escorting the human PROPNAME around his town. The instrumental piece is playing when they are dancing in a little square and he lifts her up just as the music climaxes. Oh. it's so beautiful. That part always gives me the chills. That sounds so dorky. I think it's just the combination of the beautiful music and the thought that PROPNAME and PROPNAME are falling in love. Hold on. got to press "repeat" again. Sometimes this laptop really makes me mad and frustrated. The keys are so small and close together that I press the wrong one a lot. It's really annoying. I miss LOCNAME. I used to live there. I feel sick. I'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. He was smoking earlier, and I was in the same room. On top of that, I've had a cold for the past four days. I'm all stuffed up, and I have to blow my nose again. I switched to another classical cd. I especially like some of the pieces on this cd. Right now, PROPNAME's (yes, I did look at the cd to see how to spell that) "Piano Concerto in B flat minor" is playing. I really wish I knew what "in B flat minor" means. Ok. my "stream of consciousness" was interrupted. I feel really bad. My hallmate called me and I've been down in her room for the past 00 minutes. Oh. I just walked back into the room and "The Waltz of the Flowers" from the Nutcracker is playing on my "000 Masterpieces of Classical Music" cd. This is such an amazing song. I miss taking ballet classes. I really need to get back into it. I'm so out of shape. I have this yucky flab on my thighs. And I really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. I'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that I've been doing for the past three years. It's all for show. I want to go back to taking classes where I can dance for the sake of dancing, where I can appreciate the beauty of it, where I can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. I guess I'm weird. I just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music or when I'm dancing. I just have these moments where I get PROPNAME and I'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. I really miss LOCNAME a lot. And I'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. My throat hurts. I just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell "throat. " That kind of thing really scares me. I mean. We're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. I really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. It just really pisses me off. That's so analretentive of me, but it just really makes me mad. Okay. I have to do my homework for my linguistics class now. I must say that I had a really interesting time typing this assignment. I've never done anything like this before. I think it has convinced me that I need to start keeping a journal of my thoughts. 
__label__label0 It's 000 now; I feel like I'm playing who wants to be a millionaire, waiting for the time to change. Yeah. Really that's what I just said. Why is my roommate talking to me? She knows I'm doing this assignment. Ahhhhhhhh. That was really annoying, I'm not sure if I just meant my roommate or me. I sometimes think I don't know the meaning of half of what I say (even though I didn't say that) I just completely lost track of what I was writing cause she talked to me again. Blah blah blah. Why do I do that? Anyway, I want to have more dreams. Really bad. Good dreams where I don't want to wake up; like the one I had when I was little and it was so cool there were these lonely French 00 year old kids in it and I was standing outside their house window or something; they remind me of mafia and the untouchables; my secret song that I swear is about the untouchables. I wish I knew what song it was. That would be great. I wonder if I'm making too much of my friend 'coming out'. Like I'm ok with it, and most everybody is ok with it, but I might be trying to sound TOO ok with it. I don't know. My roommate's parents don't like me, I don't think. But I'm not entirely sure so I shouldn't even think that, let alone say it. Or write it. Aren't I supposed to be typing about my feelings? Ok, I feel like I keep trying to prove myself to my friend PROPNAME, just cause she is so wonderful and I don't feel too wonderful myself a lot of the time. But I don't try to prove myself to her; I did to my friend PROPNAME, but not to PROPNAME. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I hate that; I'll think something about somebody just cause I had thought it about someone else. And I don't know if that's bad or good or whatever. I'm typing too much too fast; I keep getting myself confused and backspacing. I wonder if I should just leave all the misspellings in here; it might make sense so far as the paper goes, since maybe that would suggest that my mind's confused and jumbled, the way handwriting is supposed to tell about you, but I don't know at all. Cause we're supposed to correct our misspellings. The Buddy PROPNAME song is in my head. Does that mean I should sing it to the paper since it's in my head and whatever's in my head should be going down here? No, I don't think so; it's kind of like background music; jazz to PROPNAME type of thing. I wonder if I'm as important to PROPNAME as he is to me. That goes with all my friends. He should be here soon; no tape for me. This makes no sense, I'm sure; I sound horrible, like PROPNAME PROPNAME, except for I keep criticizing myself as PROPNAME keeps complimenting myself. My back hurts; I wonder if my doctor who I went to once was right when I said I was going to have neck and back problems later, just cause I don't have the greatest posture in the world. I mean, my philosophy professor said today that if pleasure is virtue then he was virtuous in smoking, and he wasn't lying, but I don't think that there is any virtue in slouching. Is this what fist person books are supposed to be like? Cause characters would never be able to write this much; no, what I meant was that it would sound dumb and pointless and rambling like this, unless they had some superb, LOCNAME island computer guy like mind. Like that last reference wouldn't make any sense at all to anyone but me; in books they describe it. I don't know. Like PROPNAME I guess. Bless you. There, I said it in response to my roommate's sneeze on here at least. I don't think of her as PROPNAME, cause she's not, she's my roommate. PROPNAME's a dead girl who used to laugh at a camping trip where she got sick on the day of a campout; no a bonfire; who used to like peanut butter. PROPNAME did, not the peanut butter. Why is everyone homesick (or my roommate). I'm not; I want to talk to my cat though. He's going to hate me when I get home. Like, it'll be like when my mom took him into surgery and he would run away from her. I hope he doesn't die. I'm missing all of the little things in between these thoughts; the thoughts I have while I'm typing. I would try to type those things too but then there would be things while I was typing that. I hate paper, I miss trees. There goes my roommate complaining again. But I'll stop, cause she might come over and read over my shoulder or something and I'll have to stop like I did the first time I tried to do this exercise; that was horrible, it was only 0 minutes into it, but still. But she came close to here, and I don't know. Good, she's on the phone now. I'm staring at the little monitor light on my computer; it looks like some alien symbol for sex or something; I don't know what I'm thinking (tip of the tongue) but its weird whatever it is. I want to be in Rocky Horror. I wonder what it's like to be in it; just in the movie, not the little plays during it. Yesssssssss, noooooooooooo. I don't know. It's 0:00. Why the hell did I type yessssssssss? Remember on the Wonder Years, and they would have to go to typing class; that's what I think my mom's childhood was like. My lips feel like they're about to fall apart if I smile again; not because I've been smiling too much, because they're really chapped along the edges. Two minutes left. Yess. I did it again. I want to go out to breakfast; real breakfast, with eggs and pancakes you don't have to tear apart with your teeth to cut. I'm looking at my chopsticks now; I wonder why people are so fascinated with them, why I brought them, I don't know at all. And I'm feeling bad about having a goodluck elephant made out of ivory, cause doesn't that go against the good luck of elephants? 
__label__label1 My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when PROPNAME came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. PROPNAME is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the ORGNAME ORGNAME. I am already into the Pre ORGNAME ORGNAME but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die. 
__label__label1 As I sit in my dorm room at this point in my life, I can think of one thing only, sadness. Sadness because I miss my family and my boyfriend and because I feel extremely lonely at this huge school. I am overwhelmed with my thoughts and concerns. I am scared about meeting new people, scared about making good grades, and in general I'm scared about starting all over again. I know that I should be so excited that I get this opportunity to begin my life again and start new adventures, but I'm not. Last summer, for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged and I was extremely happy. Of course as soon as I obtained that wonderful feeling, it is ripped away from me at an instant. I feel like I am so stressed out here because I have so much to do at all hours of the day. I'm a very high strung person and need to relax a lot and I'm not really given that opportunity here. Joining a sorority was something I thought I had to do when I got here. So I did and I'm not sure it was the right decision for me. I think snobbery overwhelms my sorority and that bothers me a great deal. I really don't know exactly what my problem is but I just don't feel comfortable here. I am in love for the first time and the guy I love is in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We are not dating because we both agree it would be too hard but I love him so much that words could not possibly describe. It hurts to be in love and know that I will probably never be with him because of our location. I want to transfer but I I would be terrified to do that just for a guy. But when I think about it, I would do that for him. My thoughts are in a jumble right now and I feel many emotions running through my body. I'm not quite sure what I am going to do at this point in my life. My confusion, anger, and stress take over my life and it will take some time to figure out who I am and what I want with my life. 
__label__label1 Well currently I am stressed out. It is as if I have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. My academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. I am so used to being involved to the point that I came to college and repeated the same cycle. My grades reflect this. I just want to get at least a 0. 0 and go to a decent medical school. My sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. All of my friends want to become members. I am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. My line sisters reiterate to me daily that I must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. At our interests meetings we turn mean. How can I hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. I don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and I want to maintain that level of friendship. They look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. My first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. My second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. They'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. I have so much on my mind that I believe my mind is going to overload and explode. Must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time  
__label__label1 I am so stressed out right now I don't even know what to do. If it's not one thing it's another. Everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. I'm trapped. I have so much inside that I want to let out, and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself. There are just too many pressures. Sometimes I wish I could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. But it wouldn't be. Sadly, I'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who I really want to be. I wish I could just be PROPNAME all of the time. But, it's impossible. I'm always too worried about everything, but I think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. I always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. I also find it hard to express those perspectives. Most people just don't care, but I seem to fret over everything. Maybe I'm obsessive, I don't know! But to top it off, I'm pretty happy where I am today. I guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where I am today. I can't believe how some people really are. Some people I know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. They let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. I don't want to waste my lifetime like that. While I'm still young I want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that I have. I would love to contribute to the world and be the best person I can possibly be. I don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. I know the truth, and no one can judge me accept God. I want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. But the world is not that nice. It is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes I wish I didn't live in it. But the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. There's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. Sometimes I'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that I want to do. A friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. I like that advice. There's so much inside of me that I want to explode! And I wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. Well, I certainly hope not. I want to be 00 and feel like I'm still 00. A lot of times I wish I were 0 or 0 again with no worries or responsibilities. I believe being around that age was the best time of my life. I had no real care in the world. I was too confused to. I had no idea I actually existed in the outside worldI just was. Well, I could go on forever but I got things to do. I kind of like this assignment. It's neat. Well, I don't want to bore you or anything, and I think my 00 minutes is up! So, it was nice chatting with you Dr. P! 
__label__label0 I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 0 or 0 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 0, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 0. Good I have until 0 to study until people come over. 0 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. 
__label__label1 How do we know that everyone is seeing the same color. We all call colors by the same name because we are taught that as children, but do we all see the same thing? When I look at something that is red I know what I am seeing, but I have no idea what someone else is seeing. They could be seeing what I know as the color brown. I am sure that there is some piece of scientific equipment that could prove this theory wrong, but it is still an interesting concept to me. Seeing something through someone else's eyes is impossible. I have no idea how others see the world. If the color theory were right seeing something through someone else's eyes would give an entirely new aspect of things. Red trees, orange apples, the LOCNAME flag would be completely different. It is easy to say, no that's a stupid idea, but if you really think about it it is fascinating. People always use the argument that we call colors by the same name. "What color is that? Well, its brown. Well I see brown too so your theory is wrong. Not so fast. When we were learning the color names as children we all learned the same names. When someone held up a card and said, red, that is the name that you gave that color in your mind. There is no proof that everyone saw the same color. I do not think that this is actually the way that things happened, but it is interesting nonetheless. I would like to know how this theory could be proven wrong. Just like I would like to know how they can prove that certain animals are colorblind. They cannot see through that animal's eyes, how do they know what it sees. Some animals certainly are colorblind, like the deer. You can wear bright orange when you hunt deer and they do not notice, so they are obviously colorblind. Who is the first person that figured that out? They were either really stupid or really smart. I would never think about wearing bright orange to hunt an animal. I'm sure that's not the only test there is to see if an animal is colorblind. There has to be a scientific way to prove it. My 00 minutes is just about up and I have run out of things to say. This is kind of a weird assignment. It will be interesting to see what kind of application this has. I actually enjoyed writing this paper. It is a lot easier to write when there are no set guidelines. 
__label__label1 I'm really use to writing for long periods of time straight and not stop. I keep a little diary myself and write my thoughts and feelings down whenever they overwhelm me. I suppose it's some sort of stress release because I always feel better afterwards. Writing in my diary has allowed me to express my feelings and emotions onto paper. This way, it's easy for me to look at it and then maybe figure out how I am to deal with the emotions. Some things I write about are problems with my relationships with other people. One entry I wrote just recently was about a problem with this guy. There was just so much pressure on me from this guy that liked me that I couldn't really stand it anymore. He told me he liked me, and I suppose he expected me to just like him back. Don't get me wrong, he is a good friend of mine. Maybe that's why it was so hard. But anyways, I was able to express my contained feelings into my diary. It really did help a lot. When I first heard of this assignment on writing for 00 minutes straight without stopping I thought to myself "wow, this will be fun". My roommate, on the other hand groaned and said she would never be able to do something like that. She says there's just not that much to write about. I told her how she could just write bout her day or whatever. 00 minutes goes by pretty quickly if you think about it. It's already been about 0 minutes since I started. I'm typing kind of fast. I suppose it's the flow of the words. Since there's no really structure on this assignment, I can write without thinking too much. I had a pretty harsh day today. Didn't set my alarm clock, thus I woke up 00 minutes before my first class started. And my teacher Is a real stickler for this timing thing. She wants us in our seats and ready to go by the time class starts. That is usually what I would do, but today, I really couldn't do much about that. I hate walking into class late. There's only about 000 zillion people that look at you when you walk in. And you know what they're thinking, "man, SHE's late". I don't like that feeling. Well after the lecture (which I understood very well) I had to go back home because I hadn't brushed my teeth or anything yet. The whole way back I was thinking, "man. it's too early in the year to be starting this". But I got over it. Told my friends and laughed at it for a little bit. That's one of the reasons I love having my old friends here at LOCNAME. There's always someone there for you. It's like bringing a little bit of home with you. I live with one of my old friends from high school and she's an awesome roommate. Her boyfriend is also one of my good friends. And his roommate is the guy that I mentioned earlier. that likes me. Then I have many other old friends that are hear with me, and it just makes me feel more safe and comfortable. But I know I need to make other friends and I do. I like to just talk to people I don't know. You know that old rule "never talk to strangers?" Well, I don't follow that one too well. It's always nice to meet new people. They can always share new things with you that you couldn't get if you just stayed with your comfort zone. I like to venture out and make friends and do new things. People that don't like to do that, I feel, are too closed and unwilling to experiment and find out. It's scary being here. A brand new place with all these HUGE buildings towering above. Scattering around like ants looking for classes. In LOCNAME, we have big buildings and classes too, but, everything is so familiar there. I miss it, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere but here right now. I love the new atmosphere and environment UT provides. There are so many things to do. I'm enjoying it a lot. Maybe that's why I don't really feel a whole lot of stress with the new classes and deadlines and everything. I guess in happy here and that's what's most important to me. All the other things I can deal with as long as I'm feeling good. 
__label__label1 I just completed the pretesting survey. Sigh, things like that make absolutely no sense to me. I can never decide exactly where I stand, and I can never define myself with the choices provided. Always have to compromise who I am. I always end up generalizing all of those qualities I have fought tooth and nail to keep. Starting college has been such a weird experience. A room full of people, but I am still alone, a street full of people, but I am on my own, a world full of people, I have nobody but myself. I am glad the ball has started to roll. College is beginning, and, so far, there have been no horrid surprises, I have not been ambushed by a detail I have overlooked. I now have to gauge the speed of that ball, and plan my life around it. I need to visit my family this weekend. That is a drag, I am just beginning to form this new life, just starting to assemble my new identity, and I have to disassemble everything, and hide it in the closet. Family, sigh, the wonderful thing about family is you are sentenced to being around people who you probably will never get along with. Parents are even funnier. You are sentenced to respect and obey these people you probably will never get along with. I bet you are assuming I don't get along with my family, that we fight all the time. Right and wrong. I don't get along with my family, the key word is I. The person they think I am gets along with them perfectly. We haven't fought in 0 years, that was the last time I tried to be myself around them. Then I realized that I had to either bullshit them and survive, or go down in history. So here I am, Mr. PROPNAME. Sigh. Sometimes I wonder where the bullshit ends and I begin. I stopped wondering about that a while ago. It was too hard to tell. I hate every person who is in my life right now. My roommates are ok, but immature. My girlfriend, that's right, girlfriends, are not compatible with me, but I am not willing to give up having sex, to be perfectly honest with them. At least not until I can find somebody I get along with, and can have sex with. I don't know why I place so much importance in sex, but that is all I can think of when I see a slightly attractive woman. I feel so evil sometimes, but I am sure my parents would be proud. I might be a depraved heathen, but at least they taught me how to bury myself under selfguilt. Good for them. This is the end of the twenty minutes; I need to go get my laundry out of the dryer now. Until next time. Ciao. 
__label__label0 Somehow I just submitted an blank assignment so hopefully this one will submit when it is completed. I should be studying for my first astronomy test right now. Somehow I managed to put it ORGNAMEf until the last minute like I did with this writing assignment. I need to break this procrastination problem before I get any further into the semester. I have this problem every fall that I have been in college. In spring I am fine I get everything done ahead of time. I am sure it has nothing to do with fall or spring. I am hoping this fall my grades will be awesome but it is hard adjusting to a new environment. I just transferred to LOCNAME after 0 years at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME. I have been living here now for almost three weeks. I feel like I'm on vacation or something. While I miss my old apartment and friends, I am very happy to be here at LOCNAME. I couldn't get in to UT directly after high school because of my class rank. I didn't really concern myself with school in high school. Suddenly when I started at ORGNAME academics became more important to me and my grades improved. I applied to UT expecting to not get accepted because I had heard horror stories of how hard it is to transfer in. It came as a complete surprise when my parents called and told me I got a letter of acceptance. I instantly decided that I was ready for the move. It never really hit me that I was leaving my friends behind in LOCNAME until now. I think I offended one of my closest friends in LOCNAME because I was so excited about moving and didn't really seem to care that I was leaving. Suddenly two weeks before I moved she decided irrationally that she never wanted to speak to me again. Oh well. I love Austin. 
__label__label0 I'm realizing, as I begin to write this, that this psychology assignment is probably the weirdest thing I've ever had to do for a class. On one hand, it seems utterly useless, but then again, I know nothing about psychology, so I'm fascinated to find out how they can use something like this for scientific purposes. I just got my wind ensemble music about half an hour ago, and I'm already nervous. I'm also really hungry. I should be meeting PROPNAME for lunch right now in Kinsolving, but I'm doing this assignment instead. Hope she's not mad. I don't think she will be. PROPNAME wanted to eat over there anyway, and I'd like to try their food, so we'll probably go over there for lunch. Maybe not dinner. I have rehearsal tonight for ORGNAME. Dang it. The last thing I feel like doing right now is marching. It's so hot. I really miss PROPNAME. He's been on my mind every once in awhile, ever since I started school. I don't know why I think about him so much. I've tried to deal with these feelings before, and they've gotten better, but only a little bit. I think of him as a friend, but a part of me still likes him a lot. I don't know why. I should know better. He's the last person I'd ever want to date. But maybe that's why I like him so much, that whole "opposites attract" theory. I don't know. Actually, it's not that I don't want to date him, but he has so many qualities that I shouldn't like. When I think about his friendship with PROPNAME, it always stirs up jealousy inside me. I know I shouldn't get jealous of her. They were such good friends  more than friends  for awhile, and there's no reason that I should mean as much, or more, to him than she does. I should be happy for them. I love carolyn. She's one of my best friends, but at the same time, she drives me crazy. I don't think she realizes how much it hurts me when she talks about how sweet doug is to her and everything. I wish she'd just make up her mind between him and zag. But the more I think about it, the more I don't miss all that crap from high school. I know there are going to be other guys that I meet  I already have met several in ORGNAME  but it's just that I don't know anyone well yet. There's nobody that I can just talk to, or sit beside and listen to them talk, like I did with PROPNAME. I really miss those times when he'd play with my hair or hold my hand or stroke my cheek. All the times carolyn wasn't around. Weird. No, I need to stop thinking like this. What did my book say? I'm supposed to wait for God to put someone in my life. I shouldn't go chasing after guys (like PROPNAME does) because that'll only get me hurt. I try so hard to be good and do what my Christian friends say, but I guess it's that human nature that makes me want to do the other things. I'm really getting hungry now. I think she just finished her calculus, so maybe we can go eat when I'm done with this. I wonder if dad ever found my phone last night. I hope I can remember where I put it, because I really need to have it. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing with his region band music. I'm so nervous for him. I really want him to beat PROPNAME. No, I don't. I just want him to get some more confidence when he plays in front of people because he is so good. Well, pretty good, at least. If he had some attitude, or if he didn't get so nervous, he'd be awesome. I wish I could fix it for him. PROPNAME has so much confidence. Matthew needs to be more like PROPNAME. In some ways, at least. I miss me. PROPNAME, too. Sometimes this whole college thing feels temporary, like I'll go back to school in a week, and everything will be normal, and fun, and stressfree. PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME are doing a good job, but there are so many things that I wish they could do differently. Conducting bugs me the worst. Or maybe it's just the fact that they've replaced me. I'm no longer needed at ORGNAME, and that really bothers me. They might miss me, but they don't need me anymore to keep things running, and it hurts to think about that. Of course, it's kind of nice to be at the other end of the spectrum for awhile, and not know what's going on. Being a freshman is nice, to a point, but then it just drives me nuts. I wish I had a tape player so I could listen to Mr. P's tape. I can't believe wind ensemble is starting tomorrow. I wish I had my car down here with me. I feel so isolated, helpless. I'm homesick, but not really. I just miss PROPNAME, I think. I wish I could've seen him this weekend. I can't wait until I make some good friends here, but all the guys I've met so far are so immature. It's frustrating. 
__label__label1 It is 0:00 and I have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. I can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that I am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that I will only be graded for the fact that I did it and not examined for the content of my mind. Does everyone hold their mind as sacred? I can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way I guess I am somewhat obsessive/compulsive. It's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. This openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do I have to say? This 00 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who I am sometimes I think that's what life is about  everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet I wish I had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. Who doesn't want to be analyzed? Who doesn't want to analyze? I know that I am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, "voyeurs". I had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. My friends considered themselves "voyeurs" and I had to admit that I am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions I only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. It strikes me as funny that I am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that I am talking to you to the extent that I can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? I was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. I thought again about how different I feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and I feel like I've written a lot. If I were a TA I would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as I read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and I would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. But perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are "true to science" YAY! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. I am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet I cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? It has certainly given people (I've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. I don't discount science, I do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. It's a tough tough thing. Of course 00% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous I can imagine. But as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? I have been asking a lot of questions! How defining of me! Now I (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. I will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 0 minutes actually the time will be up. Well love and life and craziness and all the things I thought I would end up saying are not surfacing here, although I think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? I think I remember once reading about oh shit I lost my train of thought oh yeah, I think it might have been PROPNAME PROPNAME (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. Those few seconds that you pause when someone says "mother" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha HA! PROPNAME time's up. This has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words I was using. Thank you very much. 
__label__label0 I am residing at Castillian for my freshman year. I have my own personal room, which is more than I can say for others. It is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. The entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. All the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. My parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things I'd like to do. They try so hard to make me happy, but I'm not. I feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. I also believe that this was their full intention. We'll call it a bribe. They spit out money as long as I do well. This shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and I myself would like to succeed as best I can. The bribe, however, is the problem. I'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. Dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. Everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. Your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. You can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. I have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. I go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. When it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. Already after the first day of class, I have messed up terribly on homework. I am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. In fact, it actually brought me to tears. An assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. I see myself as pathetic because I failed myself and because I can crack so easily. I can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 0  0 with a one hour lunch break each day. If I had to guess, I would say that I was unsure of everything. I'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. On top of this, I'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. I'm sure it will all level out in the end and that I'll eventually get the swing of things. As of now, however, I feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. I only wish I wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in LOCNAME hadn't died last week). It only seems to complicate things. Also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. Perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. All I know is that it seems so much right now. 
__label__label0      The green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today. I really hope it doesn't rain again today because I got really wet yesterday. That ticking closk is really annoying me. I never really notice it until I I have to go to work though. Theres my sisters PROPNAME PROPNAME book. I wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good. I really hope it is. I have no idea why my Dad is so into trains right now, hes been collecting them everywhere. I think this is his midlife crisis hobby. We had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called PROPNAME just to ride a steam train. It wasn't really worth it. I wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did. That French toast i made this morning really wasn't very good. I left a funny taste in my mouth. I should probably go brush my teeth, they have syrup all over them. I am so tired I shouldn't have stayed up as late as i did last night. Putting my thoughts on paper is really hard. I have no idea what to write.  My arm hurts. I think its because i haven't streched it since volleyball season last year. I hope the team does well this year. I'm pretty confident they will. They have some really good players this year. i wonder how good of a player Mr. PROPNAME's daughter really is. she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do, considering. The new coach seems to be aa good coach though. I really hope she's able to build up a strong team. I wish that I could play for one more year. volleyball is so much fun. I wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball. That would be a whole lot of fun. PROPNAME alread y said she didn't want to do it. She is so unmotivated sometimes. I think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer. My hand is getting tired. Its probably just because I haven't typed hardly anything for the entire summer. I really want to take a typing class somewhere so I would learn how to type a lot faster. That would make papers a lot easier to write.   
__label__label0      whats up im tearing awwaaayyy  my name is Hope i like fish, and stuff like that, sarah's music is loud so it is hard to write i think. . my room has lilo and stitch in it a lot, my doll is funny from that movie it is green, it's name is PROPNAME i'm not really sure how to spell it. the suite mates across from us are very loud, they like to laugh a lotPROPNAME it's not really laughing it's more like cackling and shouting at the same time. . This drowning pool song is a good song but the lead singer died the other day. I wish my hair didn't take so long to dry and straighten and everything it gets annoying and makes me mad sometimes  the phone is ringing in the room across the bathroom they're so loud    I like goldfish i'm glad i got them from the campus store. . Grace is yelling 'give me a break' and clapping they are so loud it took me awhile to learn they're names because they're both so loud and its hard to distinguish them- i forgot my apostrophe in that it's but now i guess i don't need it   I wonder what brittany is doing today- she doesnt spell her name like PROPNAME so i always try to write it like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I haven't talked to her in awhile i really should call her more often but she lives so far. it's such a long walk. plus i should call PROPNAME, but PROPNAME doesnt call me so i don't know why i should    I don't know if she moved in with her boyfriend or if she lives at home, she invited me to hang out with her the other day and then her cell phone broke- i called PROPNAME's cell phone the other day  uh-oh Incubus  (not sure how to spell that)  and actually no i messaged taylor and it said it was his sister and he told me he had a new phone and gave his to her but i don't believe him. PROPNAME has cute hair, just because he's original with it. i miss the mall and visiting taylor at gadzooks before i went to work, i liked walking past there and seeing him, then seeing ashley and toni at electrocell, then going up the escalators to journeys and saying hi to russell and krystal and hollye   krystal owes me 00 dollars she has been so mean lately because she's so obsessed with her boyfriend   I don't think that a boyfriend should mean that much to somebody, they're just going to screw you over in the end, and you're going to need yoru friends to fall back on, unless of course you alienate them like shes done to all her friends. i miss kirkland's too, all my buds were there-it wasn't the same though without amber and brandye- i felt so bad for amber this weekend because robert didnt call her back- just another evident sign that boys are trouble    eddie is probably trouble i don't know why i like him   i can tell he's just another liar like PROPNAME-  PROPNAME broke my wittle heart i can't believe i let myself trust him, it is kind of upsetting to think how much he upset me and i still kept calling him, i won't do that again,, sarah's playing limp bizkit; at junior prom ben reagan drove me and we listened to limp bizkit on the way to dustin's house i thought it was unromantic, i can't believe dustin's dating amanda- shes actually pretty nice i went to that foam party with her the other night and she was cool   however she did call me and her and jenifer asked me to go to the game with them but when i said i didnt want to they said 'but we need your extra ticket'   awww our lady peace they are so awesome i was so happy that PROPNAME went withme to their concert even though she doesnt like them. i was kind of mad that she dragged us from the front near the stage to the back because she was hot    elimidate is onn!! i love that show, PROPNAME was on it and won, i wonder why cody hasnt called me maybe he thinks he'll get in trouble because he's a teacher and i'm a student or maybe i'm just not good enough for him    I don't konw but i should go back and visit Ms. PROPNAME and tell her i'm thinking about switching my major to art or architecture. i don't know i think architecture would be more fun then architectural engineering thats hard to spell. . . i would like to design things i just think there's not a lot of money in architecture or especially in studio art, but my mom says there is    she was really cool about my losing my check card the other day    i was so upset about it especially when i thought i had lost my UT id thingy too  that woulda sucked then i couldn't have gotten food i think that i type too fast, all the freshman in my BCIS class last year used to stare at me and be like whoa she types fast   and i'd be like yeah thats because i'm cooler than you. scott was in my class and he knew amber but he always called her nicole. i'm sleepy its 00 pm i think i should be in bed considering i have class at 0 tomorrow   i hafta go because i have to turn in my homework,   jenifer hancock and me worked on our homework together today in the study lounge,  when she took the top off her bottle-o-water it made a funny noise and i remember getting mad for some odd reason. . i want to go home this weekend but i think my friend's are going to want me to go to some parties with them  however   i don't drink so i don't think it will be that fun. sarah is doing her homework online i like when it says 'correct' i'm glad that sarah thinks the neighbors are loud too, i guess at they're house screaming this late was acceptable   omg and that girl yesterday sitting outside OUR door on her phone, what was she thinking???? she knew we saw her and she was just being loud to be mean i guess and i just wanted to open the door and be like HEY i can hear your whole conversation and i am trying to study so couldyou be q-u-i-e-t please but she wouldnt have understood anyways. . if i were to go home i don't think james would want me there, it's not really my house anyway, i hope they're watering my plant because i love it! especially the little pot its so small and fat   there was a pot like that at kirklands that crystal always talked about how cute it was and amber thought that i said krystal was a size 00 but i meant the crystal at kirklands and it was really funny i thought it was sweet how they got me that cookie cake   i am so mad that my mom left all that stuff in the fridge, and my shelves and parakeet from kirklands on the floor of the apartment   whatever there prolly weren't even any fleas i mean she got her zelda books but she couldnt get my stuff???  she said i left some shoes there i hope i got all the cute ones   what else was there i don't remember oh yeah my sea monkeys they had gotten big, there used to be a buncha little ones and now theres just a few big ones i thought that was funny i'm going to hafta get some more because thos were pretty cute 
__label__label0 tomorrow we're going to see carrie, i'm really excited, i think but then there's also being anxious about it. i know i should be happy and in many ways i am, it's just weird. because i mean things with lisa have been on the weird side lately adn i don't think it's going to get any easier. maybe it's only this period of transition. i'm glad that lisa's comign out of her shell, i guess i'm still not wanting to. but then thea'ts not really something i like doing. typing on the keyboards makes little to no sense. at least with eva's keyboard, it's letters are separated, i wonder how she writes like that. i hate my dingy old omsputer though its so crappy i wish i could get s\a new one, but theen it'd be bad wasting it on some money. i wonder who that professors in waking life was. matthew said he teaches at LOCNAME but i guess it'd be hard to find him. there are al million billion people on campus. which has been weird cause i've been seeing people that i didn't really think i'd see again. i don't quite know what to do about that. i wish that john and i were better friends so we could hang out somewhere away from here and everything in my life wouldn't be so complicated and connected for once. i wonder what he thingsk of me, i hope i'm not imposing too much, i gues its been a while since there has been someone that's really interested me and i wish i could make him be interestedd in me too. i think its that need for love that we all have that makes me get this way. i guess i'd feel much better if i had someone that could hold my hand and listen to everything. i wish on some level i could be taht way with matthew, but when i'm with him, its so much more different. oh god. i'm only been writing for 0 minutes? what am i supposeed to write about. i wonder if this will give me writer  s cramps. that carpal tunnel ? syndrome. i doubt it. but i don't know this is probly the most work i've had to do for a class so far. that and going to cnetral market, which wasn't too bad. i don't see all the glamour of central market yet, but who knows maybe it's there. i'm glad that i know some people in my classes, at least in my art related classes. theatre and psychology are other things. i wnat to be able to go up and talk to someone, but its so freaking intimidating. i think i'll make it a point next time to come early so i can get a good seat. i just wish i wasn't so tired all the time so i could really enjoy those classes. i thought i'd be spending alot more time being intellectually stimulated than i have been since classes startedd. maybe it just takes aw hile. i dunno, i still miss some aspects of high school. god, that sounds lame. and i know it is on most levels, i just miss how easy it was. but maybe not. the latter part of high school was hell. especially senior year. and really before senior year. i can't believe i still think about him sometimes. i must be liek the biggest loser in the world. i wonder if its because of him that i'm still get malfunctioney sometimes. but most days, i know for sure that's not true. maybe i just need someone or something to constantly be thinking about. like i need some drama in my life so i create it for myself by bringing up something that really bothered me even though its way in the past. i can't spend all this time and energy trying to analyze myself. it gets exhausting. i just should forget about it sometimes and just have funn. but then that gets you to be too so-called   shallor  . . that's really lame. i should just not be this way. i don't know. its not like i really think this way all the time. maybe i do but i guess it just seems different when actually writing out ideas as they come. i guess thats what i did with paper journal. thought i've become too lazy to keep up with one. i wonder how anna is doing. i'm glad she keeps in touch with carrie at least. in my aspect i totally understand why she wouldn't make too great of an effort to talk to me. god, i'm such an ass sometimes. hmm. . maybe i should eat ramen. it was so good today. but i dunno, that would mean i got to go work out or something and i know i'll regret it later. i'm tired of worrying about weight but then the flabbiness is not good to look at. i wonder how really obese peopel can live. i mean, not to be rude, but i feel really bad for them. if i were in their position and had trouble with just like moving around and stuff i might just die. aimee is going to sleep and this static crap is annoying the shit oputta me. i guess that's that whole buyy cheap. less quality thing. god but now its' like louder than ever. there headphones off muuuuuch better. my computer is so stupid. makes too much noise. i want to meet john someday. i hope he writes back soon. i guess i was kind of a big jerk for waiting so long to write to hiom. gosh, i hate that. it could have been fixed and we could be writing each other back and forth like we used to. . but noo. . i'm a big freaking idiot. ahh maybe i shouldn't try so hard. he's different than most guuys i know, i think. and i dunno, i really would like to see him one day. at least as friends, even though that might be kind of big and scary. maybe we'll just keep corresponding through email. that would be enough to keep me happy. i think. it's just weird giving so much of yourself so honestly and candidly and without prided or shame to someone you have never seen in real life. though, la 
__label__label0     I am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. Although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, I'm still going to think as I write this intro. You see, it's my birthday today, and so I could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. I'm taking a girl I like to a party tonight - I guess that might be more interesting. Or maybe I should just talk about how my parents really piss me off.          Since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. But before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. They would bitch about anything, seriously. I mean, I had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. My friend PROPNAME once told me I should get in a lot of trouble. Then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. For some reason I never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. But, he was right. When they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year.        Okay, new topic. When I was over at my friend PROPNAME's house one day, this kid pulls out PROPNAME's . 00 rifle. I'm like,   Dude, don't point that at me, turn it away.   He listens, and he starts pointing it at PROPNAME. PROPNAME is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. This kid is pointing the rifle at PROPNAME, making shooting noises, while PROPNAME is playing a ORGNAME game. For some reason, I had a really bad feeling. This was not a toy - it was a gun. POP!  All of a sudden it went off. The thing was, the kid was at such close range, Alex couldn't even feel the blast. I had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. I ran to call the ambulance, and I think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. Anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), I've never liked guns.          My phone's ringing right now, but I'm not going to pick it up since I'm doing this assignment. You know, I bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. That's so boring. I like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. Looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. I'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. But thanks for listening and I'll catch you on the flip side.        
__label__label1 I just finished working out. It was pretty tiring. I haven't worked out in awhile. It's kind of cold in the room right now. I'm always cold. I dont' really know why. It's kind of weird. I miss PROPNAME so much. Gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. It's good that I can see and talk to him, but everytime I do see and talk to him, I just get sad. I want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least I'll see him at Thanksgiving. That will give me something to work forward to. Hmmm. My sister's husband is here for the weekend. It's still really weird. I can't imagine my sister married. It's quite strange. But she seems happy, so it's good. I feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than I am though. Kind of makes me feel bad. But I'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. I'm going to work really hard this sememster. I have nothing else to do really. I can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. With is kind of poopy. Because I actually get along better with guys. But it's ok, because he can't do anything either. I was going to write something and I just forgot what. I do that a lot. I'll like so upstairs or something and then I'll forget why I went upstairs. Yeah, it's pretty strange. Hmm. the tv is going on in the background. It's a pretty funny show. I need to go to the bathroom. I just drank a lot of water. But I still have like 00 minutes left on the clock. Wow. 00 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. I'm not homesick at all. I knew I probably wouldn't be. I've always been the independent type. Pipit is a pretty good roommmate. We dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so I don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. She's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. I'm always on the webcam, so I guess its' good that she goes out or I think she'd be really annoyed. I havent' really met anyone new yet. I guess going ot ORGNAME does that to you. You stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. Plus, it's weird. Even when I'm hanging out with friends or something, I'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. Man, I'm such a nerd. Haha, oh well. I think calculus will be my hardest class. I hate math. Ugh, at least I will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. But it's like simple math. So I'll be ok. At least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. Ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. I tend to do that a lot too. I always look at the time. Even though i pretend not to. I still do out of the corner of my time. It's like I try to trick myself. But it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. A lot of people are gone for the church retreat. I dunno. I kind of of wanted to go, because I didn't go last year, but I'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. I feel like all they do is judge you. The pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. Yeah, I think it's pretty dumb. It's makes me really mad sometimes. They have no right to judge. My spiritual life is between me and God and no one else. uughh. Yeah, but I think I'm going ot find a new church when I go back from college. That will be good for me I think. PROPNAME is iming my sister right now. I still feel kind of bad for him. They went out for like 0-0 years and then my sister marries someone else. But it's for the better. THey fought like everyday and he would always cry. SO that's not too healthy either. I miss my doggies too. Dusty PROPNAME PROPNAME and even Mocha. Awww. my Dusty. I want him here to keep me company. I think Dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. Because I know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. He's so old already. It's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. That's going to be one sad day. I had a bad dream last night. PROPNAME dream-cheated on me. Man, that sucked. I was sooo mad when I woke up. I must be really insecure or something. THis is the second time I've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. Hahaha. That's pretty funny. It kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. With a passion too. It's pretty bad. But PROPNAME has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. PROPNAME is like a brother and I think of him as a girl too. I wonder if he knows?  He should. people always make fun of him about it. But maybe he just think we're kidding or something. Hmmm. maybe we should tell him. Dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. I don't think I exactly have the right technique. I wish I still played piano like before. I want to relearn the PROPNAME song. Maybe I will. . if I motivate myself to. That would be really good. That music class is pretty simple though. I hope these 0 months until Thanksgiving so really really fast. I cant' wait to see PROPNAME. Man, I think about him a lot. 
__label__label0      Well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that I have ever done, I can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 00 minutes, wait 00 minutes and 00 seconds. That was some math I was hoping to avoid. I wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact I shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, YES! oh wait no thats not right There is still that whole writing thing I'm doing. Come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. For better or for worse. At least the week has begun. In high school thats the last thing I would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how I feel now. Upon self reflection though I realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that I had to work all weekend. Oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. Looking around the room I see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. The last one that I got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in LOCNAME did they say they were from? Can't Remember. Anyway the poster was one I had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. It's a nice photograph of an H bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the Zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. Ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. Good. Even though this is a course assignment I feel very idle, a feeling that I don't particularly like. don't get me wrong I like not having anything to do but I have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. I wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). Well of course it wouldn't, but I am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. The abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking I need to finish that first chapter). It was something that I had never given much thought to other then what I saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. I had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now I have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. Of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (I wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). Was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? If there wasnt there should be. Except maybe with they dozens of typos I am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. Continue writing? I don't think so. 
__label__label1      i don't know well, why do i start with i don't know? i still don't know, haha. this is kind of fun, just like i'm typing with friends. but anyways, it's gona be a stressful day, or week next week, cause, well, schychology, however u spell that. it's gona be tough, 0 for the price of one, where's my other   A   then??? hehe. anyways, it's gona be alright. i think anything can be turned into a song, or just regular poems, they r lyrics. all lyrics are is that they have a tone to it, or a beat, or something like that. they are fun, and good way to show off little talent =) well, i guess it's kind of weird, first time when i have to type what i'm thinking off for a grade. what's up with that? and while i'm doing this, i'm thinking what to type, and what not to type, things that's too personal definatly can't be on here, but seriously, who's ever gona read this   crap   anyways? stream of concious, i'm gona wear my fingers out before   some body stop me  --Mask. haha. thinking about movies, it's kind of cool, thinking about girlfriend, and all the relationship i've had, which is quite interesting. and now back to school work, i guess. bus. major, tough deal, don't really know what i'm gona do, i really want to travel, make money, ofcourse, can't forget about the girls. but how am i going to succede when there's tons and tons of people just as talented as i am if not smarter??? what advantages do i have??? advantages, intersting. well, i'm smart, a little bit, and thoughtful, not too much of that times to times. adaptive, then whateles? i do love people, still think it's gona take a little time for me to acually get into the social scene. i'm built, have a good sense of humor, like to dance, a little bit of a   show off   and well. i'm thinking, it's kind of hard to be so complimentary towards self???. is my concious getting me??? haha. never!!!  what's concious anyways?? is it the things which never been said out of mouth, but knows deep inside? or is it   personal truth   of somewhat??? then questions come up, does everyone have a concious??? or is it just me having too much, haha. oh my. i looked up, and i can really type, or i can really think, or i can really think and type at the same time, and i make really terible jokes!!! haha. i laugh at myself, or such confidence yet pockets of insecurities. now i'm thinking, am i revewling too much on this thing? well, again, to emphasis on this point, NO ONE'S EVER GONA READ THIS!!! i do like psch, but never thought it be this way, i think i like philosophy better, yep. but then, it's kind of fun to know how i think, because i'm human, and i'm interested in everything about how it works. well, guess i'll take a break now, then to color, what color do i like? black, it's cool, it's dark, mysterous, and it's just a sense of honor, and sharpness to things. why am i talking so much about myself? am i self centered? am i selfish?? why!!! no. . . i don't want to be like this, i'm not, i refuse to be. . haha. well, why don't i use the rest of times to write a song,     it's raining outside  my mind suddenly flies  across the mountain  and over the ocean    well, maybe not, only 0 mins left. let's just leave it as that. to sit at my rhe. class, looking at the trees outside, i ask myself, are the branches moving, or is it this building. basically, i'm questioning my own truth, and my belief. or is it just that it's fun to be weird times to times??? but think about it, how do you know that water   
__label__label1 I really don't know which house I liked best. The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 0-0 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if PROPNAME and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 00 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 0. 0 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 0. 0 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope PROPNAME is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 0 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. PROPNAME was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 0 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. PROPNAME said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. PROPNAME just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 0 minute to go. . nice. PROPNAME got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0 bye  
__label__label0      Today is September 00, 0000. Exactly one year since the attack on the twin towers, the attack on our country occured. Today is a day of sorrow, of mourning, but also a day of pride. As I watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others I was deeply touched. Atfirst I was sad as I thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind. But know, as I have watched as our country has come together, I am extremely proud. I remember at this time last year, American pride was so awesome all across the country. People had their flags out and people just helped each other. People began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country. Today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation, and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process. I can remember exactly where I was when the second plane crashed. I was in my creative writing class and a girl, PROPNAME PROPNAME, walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers. My teacher turned on the TV and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing. And then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes. We were in shock and I remember I got the chills. I think that I will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me. I remember watching the news as people cried through the streets holding pictures of their loved ones, looking desperately for them all over, just hoping that they weren't in the crash. Today, is a day of remembering though and also a day of forgetting, trying to go on with our daily lives and overcome the terrorism that has overtaken our country.       College life besides the horrific event that we are remembering is going well. I joined TriDelt and am in the greek system. At first I didn't really want to be a tridelt and was disappointed, but now I am really happy. Our pledge class is so amazing and a lot of the girls in it are really cool. We participated in this field day event last saturday and it was really fun. I got to know a lot of the girls better and we bonded. We also went on our pledge retreat that night as well which was a good experience. We were all really exausted but we tried to socialize and get to know each other. Last night I went to this praise and worship thing called Escape. It was at this guys house and there were so many people there. Usually there aren't that many people who go, but last night so many came that we had to go in the backyard. It was awesome even our in the heat. It was so reassuring to see that there are other Christians on this campus and I felt very close to the lord there in that backyard with complete strangers and the dog barking in the background. It is so easy to lose focus here on theis campus, and last night was so helpful for me to really  remember what is really important in this life. I sometimes feel myself getting lost in school and in sorority and greek life, that I'm like I just don't have enough time for my quit times. The fact of the matter is, He should be my number one prioroty, and l;ately he hasn't been. I am working on it though, and we just have to do the best we can. But, I am really excited to be here more and more each and every day. I am meeting so many new people and having so much fun with the old friends that I came here with. We just do th

__label__label1      ever since my boyfriend got this new job as a community assistant in an apartment complex, it doesn't seem like he has any time left over to spend with me. also, since he is a higher rank in rotc, he is even busier. so i question. what's going to happen to us? i ask him over and over again and he just gets upset. what am i supposed to think? every time this happens, we end up in an argument and threaten to break up which really hurts. i mean, he can't play with my emotions like that. it's not fair that he can have me waiting for him and giving up all my other plans in the hope that maybe this time, he'll come see me or make plans with never happens. it's not fair how he can just have me on the side when it's convenient to him. why is is that he seems like a totally different person now. not the same from the guy that i met more than a year ago. how can someone just change overnight? i am upset that when he does come and see me, it's is timed cause he says he's trying to squeeze me into his busy schedule. it make me feel like i am in prison and getting visitation rights or something. relationships shouldn't be like that. it was never like that in the begining. but he says he's a different person now. he just called right now and hung up on me because i told him i couldn't talk cause i was doing this thing for the psychology class. he's mad. but what am i supposed to do? after all, the reason i am here, is to go to school and learn and stuff. if he expects me to understand everything he does why can't he understand that i need to do this thing.  i feel like i'm gaining a little bit of weight and that bothers me a lot. yet, i'm too stubborn to get into a diet and too lazy to go excercise at the gym.  i am sooooo stresed out. not just from the crap i have to put up with my boyfriend but also because of school work and the crap i have to put up to with work. work does not seem fun anymore. it was in the begining when i first started working there for more than a year ago. maybe because it was my very first job and i was getting paid more that i thought i would be. or maybe it was cause i'm new in town and was meeting lots of people then who are my age. but now, it seems like work is just a drag. maybe i'm jealous cause my boyfriend has this wonderful job or may be it's cause a lot of the people and managers that i started working with left to another state or for another occupation and just wanted to get away. i need the money that is why i am still working there. i applied at the hospital a couple of weeks ago but they haven't called me back or anything. then last week, i decided i wanted to volunteer at the children's hospital and when i called to inquire about it to see what i got to do, they told me that they were good. they were good? how can that be. they're a hospital. i thought they always needed help. and i was going to do some services for free. it's not like i was going to ask pay or anything. it was going to be free. my boyfriend's roomate's mom works there and the roomate had told me that he was going to ask his mom to give me a job and he did and she said that all i needed was to give her the hours that i can work. i mean, i can do that but it would be really awkward in my position because the mom is my boyfriends ex mom. i just didn't want to be in that position you know? and i really need to start working in the nursing field and get out of being a cashier at heb because that's my major, nursing. that's another thing i was worried about. what if i don't get accepted to nursing school next semester? then what am i going to do? maybe i can switch to pharmacy just like what my friend did. but i don't think it will be any easier or anything. it was funny because one of my friends from my apartment complex is also a pharmacy major and was sucking up really bad to his pharmacy teacher so he 
__label__label1    i hope that i can finish my genetics homework by the middle of this week. and i hope that i can somehow get in touch with my genetics teacher and TA. that's really important to me. i also wish that there was something like key club i could join. so that i could go do some community service. preferably with children. i love kids. they're so cute. today i saw some 0 and 0 year olds playing in the playground outside of church. they were so incredibley cute. ben knew right away that i wanted to take them home. whenever i say that, i'm not actually SERIOUS. i just meant that i wish i had some kids, even though i'm only 00 and i plan on staying in school for at LEAST another 0 years. plus the 0 years of residency after medical school. i hope i do well on my mcats. i should probably sign up for that class at the princeton review. either that or i need to start taking time out in my day to practice in my mcat book. and i'm almost positive that i'm going to make it into medical school. there's almost no doubt in my mind. although there is a little, because of some of the statistics that people have been telling me. something about how only 000 people from UT make it into medical school a year. i wonder if it matters that i'm not using hardly any proper grammer or punctuation marks. i almost forgot how to spell punctuation. i used to be a really good speller. and my vocabulary used to FANTASTIC. seriously. it's gone down though, because i just don't read as much. i wish i did. i wish i've read alot of books that daniel has, then we'd have more in common. he's so much like PROPNAME's daniel that it's freaky. they look alike, talk alike, and they even act alike! alike. same. my asian american studies teacher says that those words don't mean the same. i just used that word to describe itself. i'm pretty sure that that's not right, but i guess there's nothing i can do about it. janet's been gone for an hour now. it's alway so lonely without her in the room, but i don't mind it so much. that way, i can actually get some work done. not that i don't get anything done when i'm with her, but obviously she'd be a distraction. and since i get distracted so easily, the less people to talk to, the better. am i supposed to just stop typing at exactly 00 minutes? or will the screen change for me? and what's the point of this anyways? i wasn't in the first class, so i don't have any clue what this is for or if it's a grade. and now i'm listening to some weird music that i downloaded. i guess it really isn't weird, i've just never heard it before. it's kind of like rap. or a mix of some sort. interesting. it keeps repeating   i'm a freak,   it's a little annoying. hopefully the words will change. if they don't in. 00 seconds. i'll change the song myself. oh what do you know, now it's adding like 0 more words or something. hahaha. does it count that i typed myself laughing? does that even make sense? oh goodness, i'm changing this song. it's getting to me. ORGNAME. as soon as i finished typing that, the song ended. that was pretty funny. wow, i've already been typing for 00 minutes. i guess i shouldn't be surprised, i don't ever have a problem just rambling on. my back hurts from hunching over, so now i'm sitting up really straight. i like the rain, except that i don't like the humidity. i just thought of that because i looked out the window and it's getting dark. well, it should be getting dark anyways, because it's almost 0. speaking of the time, why hasn't andy called me? he said he'd call me when he went to go eat dinner today. he always does that. i miss hanging out with andy and ben so much. they're always doing their own thing now, and i guess that's a sign that i need to go out and make my own new friends. but i just like hanging out with them, you know? and i like their friends. especially daniel. i'm always wondering what he's thinking; that boy is so quiet. i wish i knew what he thought of me. i really really wish that andy and ben were more. what's the word? protective? of me. i'd really like it if they called me to do things with them, or just to hang out with them when they're not doing anything. that would make me so happy. i haven't seen thi tran in a week. i wonder what she's up to? i should have called her, but i don't know why i didn't. i had a headache like 00 minutes ago, but after all this random writing and stuff, i've almost forgotten about it. i want to watch some disney movies. i haven't seen one of those in a LONG time, and they're all so great. i saw part of harry potter yesterday. i love that movie. i talked to daniel though, and he said that he likes the book better than the movie. which i guess is true. book to movie translations are never good. my phone just rang. some lady wanted to know if i had any junior girls and senior boys in my family or something. i have no idea what for. something about research. that was strange. tonight i'm going grocery shopping with janet and steven. she really likes steven. and he really likes her; i've been telling her that all week. it seems that me and janet are really going to get along. i hope so. i love her so much; she's so much fun. oh yeah, so about the book to movie translations. i HATED the count of monte crist movie. the new one that is, i've never seen the old one. i mean, the book is my most favorite in the world, and in the movie they had to go screw around with things. and they left out alot of GREAT parts too. it made me so sad that i cried. priscilla and stephanie and josh thought i was funny when that happened. ben and andy were watching black hawk down when we were in the other theater. it's funny how i remember little things like that, but it takes a bit more for me to remember the things that i need to. for example: things i need to do, what to study, things i've studied. and my 00 minutes are almost up. there's 00 seconds or so left. so i suppose that this is the end of my writing assignment. i hope this is sufficient. or i'm going to feel silly. oh well. no time to change it now. BYE! 
__label__label1 Before i came to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, I have always thought that i wanted to be a doctor. I did not know any requirements of getting into medical school. But after I came to ORGNAME, I started to hear all hardships that make people give up on medical school. My major is biology. I thought that I have to have biology major to be a pre-med, yet it is not true. I can have any kind of major as long as i take all classes that are required for medical school. I want to get high GPA this semester or this year so that i can change my major to biomedical engineering. If i have that major, i would not have to worry about not getting into medical school, for they have other kinds of job even though you don't get into medical school.   Actually, if i keep my major, i do not have to worry about taking extra classes, because i need to take a lot of biology and chemistry classes to get into medical school. If i have different major than biology, i have to take more classes to get into medical school and get my degree of that major.   I think that I always have dilemma in my life, as i am experiencing right now. Even for little things like choosing between going home or staying at school.  For example, I want to go home this weekend, yet I am going to be too tired to work anything on Sunday for preparing for classes, if i go home. On the other hand, if I don't go home this weekend, i will not be able to go until all the exams are finished, which is beginning of the October.   My parents and I were separated for more than 0 years while i was in highschool in LOCNAME. April of this year, finally my parents came to LOCNAME to live with me. But I came to ORGNAME, so we are separated again. I miss my parents very much.   Sometimes I think it is good to be separated from parents, and live by myself. It made me more a mature and independent person. It is the first step of getting in a big society as adult.   In here, no one tells me to what to do. But sometimes that makes me feel more scary. I need to manage my schedule wise and control everything that happens to me. I don't have any person to depend on besides a few friends. Friends are helpful and cheerful to me, yet i can not find same comfort from them as I used to find from my family.   I hope that I work hard everyday no matter what kind of situation I have so that i can achieve my goal that is to go to medical school and be a doctor. 
__label__label0      College. . humm. Its strange that I'v made it this far. I always viewed college as a date in a book that i would eventually reach, but not now. There is absolutely nothing familiar anymore. My days are completely different. I guess change is good though, I mean there is no place I would rather be in life than right here. So why am I so worried all the time?  Constantly tierd. My eye has developed a slow twitch, very strange. I miss my cat. I wish I had the ability to purr. If only I were a cat. The weirdest thing about college is waking up. Every day of my life until now I have woken up in my bed or some state of comfort. Now when I wake up there is that small period of time when I think I am still there, safe, but then reality smacks me in the face. My roomate is really good at that in the morning, helping me realize that im not at home. Very annoying! I wish i enjoyed my roomates companey, but I don't not at all. She smacks while eatting, very inconsiderate, keeps the room at 00000 million degrees. Ah What am I going to do, not a whole lot, I guess its a good learning expeirence. I must say I have met some cool people though, which make the ride all worth while. Counting Crows,, ahh, for some reason they know exactly what I am feeling. They   hit the nail on the head  . I wish I could talk to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and spell correctly. The thing that I have noticed about college is there are more headachs and less sleep. more headachs, less sleep. I really should deal with this problem. It seems impossible with all the things I have to get done but eventually I have found that everything works it self out. Time, time , time. I do not believe in time. There really is no point to time. Well at least keeping track of. I mean time is good for healing and new stages in life. But why do  we put it on such a small scale. I mean it should just be a concept, like infinity. I mean I wish I could not say at this exact moment it is . . 00. 00. 00. There should only be moments and nothing more. We all live in one big moment. Another thing thats been on my mind is something A friend and I were talking about. He said why does society make squares out of everything. I mean think about it the majority of buildings in this world are in the square shape, rooms are square, tiles are square, I think I might go out in the square hallway and take a drink from the square water fountian. It is exausting. Why would someone go to such detail to make a square out everything. The name square even sugessets boring. Why not an oval, or better yet an amiba. No one can box me in. I also am frustrated with the fact that everyone wants to have a career,Example,   Yeah I'm pre-med, ohh yeah well I'm going to be an engineer    I really have to desier to   make something of myself  . What my career will be is sitting in LOCNAME,no preference really any where in LOCNAME will do, with a big family,lots of animals, and friends walking around soaking upp all the history, looking at the arcitecture, and most importaltly just being happy. I could just learn the rest of my life. with no money , which is a square by the way. . 
__label__label1      why am i nervous about this assignment, it can't be wrong, i feel like i'm writing so randomly, i'm usually so structured, or am i , i really haven't been lately, i'm so lazy sometimes, like today i didn't want to go to physics class and i just didn't wake up, i think i turned my alarm off, but i'm not 000% sure, i really don't like early early classes, it's such a bum to get up for them, on and on and on, and even if they don't go on like that, it's just such a pain having to get up for them, i mean it's so blessed early, 0:00 in the blamin morning, i mean come on, who wants to be studying physics at that time of morning, it's way to early, way too early, and u'd think that with all the money the university has, it could  get some professors who speak good english, not that they don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, it just seems a little out of place, that's all, this place sure is a mixing pot, names i've never seen before and many i'll bever be able to pronounce, so many people, so many names, just going down the hall and meeting some random person and talking for hours, and bam! u have a friend, or two, or 0 as the case may be, i mean sheesh, this is the place to be, there's just so much to do that u never feel like doing your homework, except this assignment, i actually like this one, it has purposed guised beneath it's apparent randomidity, i really should reconsider my major, i can't stand to get up for calculus, i dread physics and i loath chemistry, but when it comes to things like psychology, government, history, english, i can't wait to get to class, i don't despise having to get to know enough to pass the blamin test, i teach it to others, spend spare time to find the little intricate details that so intrigue my intellect, the adjectives and grammatical spurts that titilate the mind as opposed to the numbers and inferences that wear on one's nerves like grating concrete on your skull, one's a vacation and one's imprisonment, i really should get more sleep, i'm having trouble typing straight, or maybe it's just the rediculously small amount of space i have to write on this little desk with my frankenstein computer, how am i going to afford my chem book,no, not chem, my philosophy book, whoops, great one to put on here, they now think i'm horrible, no i really love psych, i even had it in high school, just haven't gotten the book yet, have to go to the financial aid office to get my mess straightened out, then got to do my blinkin physics homework tonight, jeez, and i've got to get the stupid dart transit thing worked out, they really need more hours in the day or some thing like that, everyone wants money and almost noone will come to dinner, people say they'll call and never do, people say they'll stop by and never do, do i need a message board? will anyone actually use it, or will people erase it if they do? am i paranoid? it's possible, in most cases i'm just prepared and my wrists are getting a little tired from typing in this awkward position, that is with this numbskull desk here, i'll probably get carpal tunnell or something, see even my spelling's going, that's what too much math will do to a person, i honestly don't understand this new calculus course i'm in, since when do mathemeticians make INFERENCES, in these problems we're having to make a whole string of INFERENCES to come a concrete answer? i think not! math is supposed to be about numbers and certainties and the correct technical notation which my TA and professor seem to think is unneccessary, IT IS NECESSARY, i mean come on here, u can't just start putting stuff down and have it be correct, if u don't define it right it could mean anything, i've seen sounder arguments made against abortion in philosophy class than i've seen arguments made for what some limit or sequence is, i thought math was supposed to be the one infallible, untouchable truth because it relied on cold hard unchangeable numbers, but NO, i'm in stinking cal 0 and i've hardly seen a solid number yet, most of what i've seen is shifty half arguments that if used in a court case would set a criminal off scott free, and they claim it to be the language of the universe? if that's so then it's just a confusing and complex a language as english because there's always some exception, some little thing that messes you up, some minor, minute, miniscule tidbit that u miss that makes the entire thing false, give me a break people, and as if it were easy to pay attention in class anyway, with the shorts and shirts the fine ORGNAME woment wear, it's a wonder any studying gets done at all, and in the one class i do have a relatively subdued female population, i have a professor that seems like everybody's grandpa and does nothing but write formulas on the board and make side comments about important rules that are already supposed to be common knowledge, NO they are not common knowledge, maybe to u, but u already HAVE your stinkin PhD, we haven't even gotten a bachelor's yet, so stop your assuming, jeez i'm thirsty, u'd think i'd been yelling all this at someone for the past 00 minutes for as dry as my mouth is, in all honesty if someone took the time they could probably findout who wrote this if they really wanted to, it's not like i haven't given enough clues already, well i'm just in the hope and confidence that they won't, oh look, time's almost up, well that was a productive venting section, now if we could only fix all of these problems, oh well, life is life and that's the way it goes, we'll just have to deal 
__label__label0      Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that PROPNAME went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 0. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss PROPNAME and my family. Living in LOCNAME is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but PROPNAME is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in LOCNAME and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish PROPNAME was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope PROPNAME, ORGNAME and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think PROPNAME is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how PROPNAME and PROPNAME live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love ORGNAME. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope PROPNAME will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. 
__label__label1 Its really hard to write what I am thinking about because when I am asked to do that, I think about what to write. I then go and think of other things that are on my mind and really don't need to be shared with the general public. What I am physically feeling right now is heat. Our house is hot although we have the a/c running non stop. Mentally, I am confused. The thoughts that go through my head at times make me think that I am crazy and that I should seek help. I am not the only one who thinks that but my family members and my friends also think that I should get some help. But truthfully, there is no help. Who controls the mind?  Ones self controls the mind. All I really have to do is concentrate and I can control myself. Powerful things can be accomplished with mind control. Its odd how sometimes I know what people are going to ask me before they ask me. It happens allot. Then people look at me in an akward form. I don't know how that happens. It just does. I can also go through the thought process of other people. Sometimes, when my friends perform certain actions, I can think the exact same thing they were thinking at the time they were doing that. The only time this thought process causes a problem is when I am reading the news and read about acts of violence against children. Its not that great when you can place yourself in the shoes of the aggressor when you really don't want to. Its all invouluntary. This would be allot easier if I was writing in pencil. I think faster when I am writing things down. It helps me organize my thoughts. When I speak to people, I like to confuse them. Sometimes I confuse them so much, they believe that a conclusion was reached at the end of our conversation but when they think about it, they find out that I only caused them to think of more questions. I don't know why I enjoy that. When we think, what do we think about the most?  What is easier or what needs a solution. Writing about what I think is hard. I am not sure if I think of too many things at once or just don't think at all. I do just stop thinking and drift off into my own world and just stay there, thoughtless?  Feelings:  mixed feelings. Not sure what to do with my life. Would prefer not to be in college but know that sucess comes with knowledge. Psychology has interested me since I was a child. I like knowing what people are thinking about. That is what I do; I observe. But observation comes with a price. Since I play the role of observer, it is hard for me to actually detail what is going on in my day and not others. People think that I really don't want to talk much about myself (which is true to some extent). What really happens is that I don't know how to organize my daily activities to be shared with others. Silence is my audience when I am by myself. But when I need to concentrate and do my homework, I need noise. I can not concentrate where it is quiet. The silence distracts me. When I read, I listen to music. When I do other homework that does not involve reading, I listen to music, talk to others, and also do the homework of another class at the same time. I need distractions to concentrate. Another physical pain came to my mind. I have back pain. Most times, I take pain killers to ease the pain. The pain killers I use arent that effective and they are stong pain killers. I take Hydrocodone and Naproxen 000 mg each. I sometimes take two naproxen and one hydrocodone or vice versa. That does very little to ease the pain. Since they are so effective, I just don't take them and deal with the pain. Thanks to my servere back pain, I am now not affected by other types of pain. I need a new body. I also have knee pains. I have joint pain. I am overweight. I need to do something with my life. Something new. I would like to skydive. Life is not worht living if you don't take risks. I ran out of things to write about. I lost my stream of consciousness. I need the weekend to be here so that I can catch up on my homework. I procrastinate too much. I have talked to a psychiatrist before. It really didnt help. Nothing helps. Once must deal with their problems themself and keep them to themself. Contorl them with ones mind and keep them undercontrol.  
__label__label0      What to write about? I don't really know. Should I talk about my fears of not successeding in life. Of my fears of never finding the true some one. Or maybe about the sadness I feel when I think about my past four years in highschool. The friendships I made and my heart that got broken more than once. Or should I talk about my family. One of my little brothers that we have a connection that is so strong I miss him very much. Or maybe I should talk about the hopes of a good year. Or maybe I should just concentrate on my work here and forget about the emotional stuff, maybe that will help. I came here for a reason, to kae something out of myself and make alot of money because of it. I also came to prvoe and show off to people that I am some body. I don;'t really know what to say. My head keeps going back to the first person I let in my heart that ended up breaking it. Why I don't know I got over him but when you hear that he has a new girlfriend it just hurts. But then I think I must lose weight so when I go back I can make him regret it. But what do I care he is not even thinking about the future. I want to have a good job with alot of money, with a loving and faithful husband, and two great sons. I guess I want boys becasue I really never got along with any girls. Me and my sister really don't have that close of bond becasue she betrade my trust and I don't really know if we can ever have the same bond. However, I I do have a great connection with my cousin who is a sophmore in highschool she knows everything about, just like my mom. My mom knows everything about me too. People think that it is weird that I tell her everything, but I don't. I can't tell my father everything because he has this vision of me that I never ever want to disappoint him. He sees me as this smart girl who can do anything. I don't see it. I believe that I can make anything out of myself, but I don't know if I can actually do it. Is it going to be to hard? I really can't tell. My dad says he will love me even if I don't make it but he says it is nonsense to think that I won't I have to prove this to myself and family and my so called friends that I left behind. None of them have really kept that much in touch only like 0 or three. Am I being selfish to think that my friends can't even email me. But I am glad I left. Most of my friend were under class men in highschool becuase  the senior   friends   that I had were never really my friends I just hanged out with them once in a while and when ever i did I felt like such an outcast. I sometimes feel like that once in a while. But I guess everyone feels out of place once in their life. I think I just have to let go of my past and MOVE on. I have to start my life here make new friends. I haven't even made one yet. I have to break out of my quiet shell and just take the risk and try to meet people. This is my time to live on my own on my rules, I justgot to wake up and do it. I have to focus on all my goals and then just do it and after I do this I should look at the end of the tunnel and see my future the things I am destined to do. Hopefully they will be great and my life will have happiness and success. Now if my roomate will stop talking to me i could write more. Mut time is ending and I must leave now. 
__label__label1 As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 0 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. LOCNAME is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 0/00/00, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 0 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 00. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 00 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the LOCNAME LOCNAME will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.  
__label__label1      I cannot believe that I am finally in college at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, living the college life is such a tremendous change from the life that I have previously been living. Before I moved to college I lived with my mother, my father, and my younger brother PROPNAME. Also living with us was our many many animlas, whom over the years grew and other times shrunk. My all time favorite however would have to be my cat Magic, whom i was very upset to leave. Magic has been my cat for about 00 years now, and he has been there though so much. Good times and bad times. The happy and the sad. More recently, about a two years ago, we had a new addition to our home. My dog Rocky, who I miss incredibly. I never thought that I would get so attached to an animal, much less a dog, becuase dogs never were my favorite pets. In fact I never really cared for dogs. But however it happened, it happened. I am totally infactuated with my dog Rocky. I would take him everywhere with me if I could. It is so hard to be at college and away from him. It is almost like he is my son or something,I often feel the need to dicspline him, and however it happens, I find myself talking to him. I anxiously await the holidays that I get to go home to see him. However, even more than my cat magic, my dog Rocky, I miss my dad. My dad has always been the most important person adn thing in my life, for as long as I can remember, I have always looked up to my dad, admired my dad, and wanted to be just like my dad. I can't stand to part from him. We have been more than just father and daugther, we have been best friends. We hung out together, laughed together and cried together. I could always trust him and tell him everything, as I still can. He always believed in me and had the most faith in me, and most important he always trusted me and my judgment. I was the one who always cooked for my dad, and ran arrands for him. I would do anything at the drop of a dime for my dad, as he would do for me. It has been hard moving to college and being away from him. I talk to him everyday, but its almost like i don't know what to say. I hate the fact that I am missing out on whats going on in his life, and he is not here to see whats going on in mine,  It just not the same hearing it over that phone. I no longer know where he is at every second, and its a hard change. I am happy to be growing upp and moving on with my life, but i don't want things to change between my dad and i. It hard because the more i grow, the less i need him, and i like that i need him, and that he needs me. Although it is hard being away form my dad, and the rest of m family, it makes the move and change so much easier having my boyfriend of 0 months, here at college experiencing the change with me. He lives in the same dorm as me (university towers) on the same floor just down the hall. It nice to have someone who i love so much be here to support me. We are lucky to have all the same classes and schedule so we always have a familiar face a around. we spend all of our time together, which i love. Every morning I make him breakfast ( i love to cook)  before we go to class. I actually cook every single meal every day for him. But i love it. Its like we are married which lots of people may not think is a good thing at this age, but its perfect. I love him so much, and he is a wonderful guy. OUr parents have become best friends in the time we have been dating. Our paretns are even going to LOCNAME this winter togetrher. This summer, PROPNAME and I (my boyfriends name is PROPNAME) went to LOCNAME together,  it was the graduation present to us from our parents. It was an incredible vacation and expereince. I had the time of my life. We went to PROPNAME, and a few places in LOCNAME. . . Nice, LOCNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, adn my favorite LOCNAME. I love the shopping. My parents love PROPNAME and as far as I know his parents love me. It is the perfect relationshop and hopefully one day will be the perfect marriage, I know its a long way off, but hopefully not to long. I know that we can be together forever, however if things change, I will be okay to, I am always ready for change although I don't really like it too much. Its hard that we have still so much to go through being as this is just the beginning of our college lives, I hope that we can make it through it together. I have to work on not being so jeolous and controlling, and really just going with the flow. I don't always have to have things planned, and if he doesnt want to do things with me, i have to be okay with that. I am working on builing my own life separate from his and then i can improve my life with him. I am so anxious to start my life and be with him forever that i forget sometimes that i am only in college and a lot can change in the next four years. I am looking foward to the next four years. I just got in to the sorority of my choice (AEPhi). hOwever i am not even sure whether or not i definitely want to be in the sorority, i am not sure if it is really my thing or not. i am happy with my boyfriend, not looking for new guys, and i have never been the type to have a lot of close girlfriends, i think it may be good for me to associate more with girls. so i am going for it. if i change my mind i can always drop out later. well tomorrow is our first sorority party it is the Phi Tie party, PROPNAME is going to come with me, I guess i will see more how i feel about this whole sorority thing tomorrow, well i have to go, my time is up.  
__label__label0      I thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. Actually, I kind of like it. It's kind of like writing a diary or journal. I feel hungry right now and am wondering what I am going to eat for lunch. I am tired of eating the same food at Jester again. The food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. I can't wait until I go home to LOCNAME this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. I miss my mom's cooking. Just a few more hours and I'll be on my way back to LOCNAME. I can't wait!  I miss my boyfriend so much. His birthday's coming up and I still need to get him a present. I don't know what to get him. It's hard for me because I don't have a car at LOCNAME. I wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. My friend just burned a new DJ cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. I miss my family. Its funny how when I'm at home I wish that I was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when I'm actually away I wish I was home. My roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. He calls her a lot. It's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  He would call me all the time. My friends are studying in my dorm right now. I feel so lazy. I'm behind in a lot of classes and I havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. I need to push myself to study before I screw up my ORGNAME again. Speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and I wish that it would over. I mean I like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. I just hate classes and studying. My friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. Its so funny. By the way the DJ cd that we burned is called DJ Prada G. It's like the DJ is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. Hmmm. Twenty minutes sure is going by slow. I have an ortho appointment this Monday so I'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because I can borrow the notes from my friend. I need to go shopping this weekend; I am so out of clothes to wear. Five more minutes. This assignment isn't too bad. When are we going to eat?  I need to start packing. I am such a procrastinator, I wait till the last minute for everything. I need to stop that. I wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. I have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. We are about to leave for LOCNAME soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. When are we going to eat?   
__label__label1 I am sitting in my dorm room right now and I just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because I don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on TV. I was so stressed out earlier today because I can not hack it in my calc. class. I went to class though only to affirm what I had previously believed. YEAH RIGHT. I used to think I was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that I am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. Simply for the fact that math is required. I am actually happier though because now I have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. I like that. I like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. I am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. I also added RTF 000 to my schedule. I am so excited for it. People annoy the crap out of me. Sometimes I wish I could just crawl into a box and never come out. Call me a crab but I don't really care. I am what I am. I feel chubby right now. I want to eat but then I don't. I know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when I don't truly want it. Wasters never want. . . good quote. Very true. I have come so far in my life. I can't believe I am finally at college. . on my own. There are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways I am lucky. It is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. That is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. Falling short of the glory of God. It is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. I lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and I also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! I will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. I can't believe I used to sell knives this summer. Seems like 0 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. One day, I hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. I would pay good money for that. I am sure every woman in the U. S. would do the same. I bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. I tan too often but I do like the feeling and I am not going to stop. 
__label__label1 the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       
__label__label1      As of this moment, I am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. I don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. I notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. I am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. I wonder what he has to say. I have this funny taste in my mouth after eating ORGNAME ORGNAME food. It isn't too pleasant. My refrigerator is making lots of noise. I think it's broken. Maybe I should get it fixed. No, I'm too lazy. I'm thinking about my boyfriend again. I think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but I don't know why I am thinking that because I love him or atleast I think I do. How do I know when I'm in love?  I ask myself this question everyday. I don't think I should be because if I was in love I would know. Love is very confusing. My boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. I haven't had this bad of a temper ever. I think some of his temper rubbed off on me. The refrigerator is making so much noise still. I feel nauseous. I want to join a sorority, but I am not sure which one to join because I have heard bad things about the ones I am interested in. I also want to join a service one, but at the same time I want to join a social one. I think I'm just going to join this service one I heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. I miss ORGNAME ORGNAME. I used to work there with my best friend. I wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. Sometimes I feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. She tends to do that. I'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but I don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. Well I know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. The refrigerator stopped making noise. Yay!  I'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. I'm confused about the directions. Are we supposed to write until the 00 minutes are over or when we finish?  That is what I ask myself. I'm really sleepy. My eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. I haven't gotten much sleep in a while. People keep staying in my dorm room and I can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. Sometimes I wish I could just tell people how I feel straight up but that never happens. I think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. She used to get mad just because I told her the truth, so I feel like I'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. Well this assignment was good. I got to speak my mind and release some stress. 
__label__label1 Well, it's been a long day. I'm really tired but I am not very excited about going to my last class, just because right after I get out I have to rush home, change clothes, and go to work. I can think of a million other things I would much rather be doing, ya know?   But, hey, that's just life, right?  It actually feels good to be working again. I always seem to get more accomplished in school, when I have a set routine. Last year, I was just a huge mess. All I did was party, never go to class, wake up and feel like crap all day. I'm only 00, but I feel like I'm already finished with my days where I don't remember anything or have a clue as to what's going on. It makes me laugh. Anyway, so it really annoys me in the library when people have their stupid cell phones on and they start ringing and then they answer it and just start chatting in a regular tone. Or on the bus!  I don't care to hear everyone's conversations they have, but they talk like they want everyone to know what they're doing. I just thought about that because it just happened a few times in a row. But I'm not really anal about anything. I'm already thinking about what I want to do when I get off work tonight. It's the weekend, yea!!  I hope PROPNAME comes into town. I haven't talked to him in like almost 0 weeks. It's really weird. I can't even understand it myself. I'm crazy about this guy and I have been for about 0 months. He says that he thinks about me all the time too. It's just like some sort of connection I felt with him from the first time I sat down and talked to him. It's weird because we just hang out and are just like the same person. He's so funny too. But we never talk or tell each other how we feel unless we're just trashed and then we vaguely remember what we said. I'm usually not like that with guys as far as not being straight up, but right now I think it's just maybe not worth it to try to get involved because he lives in houston and I am obviously here. It's like, I know it's a mutual feeling, but I wouldn't want anything to ever mess up between us, I'd rather just wait until I know the time is right and then we can be together. Anyway enough about all that. I want to go home and hang out with my family. I love them so much. They're all just so cool. I would rather be with them than any of my friends I grew up with back home. My shoulders are so tight. It's from lugging around this heavy backpack all day. The first couple of weeks of school, I didn't even have a backpack so I hauled around this little pink ORGNAME plastic kind of hand bag with all my books. That was funny. I always had to laugh at myself, I'm laughing right now. I can just picture myself walking around campus. This cute guy just walked by. Well, I really just liked his hair. I love kind of long, messy hair with curls coming out of hats. They're so sexy. and dark eyes. I love dark eyes. They just seem to be so seductive. I have no problem whatsoever staring at anybody directly in the eyes. Sometimes I think I might even scare people. I feel like I can just see right through people. It's not because I think they're necessarily cute, or even that I want to talk to them.       
__label__label0      my roommate is gone once again. to class i believe. he's a strange sucker it   really befuddles me how he denies having whey protein and instantly changes the   subject. i wish my hands weren't so swollen it might make this easier. speaking   of psycology the professors lecture today was interesting to say the least,   especially finding out that scientists sit around shocking rats to make the ejaculate   and pass out, very strange. also strange is how someone whom i thought was   one of my most hated enemies or deemed me as such is sitting next to me in that   class . and how the girl that sat next to me comes off as much more a    city   person   than she really is.      my floor is really strange, they all just sneak around, the first week i only saw one   other person that lived up here other than my roommate who is strange himself as   previously noted, i feel compelled to change my major to pys so i can deconstruct   him and make him paranoid of the world, mostly cause of the whey protein   incident. grrr and he plays video games non fucking stop it's driving me insane,   and he's s junior. i t hought he was s freshman the way his mother was helping   move him in and such, my folks didn't even help me pack back at home, they said     see ya next weekend     we're coming down for the game'    i do'nt want to do my economics homework, so i'm doing this instead as a more   viable excuse than just sitting in front of the computer chatting and checking the   weather. leastwise i'm getting something done cause i won't be here thursday or   friday on account of me going to  a horse show in springfield ill. where i'll be   competing for 0 national championships and as i think in contention for both, so it   could potentially be a very good weekend. i'm also excited about seeing some   girl friends i haven't seen in a yr and i'm hoping they are equally excited, but we'll   see. and i hope our trainer doesn't mess the horse up before i show considering   i'll have zero practice because i show right after i fly in    speaking of flying i hope that planes will be in the air and a similar thing to last   year won't happen. we had to drive 00 hours as opposed to flying since all flights   were cancelled for an indetermined amount of time. and the show's bad timing of   starting on the 00th. and of course it's the same this yr too    i hate it when my brother's girlfriend tries to talk to me and i hate it when people   ask what i'm doing, if i'm on the computer i'm on the computer i'm not doing   anything elsewise i'd be out doing it. man coke is good, the beverage of course.   so much better than pepsi and r. c. and that ripp of stuff you get at supermarkets   that have stupid names. i hate pigeons  they really bother me   the seem so unclean  especially when you are swimmin in the pool and they are drinking and bathing in   the other side  i hate that  and those grackels they just look dirty and so annoying  but the squirrels are cool i've been tempted many a time to just grab one  but i think that wouldn't be wise especially since i don't plan on visiting the health   center any time soon, so i refrain, but it would be cool  especially to see all the out-there animal rights and weirdos faces, those people   drive me insane and all the christian rhetoric don't they have something better to   do than harrass me when i'm walking early in the morning or if i'm carrying   something the bastards set it on top, ggrrrrrr, very aggrivating, and the newspaper   what up with that if we want one we'll grab it ourselves, they'd probably get rid of   more that way because the second you call out to someone they instantly take a   defensive posture even if it is free. it's this damn culture of telemarketers and   wackos, you're constantly berrated to buy something or not buy something on   grounds that somebody else or something else will benefit, without regard to the   purchaser, but one day i hope to exploit that just like the other guy because with   the right mind set and marketing ploy people will buy anything you tell them to and   that my friend has been proved over and over again. . 
__label__label0 I am at work right now. I guess I'm a little hesitant about writing this   stream of consciousness, because we never do this in school.   We're always asked to write on a specific topic or something of that   sort, and to write what we think is such a broad topic. I'm sick, and I   don't think its because of those freshman jitters you were talking   about. I was completely confident in going to school. Nonetheless, I   got sick. . my parents say its because I don't have enough sleep or   because the dorms have diseases. I don't live in the dorm, though,   which is both a plus and a bad thing. I like living off campus,   because it feels more homey and seems like there's a place to get   away from school. Then again, a lot of my friends live on campus so   I don't necessarily get to hang out with them a lot. Its ok though,   because they always try to include me. Yesterday, I studied at ORGNAME   until midnight and my friend was so worried about me walking home   alone that she made these two guys walk home with us. I have bad   congestion and my mind seems like its under a lot of pressure, so if   I don't make sense, that is probably why. I'm listening to music   which seems kind of girly and I feel that the guy I work with might   think it is too, but he hasn't said anything. No matter what I do, I like   to have music on. when I sleep, when I study. Its a habit, I guess.   The main thing I have on my mind is successively passing my   classes. I have no doubt that I will pass. . but passing with A's is   another thing. I  am one of those girls who went through all 00 years   of basic schooling with all A's, and have never had a problem with   being behind in class or even worrying about getting a B. It might   seem like the work of a perfectionist, but  I wasn't always the most   studious. I'm quite the procrastinator. Ever since I started college,   however, it seems like I've had quite an interest in my classes and   studying. Of course, there's the occasional partying, but it seems   like college is an experience to do what you want to do. I like to   study and learn and feel as if I've accomplished something on my   own will. Its like reading. When I was little, I used to read a lot!  As   school started, they always made us read books, so I lost interest in   the joy of reading willingly. This past summer, I read Uncle PROPNAME's   Cabin and it was wonderful. It was probably the first book I read on   my own for awhile. When there's studying to do, and organizations   to participate in, there's no time for leisure time like reading or   watching TV. That is one thing I'm proud of since I've gotten here. I   haven't watched much TV. I wish I was more of a news-person, but   the news just doesn't catch my interest all that much. Its like   everyday there's another child missing or a new statistic that   everyone is obese. I guess shows like Dateline or 00/00 that show   the in-depth look at stories are more my style. We were told a story   in Mythology about how   people   used to have four legs and four   arms and two heads, and it was like they were connected by their   backs. Well, these 'people' became overly arrogant and so the gods   decided to split the two in half so there would be more of them and   they would be more efficient, and they wouldn't gloat so much. Then   they scattered the halves all around the world, and that is why we go   around searching for our other half. I like this story so much   because I'm a romantic. Hopeless romantic is more the term I   would use to describe myself. Even though I've been wonderfully   single for 00 years. . there's this hope that there will be a special   someone I will have sparks with and this higher connection to. I   don't know if I've watched too many movies or have too many   daydreams, but I guess I'm like most girls searching for their prince   charming. Sometimes I look into the atrological signs, of which I am   a Virgo. It usually always says that Virgos get bored quickly. I think   that in a way, I am that way. Its horrible to say, but I think I'll tire of   someone quickly if they don't keep my interest. Of course, I like to   keep everyone as friends, but romantically speaking, there has to be   something different about a person. There's a song by ORGNAME that   goes, 'I want to be like those girls in the movies, have a guy fall   hopelessly in love with me. '  Now, that seems kind of selfish, but to   know that a guy really cares about you and would sacrifice many   things for you is a really different characteristic. Guys nowadays are   so un-chivalrous. I feel like a little boy-crazy girl right now, but my   friend had mentioned that I should talk about this in my writing and I   guess it kind of stuck. Fortunately, I'm completely content with my   life and I feel that I have a lot going for me. I am not at all ashamed   of being single, but there's always those people who ask why there's   no guy in my life. What do I say to them?  I love being single.   There's those girls who go blind by love, and I hope to never lose   myself in the process of loving someone else. Its crazy.   
__label__label1      I am wondering how I am going to type because I do not type very well. I also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write/type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know?   today was the yr anniv of 0/00, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 00 as 0-0-0. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there.    i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her  we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves)  like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!!   i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing.  i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it?  i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so I always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i?   well i have about 0 min left, it wasn't that painful   i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 00 mins went by really quickly 00, 0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0 yea!!!!!  its over!  not bad, eh?  enjoy   
__label__label0 I have never had an asignment like this before. It is hot in my dorm room. I always feel sweaty especially at night. It is difficult to sleep. Now that we are a few weeks in to school I can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. The workload is quit large, and I never have enough time to do everything i need to do. Actually right now I am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. I know I won't do one of those three. I probably won't eat lunch. Even though I am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the OU game. The draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. If i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. I wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. We live in the same building and I still rarely see her. Usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. I miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. We both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 00 min a day left for just talking to each other. Hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. I live at PROPNAME so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. I am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. Plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. I wonder if that matters. I don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. I am serously considering not going to my next class. I just want to eat lunch and take a nap. I just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. Oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. Who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. During the last lecture i fell asleep for about 00 minutes and woke up really confused. I have so much work i have to get done before friday. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. My time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now. 
__label__label0 Gone with the wind I am and away I look out into the empty space of eternity with nothing. I awake into the morning darkness hearing the buzzing noises and look at thee ORGNAME ORGNAME alarm and press snooze while i squeeze in 0 hour of extra sleep. I watch tv and walk the whole day and then i go shit in my public restroom with feces flowing from my colon down to the toilet. Oh yeah i say as I struggle. I often have a tough time. No, i don't. I don't know why I am saying that. I brush my teeth and develop anger and excitement at the same time. Anger for what i ask to me as i am me but do not know who you are. Who are you and why do you exist i say? Then i look out the window and see big yellow neon lights expressing ORGNAME ORGNAME. I take a shower with no showerhead pressure and I get pissed off! I want nice warm water and a nice showerhead. The force is strong as I see red marks become apparent on my not so hairy chest. I get the urge for herbal essence but see to see that I do not have any. Do you have the urge to say   oh yes?   I am away and out of the blue and in the light of things there is nothing. Darkness exists as a prerequisite of life. What is this   doh   PROPNAME PROPNAME says. Donuts and coffee i must have soon. Soon enough to satisfy my craving for ORGNAME pancakes and a nice morning breakfeast at a nice restaurant. I go down the elevator. Stupid ignorant people who live on the first five floors are too lazy to walk down the stairs. I had a firedrill today. How annoying the pulsating noise was. And how tiring. I could not imagine how firefighters climbed up to 00 floors on that clear, but smoggy morning on September 00, 0000. My love for skyscrapers has grown more and more. Everyday, my passion and desire to see new and taller buildings arise grows larger and larger! I wait to see what will be done with the hollowed ground-zero. Perhaps nothing will be built, but i hope for something. Tennis is a very vigorous sport. The agility and the swift hits of the nice yellow ball that i throw around to my dog with. Oh I love my dog. Nice gold fur blows in the wind as i see a slow motion love seen in the mix of progress and then he starts to hump me. Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. but then he fell off. I forgot how the riddle goes. The itsy bitsy spider climbed up to window is it? Who cares? Not me, for I am no longer in kindergarten but in college, the LOCNAME's largest college-UT! WhoohooO! I have the urge to get drunk perhaps maybe have fucking good sex. Perhaps smoke something illegal or not? My room-mate has just farted and he says sorry. I don't care. The smell is of essence. Nice allure should be made into such a fragrance and entitled El Natura. Body works in different ways. My stomach is hurting. I have been having a bloating stomach the whole day. It is like a balloon filled not with oxygen, but with helium. If i could only float in the air and swim in the sea. Fly up in the air. Perhaps the ultimate luxury would be to eat tabasco flavored cheeze-its when I am perhaps   high   in the sky. Oh yeah. good 'ol times rock on forever. Forever i must live like that. Drunken little bastard i must be during this year. Ambitions thrive to do well, but will I? Parents constantly pester me with Do well in class viju-baba. Please do well. Of course the usual response is the usual for almost everyone else.  I will,   comes out of my mouth. Deep inside i have the heart to do whatever I want, but it is the concentration that I lack. I do not like being forced to do something that I do not agree with. It is simply at its upright most stupidity. Stupid is as stupid can be but who is stupider than stupid? Everyone is judged at different levels. Ignorance is bliss honey. Bee's fly around. I have never been stung by a bee or wasp. Speaking of being stung, I like the singer PROPNAME. He is a good singer. Anyways, speaking of other things, i think things are the way that things are and that things should be left to the way that things should be. WHY? because they are things that obey other things, not stuff. Yes. I need to pee, but must I? Flaming whopper commercial's thrive in the background of my head as i feel the urge for el penetrado. Oh yeah. The music is playing and I must go now. Bye bye and bye!         
__label__label1      I just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so I could read the things I need to read for my classes. The shower sure did wake me up! A girl living on my floor, whom I have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. So it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. This anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. So now I am here, listening to music and writing my   stream of consciousness   because I figured that this would be the best time since I have multiple feelings in me right now. In addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. He recently is   taking a break   with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. I told him,   yeah, I know what you mean. I had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual.  So instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. It took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. Talking about them just made me a little sad. Like I said, the break was really bad, so bad that I felt like there was no one who could understand what I was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. Strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. Anyway, I tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. If only I could help him out with his sadness, but I know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. A   break   from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. I am content that I have no one tying me down, but I do miss the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. If I do meet someone, then that is fine. If I do not, then that is fine too. When I entered college I promised myself that I would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. A huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. I have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud!   There are plenty of fish in the sea.  Yes, college is great so far; I recently joined kung fu. It feels so good to be doing something you love again. I had to quit due to, once again, strict parents, but now that I'm back in the sport, the stress is less. I love watching it, and there are really athletic people in the class too. Martial arts has always been a big interest to me. To be one of the few girls in the kung fu class is another bonus. Not only am I surrounded by athletic guys, I also feel like I am special in a way, like I am unique. And I am better than most of the guys already. Flexiblity and grace is key in wu shu kung fu, and I've got them both. 
__label__label1 I can't believe that I waited until the very last minute to do this. I've never beem so crazy stressed out of my mind ever in my life. I just couldn't find 00 minutes in the last seven days where I could just sit down when I wasn't totally fried. I hope that this dose not bode poorly for this semester. I think I can oull it out. This Festival I can't believe that Cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . Having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . I think I'm holding up but I feel that I coming apart now. I think that's what I scared about. This year I've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what I can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph I've learned so much. Mostly about what kind of person that I am. What am I capable of. Which is some great stuff. But I'm not there yet I 'm almost there though. It's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that I'm a T. A. or look to me for help. It's strange I guess people see good things in me. I like that annd I do the same thing. . I gues I'm just used to people being more aloof I hope that I'm not that way. some of the people that I have met at this festival have given me that instant companionship. That instant love and that's so great. . I guess when people are looking to me for answers  wheither it's about their cameras of their relationships I guess that means I'm becoming the type of person that I want to be. . That's a great reward in itself. I smoked again two nights ago. I have to stop after quitting for two years I can't fall of the wagon and go back to that. . It was only a few cigs (one fantastic PROPNAME PROPNAME MCD the very best) I can't let this girl. well she's not doing it really. I can't let the tantrum I'm throwing:) over this girl mess up what took a long time ito acheive I feel like a hypocrite when I smoke now. I don't know I just get lonely filled with self pity overwhelemed and I just want a catharsis. . smoking is sort of one. . I don't know I need ito stop again I don't think I 'll go back to the way it was but it's still scarey. I really think thigs are'nt as bad when I have a second to actually relax and evalute things I feel very good. . like the night before class tabling at the show I realized how many people I have met in the last year how many close friends that I'm making and have made and how important that I've become in certain peoples life and how much I'm going to be doing in the near future. It's all going to be worthwile I think I just feel impaitent it just seems like I've been waiting for ten years to get the chance to do what I want to do. what's going to be the best for me. and every BS class I have to take or everytime some jerk in Communications office is rude to me and everytime I'm treated crappy at work it's just one Bergman-esque humiliation after another. sometimes I hope that my   artistic spirit   doesn't die the death of a million pinpricks. . I really like this kind of writing it's been pretty theraputic, but I have to go

__label__label0      So here I sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is I'm really thinking, well. I'm thinking of days that seem so far from where I am, the hope of the past I guess you could say. I'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, I'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago,   what is your purpose for living?  . I told her I had none. That today I awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. This was a lie of course, I have purpose, a goal, just one that I am now comming to relize I can't reach. So what do I do?  I think thats what I'm think about most, what now. I'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and I wonder what story they have to tell. I need a cigeret. Hold on. God bless nicotine. It is wonderful drug. Many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am I going to do today about it, nothing. I can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. I'm considering what I should do about the Z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. God I hate her friends, and all there insocients and Nieveness, if thats a word. I really don't think I can handle there crap, and I deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly I don't know what to do. I'd like to go off on him tell him what I think of him and all his crap but I don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. I need to go buy books. But I probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. Anyway. So there I was in the mists of a great opertunity and I didn't let it pass me by and yet I'm still here. Whats up with that. What is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. A whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but I really don't feel like typing them. Ok. Now what. I see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do,   never felt so alone, never felt so alive.  but then again. But there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but I just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. A regular PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, no win sinerio. Well crap!   What to do. I have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. What to do?  Well there is always another option, a path less taken. Away out. I just don't see it, I need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. What to do?  Ok, best case sinerio I don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly I'll get shit. I do something and things are only worse. I leave, and I make everyone pissed. Give and I hurt, take and I hurt others, forget. If I could forget I think I would, but you know, that really never works for me. I can hide, I can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something I'm good at. I have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. So I go, I say hello, I leave. Thats what I'll do, and then, I'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. Ok so now what. I'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. I really don't have anything to say either. I mean really what is there to say, I'm sad, I'm not at the top of my game. But that will all change, and I think that frustrates me. That there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. Some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do I do to influence change, how do I minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally I'm very good at that, but lately, I guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how. But I see them in other peoples lives, maybe I've lost disipline, I let go for to long, and need to take up the  
__label__label0      I have just finished my first few days ORGNAME classes at ORGNAME ORGNAME. So far they all seem hard and I already have tons of projects, papers, and tests. I have gotten a chance to meet a lot of people. My roommates are all really nice and i enjoy hanging out with them. I also got the chance to join a sorority here. I think that will be a good way for me to meet some new people, expecially since I am from out of state. I can't believe how many people are from LOCNAME here. It is very uncommon for me to run into other out of state students. I am also interested in joining some other organizations on campus. I just don't know how much extra time I will have though. I am interested in playing club tennis, as well as doing some community service. The people who live out here all seem outgoing and friendly. I still miss my family and friends though. I normally don't even get homesick. I think going to a big college has many advantages. There are a lot of new people that you can meet, there are many good clubs, the athletic teams are really good, and much more. However, I think it is going to take me a while to get used to the huge classes. Also, the bookstore, ticket lines, and other things are very crowded. I think I will get used to it though. My major is undeclared. I can't decide what I want to do with myself. I am very interested in medicene, but I don't want to go through all of that school. It seems long and boring, and I don't even like science. I am trying to find jobs that seem fun and interesting, but it is hard to know what you want to do. I know that I don't want to sit in an office all day, and I like communicating with others. I also know that I don't want my life to revolve around my job. It seems like everyone has a major except me.   I met this really nice girl at orientation for ORGNAME. We already decided that we want to live together in an apartment next year. I am really excited to get out of the dorms, even though I have only been here for a week!    My best fried is coming out to LOCNAME to visit me in a month. I am really excited. I hope she likes it out here. She goes to ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME, and she loves it.   I think that I have a little cold/flu. My roommate has been sick and had to go to the doctor today to get medicene. My throat started to hurt and I have been coughing. I hope it doesn't get worse!  I normally don't get very sick, so this is kind of weird.   I went down to salt lake with some girls the other night and we had barbeque. It was the first time I have ever had texas barbeque. I didn't really like it, and everyone thought I was wierd because they all love it. I guess I am not used to it yet!  My favorite resteraunt in LOCNAME is ORGNAME ORGNAME. I have gone to it 0 times already since I have been here. It is so good. lettuce wraps, spring rolls, chicken, and fortune cookies!  YUM!  My roommate slept through her class today on accident. I hope that never happens to me. I am planning on going to all of my classes so I can keep a good GPA. It is very hard not to get distracted from school work in college though. It is wierd without my parents telling me to do my homework or to clean my room. But my roommate tells me to clean my room because she hates messy things. She is really nice though, so I respect her and keep my room very clean.   I am going to LOCNAME LOCNAME soon with one of my friends to see her house. I think it will be really fun. I have never been there. I wish my family were only an hour away sometimes. That would be nice if I get homesick or want a homecooked meal or something. I can't wait to go home for thanksgiving!  I will get to relax and sleep in my own bed!    Well, my time is up, but I am looking forward to a fun year! 
__label__label0      Right now I feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Last night I felt cranky and could not concentrate much. I think it had something to do with having two tests on a given thursday. My nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery. I noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as I walked to all of my classes. I thought that meant that there was high humidity or something. Possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat. I just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations. One for meningitis and the other for Hepetitus B. I felt worried about diseases when I arrived on campus. In addition to the worries, I obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that I get the shots. My left arm feels a little different than usual. The nurse warned me of possible side effects but I was not too worried about that because I do not have any known allergic reactions. I think I try to type faster than I am able to and because of it I seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often. I think that when I was learning how to type I emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy. My neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp. My lower back pain has been giving me some trouble. I remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine. I felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good. I came out to be that I had an extra lower back vertabrae. Not too rare but not particurally normal. My eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now. Ever since I started wearing contacts , for about 0 years now, I've been worried about the dryness, redness, and clarity of my eyes. I might need to use some eye drops now. I think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects. I usually don't think stuff like that will effect me directly. Although some things that i don't think effect me usually do. For instance when I got into my car crash about three months ago  I didn;t think that it would happen to me. My parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but I would usually ignore that fact that I'll end up in an accident. I wouldn't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful, but I would just let the message slide. I would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents. I should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment. I sometiems feel that people don't listen to thers anymore. they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications. Girls might do this more than guys. but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable. I would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems. It's not that bad but it;s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do. I crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes. I'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night. This is different though. I't what I say to myself. I wonder if that will ever be ignore. Probably not since it's not someone else controlling me but myself. Control is difficult to explain. I'm wondering when this will end. another minute or so. After a whild of this I started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not. I don't think i;m a fast typer or a good typer. Just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes. Less by looking at my fingers.  
__label__label1      I'm uncertain what to write, I can feel my unwashed body because I just woke up and i'm wondering how to put my words into the correct phrases and i'm focusing on how to follow my stream of thought, the refrigerator i had trouble spelling that word is making a blanked out for a second a very fuzzy kind of comforting machine noise everything is quiet kate is my roommate i feel like i have to explain it to you even though youre a computer or something a program i guess crap im digressing well shes asleep i didnt know that i had so much trouble typing when i was tired and what time is i don't know has it really only been 0 minutes or so what am i supposed to type about i think i'm stressing out scientolgists expelled me they told me i was too stressed i guess i am the stress test that was free my elbows are stiff went ballistic when i tried it only 0 minutes this is harder than i though stream of conscious makes me think of finnigans wake only 0 people in the world know exactly how to interpret finnigans wake its the hardest book in the world tim introduced that book to me he tried to read it stupid cheating bastard i hope language isnt a problem i curse but this is a school assignment grr i feel dumb and thats not good i shouldnt feel dumb neck is getting stiff i guess my train of thought is confusing who is going to read this and why and should i be using punctuation neil is asleep too i should eat my stomach grumbling breathing in and out this totally doesnt make sense what makes a really good stream of conscious writing i guess it doesnt matter thats not the point of this excercise i really like psychology its really interesting dumb scientologists told me that it was a overrated science and that more people were killed in the era that psychology was born i wonder if it was because more people were killed that psychology became more important i thought more peeps were killed because technology was greater potential to kill was greater scientologists are creepy they are so cultist i wonder if they are as brainwashed as i feel they are and im just rambling but i guess thats what we're supposed to do my hands are just doing what they normally do when they type i kind of am randomly putting punctuation does stream of conscious require punctuation? i hope not. this is getting rather tedious but i have to finish it my feel are getting cold and im getting kind of bored i think i should raise the blinds to let more sunlight in and put on a sweater the ac is really high in my room antartica aruna calls it i love aruna she's such a great sister is this a narrative or a record of my thoughts and feelings i feel like i should be telling about what i'm doing but maybe i should just put down what i'm thinking what am i thinking ear itches got to scratch it and my hands are like a separate entity they keep on continuously typing and my mind is just running in a completely different direction i guess it is easier to do this sort of thing online and on the computer if I was writing i would hate this it wouldnt flow as much wow so i think i'm lining up thoughts in my head to put down on paper is this what i do in essays maybe thats why my essays arent very great i don't really think them out i just blurt them out on to paper like i do in conversation thats a bad trait i type kind of fast how long is this supposed to be i'm glad i'm getting this down im curious as to what the results are and i really want to do well in this class its really cool too bad i had to sit in the very back last time i feel sort of like an outcast do i feel like an outcast in other situations i used to wanted to be a psychologists why did i decide against that again and am i getting down the connections of why i'm thinking this thought then that thought should i be writing that down that this makes me think of that and thats why i said this i guess thoughts just spontaneously came to my mind and i write them down maybe this makes me more impulsive in my regular life am i weird am i blanked out for a second i keep blocking out the sensation of my body except for the feeling of my elbows continously rubbing against the table the the palms of my hands against the keyboard crick in neck again i wonder if i have trouble studying because i get into uncomfortable positions and thats why i can't lose myself into the words on the text like i do when reading novels itd be interesting to hear or see other peoples stream of conscious writing if youre writing a novel in the stream of conscious way can you go back and edit it i guess so thats a dumb question its a novel meant to guide you through the stream of conscious not actually a stream of conscious writing thatd be messed up if you did a story i don't think i know what i'm trying to say next topic 00 minutes wow i didnt think time was flying by so fast 0tym with that song is good i wish i could understand korean good songs what does this stream of conscious say about me i keep shifting and my butt's going numb and little patches of skin are itchy i have to go at 0 to port aransas i hope its worth it i have a lot of catching up to do i had so much fun yesterday i wish that that could happen more often allen is awesome too bad soap operas and stuff happen too bad . i like both guys is that a problem who wants to hear about this not me, it's just a bad cycle of thought better think positively scientologists look all blank behind the eyes very creepy as if their cultish mindset has washed all personality way and they are all clones or machines programmed to thinki and persuade in a certain way that's too weird i can't believe i almost bought into it actually i can, i just want to be a better me who doesnt that   easy   solution they provide is really attractive if it works but look at them they are creepy and give me strange vibes only 0 more minutes yay i'm not depressed like they said that's really sad i just like to analyze and see why people do morbid bad things i just like listening and now i'm all defensive i shouldn't do that i have nothing to defend against no one is attacking me silly i'im just writing down my thoughts i guess that whole experience traumatized me and i have more stress because of it my hair is tickling me its so quiet i heard a door slam i wonder who that is i need to talk to more people on my wing i guess i can do that this weekend but i should really focus more on studying i have such a distracted personality but i guess i have charm so its okay thats what im told but what do i want ? i have to figure that out my legs are crossed it's a cool feeling but at the same time i can't hold that position for long my mind really makes some strange leaps but what about geniuses how do they think do their minds differ all that much? I wonder if they really have a different brain wave or patter oon 00 minutes ooh 00 seconds i'm almost through i wonder what they have to say this is exciting very cool very very cool i should have solved math equations that would have been cool but that's not the point of this i'm such a nerd do i FINISHED SWEET!! 
__label__label0 I don't know I fell kind of weird talking to a computer. Well today has been a really strange day. I didn't start school until 0pm so that was great. It lets me get lots of sleep. I think if I didn't get enough sleep I would be more stressed out then what I already am. Ok feeling weird again. I don't know what to type about. Ok, well yesterday I realized this guy that has three classes with me. So that is kind of cool. I went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes. We later found out we had another class together, Philosophy. It is such a big class, I was not surprised I never notice this guy was in my class. After that I went to read by Psychology book because I'm kind of behind on my reading. Today I finally caught up. I feel better in that sense, but I'm still behind in my other courses. It's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time. But I see other people and they seem to be doing less work then I am. They are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating. If none applies then I kind of feel sorry for them. This weekend I finally get to go home. I'm kind of happy to go back because I miss my baby sister. She is like one year old, so I hate to miss her growing up. She is really funny and I love her a lot. When I'm at home she follows me everywhere. As for my parents I miss them too, buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them. More stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress. "  I love my parents and all, but I like living on my one; well kind of, still have a roommate. When I go back home I get preferred treatment. This is because my parents miss me a lot. I'm actually not that home struck, I don't find it too difficult to live afar. I think this is partially because I know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away. I do feel sad that I'm not spending time with my family though. In this sense I feel inhumane, because I made the final choice of coming to LOCNAME. Well it seems like half my time is over and I am starting to run out of mind speech. Ok, I'm just typing to type. Well, then that water bottle looks really good about now. I actually find college possible as long as I find time to study. That is the hard part because I spend most of my time walking from class to class, cleaning my room, doing laundry, taking a shower, eating, or just relaxing for a moment. There are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time. It's kind of aggravating but I guess that's just the way life is. I guess someday I'll get to rejoice in all that I have accomplished in the far future. I am scared of failure, but I deal with it. It's not the end of the world. I like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else I will use it as an excuse to not do something. I think Psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific. I was like wow, I remember reading about that but don't exactly remember the detail to answer the question. That is another thing I am afraid of. Not being capable to learn all the stuff I need too. I know that if I gave myself enough time, like years I could definitely remember the details. But in the allotted time I have to learn all this information, along with other classes, just thinking about it makes my head hurt. I can't picture myself learning every single thing the book has. Especially when I have 0 books, and I have to learn almost all the information in all the books. Yeah, well I got my head hurting again. One good side is that this typing thing is almost over and I can continue studying. Although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life, this is what actually goes on in my head all the time. Especially the headache part. I think one of my major weaknesses is my English. Basically I learned English from tv because no one at my house spoke it. I guess my first language was Spanish, until I began watching tv and understood it. I hate having weak English skills though because I always below average. I guess its the one thing I'll never be good at. 
__label__label0 so I don't really know what to type about. I hope this does not have to be like grammatically correct or anything because I don't ever use capital letters. twenty minutes is a really long time. I don't know if I can even type that lone. I don't know if I ever have in my entire life without stopping or taking a break. is weird to write down what I'm thinking because I think I try to think about what to write so I'm not completely sure this is really what I'm thinking. I hope no one reads this too carefully. so its always been really cold in my room but now its kind of hot. I think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings. I keep thinking about kurt and I wonder if I should call him back or not. everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but I don't even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did. I think my foot is falling asleep. I almost wish I had a desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small. my hand keeps hitting the mouse while I type and it waves around in front of what I'm writing and that makes it hard to concentrate. anyways, I don't want kurt to think that I have been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first a pop up just came up on my screen. I didn't think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp. ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and I didn't want to because with all my pop ups I figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so I tried to push the little x in the corner and it wouldn't close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work. at first I thought it was for this maybe it was but then I got back to this screen and my time was starting all over. that sucks. I hope this is over soon. anyways I'm still thinking about kurt. no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together. he could just want to talk. he did say the first time that he just called to see how I have been. and I'm still mad at him for what he did but I do want to forgive him because I just don't want something like that hanging over me forever and I hate to hold grudges. and I do want us to be friends and I know it would be hard for me to say I didn't want him back but even if that is what he wanted I wouldn't do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me. plus I'm in college and I don't need to have a boyfriend back home. I need to meet people. but I really do miss him a lot. I hope it gets easier. which is part of why I will call him because I really need to close that part of my life and end it and I can't think of the word but something like finalize it. I hope my battery does not die on my laptop and I hope that another popup does not come and mess up my time again because I really need to get this done. I have a lot to do today. but I'm glad I got done what I did this morning. I need to find out about the whole football ticket draw thing. and I hope I wrote down in my planner about that trig review class. then I have all those small chores that I have to do tonight but I don't think ill have time especially since this is taking so long. I have never experienced a longer twenty minutes than this in my life. at least I should be improving my typing skills. I hope it rains this weekend or even today. no maybe tomorrow because ill be outside today. I can't wait until it get cooler outside so I can walk places. yeah right like I really will but maybe I really will. I have taken the stairs up to my room a few times. I think I may fall asleep after this or maybe even right now. I need to move my leg this hurts. wow I'm really really sleepy o I also need to remember to call joey back tonight before I call back kurt. I feel so bad I hope he is not mad at me for ditching them but I needed to go out with christi because we hadn't really done anything together. and I'm glad I did because that was a lot of fun. but I do hope he is not mad or anything and we can get together later. I wonder if I should join the texas exes. I don't know if this is really what I'm thinking because I know in the back of my head all I'm really thinking about is how much I hate typing all this and how I can't wait until its over but at least I'm doing it today instead of tomorrow night so ill have it done and don't have to worry about it. I'm going to try and not procrastinate. bad start though I'm only on chapter one in psychology those chapters are so long and boring I hate that book. I hope this does not deduct points. I wonder if I should stop now since that pop up messed up my timer. oh well I only have about four minutes left anyways so I might as well keep going. o I need to go tanning tonight too. ahhhh I have so much to do tonight and most of it involves reading that damn psychology book o and I have to read that philosophy book. I really like my schedule how it is though that is nice that I don't have any real classes today so I can get caught up. yay I'm almost finished good because I'm really sleepy now and I want to take a nap even though there is no way that I really have time for that but maybe I will anyways just like a few minutes to rest my eyes yeah right ill fall asleep and probably won't wake up until like nine or ten I spell out numbers because I don't know what keys to use yay I'm finished 
__label__label0 I wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 00 degrees in my room. I had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and I'm generally a hot natured person. The thought of winter coming makes me really excited. I like summer, but it just stays too hot. Maybe I should have gone to college in LOCNAME or somewhere a lot cooler. I don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. I'm just always hot. I get it from my dad, he is the same way. We are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. PROPNAME was another person I could do that with, but I never see him anymore. He should come down and visit, I know he likes it in LOCNAME. I am surprised that I am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. I don't even live in the same town anymore, I'm 0 and a half hours away, why does it matter. Maybe if I had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, I wouldn't care as much. So far, I have been really disappointed with the college parties I have been to. They are nothing like the ones on TV, which I know TV isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). I almost wish I hadn't brought my TV, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. I need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. I would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so I might as well make myself as popular as possible here. The more people you know the better off you are. If that's true, I'm in trouble. The friends that I had down here before I moved are still my friends, but I want to find my own group. I feel welcome among my other friends, but I don't feel at home. I have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. The FIG is stupid. When I signed up for it, the only reason I did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. Now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. There is one girl in there I'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. I tell myself I'm going to talk to people when I sit next to them in class, but every time I end up convincing myself not to. In my hometown of PROPNAME, LOCNAME, there were about 000 students in my high school, so I knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. Now I'm going to a school of over 00,000 students. No one would even know if I didn't show up for a month. In PROPNAME, I'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. Fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. I sometimes just watch the clock when I'm bored, like in church. This weekend will be the best one so far. I am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. Plus, I want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that I find attractive. I'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. Dress to impress. I never go out looking worse than I want people to see me as. It's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. I am nothing special here. There is nothing that I can do, or that I know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. That has been a really humbling experience. 
__label__label1 English is my second language. probably I'll have a few grammar mistakes and phrases that don't make sense. I've just watched a really good movie, it's one of those movies that really keeps you thinking. but anyways I don't want to talk about that. I don't know what to talk about. I'm having lots of reading, I chose lots of reading subjects, but I'll be able to handle it. it's just a matter of organizing correctly my time. the more busy I am, the better my academic results are. it has always been like that. if I have lots of things to do I organize my time better than just sitting there in front of the tv. doing practically nothing. I love that though but I prefer being busy and having lots of responsibilities. This semester I'm not only taking 00 hours per week but I'm also in a student organization, in belly dance class, in intramural soccer besides from adapting to this new university-freshman idea. I like this task. it seems pretty pointless and useless but I like writing whatever. in french it would be best defined as N'importe quoi. I love LOCNAME. I really miss that country but I don't think I'll ever live there again. I don't know why I have this strange feeling that I'll stay here in the LOCNAME. I don't really want to but I know that I'll end up finding a tempting work here. I'll marry a guy from here as well. I don't know it's just this sixth sense I have. but life gives many turns. life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you'll get. hehehehe. PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wonder what PROPNAME PROPNAME is doing right now. his last movie was a couple of years ago. is he doing a new one or is it just that he has retired and is dedicated to profit of what his career has left him? My mother, she might be thinking a lot about me. I know she misses me but at the same time, she is really happy to know that I'm here. following my dreams". PROPNAME. when will I'll be able to dump him? It's just something extremely difficult. I'm used to his weekly calls and although I don't love him, I like having someone thinking of me. I want a boy in LOCNAME. I need a guy. I like compromises and being with someone. life turns easier when you have a boyfriend. don't you think? I realize that I'm a very dependent person. not on my family or my friends but on men. or a man at least. if I were a man, I would have my own harem and I would be surrounded by them. sounds pretty cool uh? I think that in a future life I will be an extremist feminist (if you understood that title!) and I will fight for women's rights. not in this life. (it's one of this strange feelings I get) but in a future life. In this life, I'm going to dedicate myself to succeed in life. what is success for me? It has something to do with PRESTIGE-POWER-MONEY. I am someone who qualifies for those 0 things. I will get them. I'm an ambitious person. I end up getting what I want. we'll see, we never know. life is like a piano. depends on how you play it. I am all philosophical today with this box of chocolates, and the piano and this superficial phrases that are very commercial but are always useful when you can't explain something. like RELIGION. Holy sake! What a complicate thing that is! How many wars and deaths that usually brings?! What a stupid thing. like today 0-00 I think a lot about that and about PROPNAME as well but whatever, religion is the opium of the masses. another commercial phrase but very very true. PROPNAME and his communism! That was about it for tonight. I have to continue reading PROPNAME and his political system for my Quiz. my life is being reduced to reading and reading and reading. but I like it, as I said (and this is to emphasize it) I LIKE HAVING RESPONSABILITIES. 
__label__label1 Well, I am just sitting here and listening to a cd, The Wallflowers Bringing Down the Horse. It is a great cd and classic rock and it kinda of makes me feel old because the cd came out in 0000. My roommate is here in the room with me talking to a friend on the phone. This song definitely reminds me of middle school. It makes me what to sing along. I am kinda of feeling lazy I don't know what it is about thursday but I already start to think is the weekend. I do have a lot to do though I need to read for my Mexican American Studies and biology. I already have a biology test next friday and I am getting a little anxious about the first test. It is hard to know what to expect from a professor until you take the first test. It is starting to get a bit cold in my room I guess I'll put on my sweatshirt. I need to make a grocery list so I can go to the grocery store tomorrow. I need to call my mom also and my friend PROPNAME who lives in LOCNAME I haven't been able to get a hold of him he is really busy with school. He just started his masters in music. I need to take out the trash it is starting to smell funny and I need to clean the bathroom it is my turn this week. I am thinking about what to get my mom for her birthday and what to get my parents for their 00th anniversary. I wonder when it is going to get cooler the hot weather is starting to get on my nerves the humidity is unbearable. I wonder if it is actually going to rain today because all week long the weather people have been saying it is going to rain and then it never does. That is quite annoying yeay I am half way done with this writing assignment. ouch I just bit my lip I always chew my gum too fast. wow this twenty minutes is going by a bit slow. I want to see a movie this weekend but I am not quite sure what I want to see I better go online later to see what has come out this week. My roommate just asked me for some bread so she can make a sandwich because the cafeteria is already closed and she doesn't want to use what limited bevo bucks we do have.   
__label__label0 My suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. I really should go to bed so I won't be tired in the morning, but I want to get this done so I don't have to worry about it later. The tag on my shirt itches. I need to cut it off. My suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. My roommate is studying still. Someone just slammed a door down the hall. My suitemates are being loud again. My back kind of hurts. It must be from carrying my backpack around all day. I'm really tired. At least I don't have class until 00 in the morning. I'll get a little more sleep. I need to remember to go to the Co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. I bet I'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. I should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. She asked me why I had to type for twenty minutes. I've only been typing for 0 minutes! My suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. My feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. I hope I do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. I studied all my notes and read the chapters. I'm getting sleepier, but I have to finish this. They're being loud again. They are loud a lot. I think the second night I was here, they came in at 0:00 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. Me and my roommate are quiet. Someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. I think it was PROPNAME, but it may have been PROPNAME. I can't tell their voices apart yet. I think PROPNAME is the one with a job at Footlocker. My roommate is popping her knuckles. I pop mine a lot. I need to stop. Everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. I don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. I just popped my knuckles out of habit. Someone just slammed a door again. Everyone always slams doors. Maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. I only have five minutes left. That's good because I think my roommate is done studying for the evening. Now she is typing on her computer and laughing. She must be IMing someone. It is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME, or maybe it is her friend PROPNAME that I met the other day. I wonder who's online that I can talk to right now. Probably no one. I need to go to bed anyway. I'm glad I gat my Calculus homework done. I got a 00 on it, so I'm pretty happy. That's good considering I didn't get any help on it. I need to find a study group for Calculus. I probably need them for all my classes. My roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. I said yes. They do go out a lot. I don't think I've ever seen them study. My friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. I wonder how they are going to pass their classes. I'm almost done. I only have 00 more seconds. Then I get to go to bed. Good night! 
__label__label0 so what do I think about for twenty minutes. I don't really know. it's different when you actually have to think about what you're thinking about. my feet are cold. which is so weird because my room is always hot! We really need to get that fan that we talked about. I wish I was home; I was always the right temperature at home. and if I wasn't I could just change it. oh well I'll be home at the end of this week. I hope steffie is feeling better and not having too hard of a time with classes. I haven't talked to nick since I've been gone; I wonder if he even misses me. probably not so much since he just started middle school and he is making all new friends. how come I haven't made all new friends? maybe I should have gone to a smaller college. I dunno, I just wish I wasn't here. seeing javi this weekend was great, but as much as I try to tell myself that I should be happy that I at least got to see him, I can't get rid of this hollow feeling. I think I've sighed in the past two and half weeks than I have in my entire life. but honestly, what will I tell mom and dad. I know that they support me but how am I going to say that after three weeks somewhere, I'm so unhappy and I just want to be somewhere else, preferably in oklahoma. I dunno, maybe I should just wait. it has only been three weeks, and you knew that you were a shy person. but eventually you'll start making friends like at home. I just wish I wasn't sad all the time. it makes me feel like I need to talk to dad about medicine again. I'm so sad. I hate it here. I just want to go back to normal. no matter what I do, like swimming the other day with jacob and alex. that was kinda cool, but I was still only mildly entertained. and as far as studying, I've always liked it, but now I depend on it way too much to keep me busy. oh yeah, I can't forget to go by the library today and ask for a job. if I don't get that done, it'll keep bothering me until I do. hopefully they'll have openings, because that would be the ideal place for me to work, I think. haha, everyone would laugh at me though. how perfect. PROPNAME, working in a library. whatever, it sounds cool to me. my birthday. I wonder if we're going to have time to celebrate it this weekend. I hope Lee'or doesn't mind that I didn't call her. I should have called PROPNAME PROPNAME back so that I could wish Lee'or good luck. oh well, she was getting married; I'm sure that she was so happy that she didn't even stop to think about it. I wonder what javi's doing right now. I    'm so glad he came this weekend. it was the best feeling. but then again, would it be worth it to change schools. I mean everyone is so pessimistic about this sort of stuff. should I even listen to them? I mean everyone said just break up before you leave. long distance doesn't work, but both javi and I ere so miserable. it caused more problems then staying together will. but I know what mom and dad would say. especially dad. he wants me to do well with business so badly. he is so proud. but I don't even want to do business! but then again, I dunno what exactly I want to do. except be with javi and start having some fun with this whole college" experience that everyone raves about. so far, I'm a little disappointed. but I guess that's a little of my fault because all my motivation seems to have disappeared. except for good ol' school. at least I can judge that. I can't let them slip. my grades are what I can use to persuade my parents. that I at least tried the whole business thing, whatever. but now I'd rather do something interesting. ugh! business! yes, it's great. I got into UT business. wow! but if I can't even get excited about going to class, how am I going to get excited about getting up everyday of my life to do financial reports and stuff. oh blah! how boriiiinnngggg! how boring, how boring. but isn't that just perfect as well- I'm stuck between doing what I know is logically best and what I feel like doing. hmm, yeah, there are a lot of things on my mind. I always seemed a little stressed in high school. just trying to balance everything, but at least I had fun. I think if I were another person I probably wouldn't want to get to know me now either. despite the fact that I could get down before, I never doubted that overall, I was happy. now I just feel lonely. haha. maybe I should stop listening to coldplay. rush always said their music always makes someone sad. but I dunno, I really like the piano. and plus I have so many good memories from that one cd. I just need to listen to some more upbeat music I guess. maybe some  
__label__label1 Okay so I'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and I see trees and squirrels and birds. I really like my dorm because when I walk outside to go to class. I always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe I should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute. I'm trying to think what I've done today because I feel like I'm wasting the day away. I woke up at about 00:00 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed. We all went to Subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 00 minutes. I came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves. Her boyfriend broke up with her 0 days ago and she definitely isn't being the sweetest person. She is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me, she freaks out. I think she is jealous. but what is there to be jealous of? It's not like I have a wonderful boyfriend. My ex boyfriend. PROPNAME. he goes to ORGNAME because he didn't get into UT. He will be here in a year. Well. he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk. I feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems. Hmmm. well basically he (PROPNAME) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him. We were together for almost 0 years. Well I told him we might be able to get back together but really I have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to UT and by then hopefully I will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him. I love him still and it frustrates me. College frustrates me right now. I always had a lot of work in high school so I am used to the work load but I am just boggled down with things to do. Like laundry. And sorority crap that is pointless. We had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and I skipped out on it. I feel guilty" but then I don't. I didn't see the point in spending the night at the Chi-O house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 00 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at Scottish Rite. I don't think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever. OH well. what can I do? Nothing. I miss my friends. HMMMMM. I never thought I would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so I could escape from all the petty college stuff. like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking (seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting "wasted". It's like the girls in my dorm (which is an all girls dorm) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they've experienced "Frat Parties" they can't get enough. Don't get me wrong. I love partying and the occasional wild nights but then I also believe that frat parties get old. On a different topic. I have a bunch of homework to do. At least I'm getting this done and I'm enjoying it at the moment. It's very relaxing. typing whatever I want. Not having a strict curriculum to follow. I wish I could meet some guys that aren't just interested in sex. That grosses me out. Look. my thoughts are running rampant. But then I also miss things with PROPNAME. But then I don't miss PROPNAME because I'm in LOCNAME. doing whatever I want. in the heart of the city, but then I stayed home last night . a Saturday night and I was in bed. I guess I'm some sort of loser. I almost feel like if I don't party every single night I am like the biggest LOSER UT has ever seen. I need to separate myself from all this Greek B. S. Hmmm. you know what else I need to do. laundry. read Pyschology. Calculus Homework. That's another thing that worries me. The difficulty of my Calculus class. I have already found a tutor and I'm having mass problems with the homework. Oh well. I'll get through it somehow right? I have tutoring tonight at 0. Isn't this little story of my life so interesting. I need like 0 boyfriends at one time like my friend PROPNAME or like 00 activities to do at one time like my friend PROPNAME. No I really don't need to deal with that stuff actually. I have problems enough worrying about what I should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my Calculus homework will take me (probably 0 hours). WONDERFUL. So much to look forward to. so little time. I need to relax. I need a back massage. I need my mom's cooking and my own bathroom. I won't be getting those things for a long LOOONG time. I have no plans on going home. If I go home my curfew will be midnight. Funny how the parties in Austin don't actually start till midnight. Oh another thing. I hope I make good grades to make my mom happy. She seriously is worried about me and my grades. She probably thinks I'm partying so much which is not the case at all. I think I actually am in my dorm too much. Wait. she is going to get mad because I went shopping and used her credit card. OH LORD. I'll be getting a call in a couple weeks. "LINDSEY. what is this ARDEN B store on my credit card bill? AND why did you spend [ ] amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways?" Oh no. Well I have been doing this for 00 min and 00 seconds and it went by pretty fast. And I'm sure whoever reads this will be like "what is this girl talking about?" but that's okay because I'm sure there's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment #0's. Well my 00 min are up and I am closing this lovely "stream of consciousness" with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch. ?You will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her. She was made to be wooed and won by youth. ?    ~PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label1 I don't really know what I want to write about. I am about to start watching football. I used to like pro football a lot more, but now I really just don't care. I would much rather watch college that pro. I am downloading some music right now. I am ready for this paper to be done so that I can go and watch some football. I hope that this class isn't too hard. I don't want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major. When I was walking to class today I was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier. But it will be ok, I'm just going to have to study. The other reason that I don't like that class is that I don't know anyone so everyday I come in a couple minutes before class starts and I sit down. And the only talking that I do is small-talk with someone that I don't know. That gets old after awhile, saying the same thing over and over again. IT's always what classes are you in and how's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing. It just gets really old. 00 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock. I am ready for the weekend to start. Football weekends are the best. This weekends tailgate is going to be a blast. There are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling. This is getting old, because I'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and I am about to fight him. He keeps on laughing at me and I don't like it. Here's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder. He is not as much of a prick as the other one. I don't want to fight him right now. HE just walked out of the room. My other suitemate hasn't walked in yet. He probably won't. He is pretty weird. He sits in his room and plays video games most of the day. Other than that he just spaces out and watched tv. He doesn't party either. I feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff. I think he knows one person up here. But they don't really go out and that is no fun because I know that he is not having a good time up here. But maybe this is just the normal thing for him. He doesn't seem like he was a real social person in high school. I only have 0 minutes of typing left here so then I will be done and be happy. I'm listening to some new austin music right now. This paper is almost done, so I am happy. My friend just told me that his dad drinks o'douls, that would not be fun. My dad drinks real beer. Now my paper is done. 
__label__label0 Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the ORGNAME, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 00 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 00 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From ORGNAME's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which PROPNAME said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 00 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that ORGNAME Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if ORGNAME put out programs on ORGNAME's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 0 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach PROPNAME. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     PROPNAME -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with PROPNAME again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 00 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (0 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 00 real" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 0 seconds. So for every "real" minute, 00 seconds go by. So in a 00 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 00 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 00:00 when I started, and now it is     00:00 and I still have 0 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my "0" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. 
__label__label1 I hear nicole's printer printing I'm so glad she is my roommate I really like the song that's playing on the radio I wonder if my laundry is ready yet paul is a big poo face I wonder if I should tell hijm about my date with PROPNAMEh on friday it's under the table I don't think that I'm very good at this stream of consciousness thing I have to look at the keys when I type on it's kinda annoying I wonder if the professor takes off for stupid internet phrases like lol or kinda man I really can't stand paul I hope that zac doesn't turn out to be someone who's just looking to be laid this assignment seems like it'll be really easy someone just popped up on I'm I wonder if it was dylan I'm supposed to go to a concert with him on friday but zac and I were supposed to go out then I wonder what it would be like to live in austin for all your life new braunfels really sucks at some points in time right no my stomach feels kinda weird probably fro the spaghetti I ate at dinner and nicole's macaroni she htes macaroni cause she got a noodle caught in her throat one time which reminds me of the time I got a peppermint caught in my throat ooh walking on sunshine by reel big fish it reminds me of warped tour with dylan kelly and I don't remember who else went but it probably wasn't that important oh it was ronnie now it's going to be  me dylan paul patrick PROPNAME PROPNAME and james and nick all going to static x and staind in october, I'm really excited about it but kinda scared I'm walking on sunshine my feet hurt from the shoes I was wearing today I love them, they're converse sneakers so cute and they look like they would be comfortable but they're really not which is kinda disappointing rambling like this makes me feel like anne hathaway on princes diareis which makes me think of her in the other side of heaven which is one of my favorite movies nicole and I watched josie and the pussycats last week at some point in time I wonder what mark will think once I tell him that I have a date if I even bother to tell him I already told ward, I think that ward may like me but probably not and don't it feel good? I dig this song, we sang it in choir in sixth grade which brings back memories of casey and how we were the best of friends up until a stupid boy came between us I can hear the air conditioner going and the clicking of nicole's mouse she is doing a cog lab for some reason she is upset that she scored against the norm on it I think that she is really smart and am glad that she and I are roomies it was weird though cause I was in here while she and greg her boyfriend were cuddling she has a question for me but can't remember it I suppose I'll pay attention she did an experiment and has to print it out and it has to be the final name it seems like it should be daniell instead of nicole wow it's only been seven minutes and I'm running out of things to think about well if it's saved under that name um perhaps you should talk to greg about it I think she is oops I didn't realize she was on the phone I miss dancing and am kinda nervous about trying out for the roustabouts I think they're called my hair is tickling my nose I wish that I'd never had bangs to begin with it seems like such a hassle to take care of them and it's taking so long to grow them out nicole is trying to get greg to help her with her computer stuff over the phone he will probably end up coming up here and then I'll have to go down and hang out with ward and mark in my pjs to avoid  feeling awkward if nicole and greg start getting touchy feely I think that he is going to come up I'm glad that they've worked everything out now but it kinda makes me depressed because I don't really have anybody and paul is being a big poo head which is his new name poo head paul. I wonder if punctuation and capitalization and spelling count in this probably not because it's not like humans think using punctuation or caps I like the punk version of this song punk rock princes by something corporate dylan went to see them with 000 last week I wish that I hyad gone now but I haven't even started my biology questions yet and I'm afraid of failing the course and am considering dropping it my tailbone kinda hurts from sitting here so long I don't think that I want to be on AIM when paul gets back I should leave a message up on friday saying that I've gone on a date it should pose for some interesting conversation with him later on that's for sure geez 00 minutes that means that I've still got 0 to go my alarm should go off when it's been that long my laundry is probably already done I'm glad nicole showed me how because I had neglected it for so long we talked to a cool guy in there but I forgot what his name was he was a business major though I wonder  what the weather would be like tomorrow hah nicole said anal and she is talking about laura vasquez a girl from our old high school I think I saw ben campos in my psych class today but it's been so long since I've seen him and think that I keep seeing people who aren't really the people I'm thinking of so it might not have been him I really would not like to see any of them though I came up here to get away from them but oh well, c'est la vie and cool sheep tiffany laughed at that phrase earlier I just don't like beans enough to say cool beans sheep are so much better I feel like a child babbling on and on to an uncaring adult and my time is almost up so that's a good thing I think I've already been through four sogs already nicole's kinda computer illiterate though she did learn how to download stuff from her camera to computer which is more than I can probably figure out I'm thinking about my psych class now and the huge screens used to project the stuff I expected everything to be without overheads or any sort of indication on what we should write down it being all us and sucks for us if we don't know what to study for the test I really should do my biology but I'm not in the mood I keep saying that I'll do it later but honestly it won't get done I think that I say the word honestly too often and I make too many typos when I type I really like my laptop keyboard though the keys are nice and compact and make cool noises when you press them rather than nicole's chunky computer keyboard but what would you give away to have somewhere to go to I don't think that I would give up everything for just one other person though the bible says so which reminds me that I should probably e-mail my bible study instructor christie later on tonight just to let her know what is going on her kids go to school in austin jon and katie they're really cute christie and her husband got divorced a while ago and it seems like a horrible thing that they went through I don't really want to ask her about it though cause it's not my business and it seems like a touchy subject  which brings to mind richard who called paul a dick after I told him that paul had told me that he kissed jade I think I'm getting better at accepting the fact that they're together at least it's easier to do up here than in NB it seems that the further away from my problems I am the easier they become to handle I wonder how many other people are doing their assignments today my alarm just went off and it scared the crap out of me I'll have to go get my laundry after I'm done maybe I'll try out my new iron and ironing boars are we supposed to  
__label__label1 Right now I'm thinking what I am going to write about. I am so tired and so ready for this weekend. I just worked four or five days straight and now I get the whole weekend off. So I am so excited, yet so exhausted. School is fun yet is hard to keep up with all the readings for every class all the time. I don't know if I doing anything right or not. If I actually understand what each class is going to be like or if I will succeed in every class. Tomorrow I have a full day off with only two classes and the rest of the evening to do whatever. FINALLY a night to do whatever I want to and enjoy the college life and atmosphere. Explore what ORGNAME has to offer. I need to talk to my teacher that I am an aide for by next Wednesday, when am I going to have time to talk to her throughout my busy schedule. All the books piling up on my bed. things I need to get done today or at least by this weekend so that I am caught up for classes next week. Finally next weekend I will be abl0e to go home. able to see all of my friends that I have not seen in probably 0 months. I am trying to be as quiet as possible so that my roommate can study and do whatever she is doing without me bothering her. I need to go shopping for some food for my dorm so that I actually have something to eat. Guess I'll probably go there tomorrow and find things that I will need and also eat. What am I going to do this weekend with all the stuff going on in austin. am I going to stay here or should I head back home? what should I do. Guess I'll see what I feel like this when this weekend comes. Gosh. I wish this time would be almost up so that I can get on to studying for my classes that I actually have tomorrow. I have so much to do yet so little time. Hmmmm. this pink lemonade that I made is kinda tangy, maybe needs some more water. I just feel like I have so much energy right now that I could do anything. I need to make some calls to the people I have not talked to in a while and just catch up on everything that is going on. my ffet are cold. guess I better go put on some socks. my ass is also getting kinda sore from sitting on this hard wooden chair that the dorms provide. I probably need to get a pillow so that I can sit here longer. dang my room also needs to be cleaned. it seems like the dust takes only a couple of seconds to land and make everything look dirty. the blue rug sure is starting to look sad. guess I need to go borrow the vacuum cleaner downstairs so that I can get it looking better. the room also feels like it is getting colder. I sure need to go shopping. sooon. but I have no money. I need to get some money from my parents. how I sure do miss having them around and having everything paid for. the room is so bland and plain. the green ugly tack board thing could use some decoration. I wish people wouldn't have to come see my room on Friday. maybe I won't be here when they come or maybe I might make it a point not to be here since at least my side looks pretty drab. my biology book is sure bigger sitting on the shelf than I realized. I sure need to catch up in that class since I really don't like biology. next friday when I get out of class I need to have my stuff packed up so right after I can head home. I can go visiting and then go to homecoming to see everyone. I don't think I will stay long, because I might feel awkward being in college and going to a high school football game. People might look at me weird. I don't like when people stare at me. I need to sign and fill out this form for my nursing class, it will be due pretty soon. I just don't feel like doing any of it. what should I do this weekend. Its so confusing. what should I do. Wow. I didn't realize all the room that I still have left on my shelves, I can still store a lot of more stuff on them. I sure have not played a game lately. I wish I could find someone that knows how to play dominoes, I really wan tot play dominoes with my brand new ones. I'm getting so bored, wandering around the room trying to think about other things that I need to get done, abll the stuff to do and so little amount of time to do it. 
__label__label1 Wow, that clock starts right off the bat. I always get nervous when things are timed, even if they're not important. Dangerous liaison. " I like that PROPNAME PROPNAME song, its really fun and catchy. The stations here play really different music on the the same station, when they say "mix", they really mean it. They don't mix things up like that on LOCNAME stations. They should its really fun to hear all this stuff without having to get up and change the station. I'm tired. Going to the gym really wears me out. OOO Fastball, I love this song, its so old, but I forget the name of the song. I need to start remembering to bring change to the gym so I can get a locker there, hold all my stuff really gets annoying. Especially when you're riding the bike or something and there's no place to put your cd player and your keys and the screen on the bike keeps demanding for you to "steady hands on sensors" in order to read your heart rate. Sometimes you just don't care what your heart rate is because you're tired of holding your hands in the same position for 00 minutes, but if you dare to take your hands off it flashes that message and sometimes beeps at you threatening to end your turn and start the time all over again. I really hate those dang sensors. Yeah, I know they're habitual to stare at while your working out, but they really frustrate me. Yesterday, the reading was wrong, saying my heart rate was only 000, that is not even my heart rate when I first get on the thing. I was tempted to go get on another machine but I had waited in line forever for that machine, so I just tried not to let it bother me the whole time I was on it. But I guess it did because I'm still thinking about it today. Commercial, commercial, commercial, I don't care about the sale at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't like that store, they play elevator music in there. I felt bad for my friends who worked there, having to listen to that while they worked, plus they said the pay was not that great. But I guess you get used to it, they plated easy listening at the steakhouse I used to work at, by the end of the night, I was singing along with all the songs while rolling silverware. You would be oh so happy whenever christmas rolled around and they played something different, plus I just love christmas music, its so happy and light. I could sing jingle bells any time, its great! that and that sleigh bell song, I can't remember its name though. 
__label__label1 Today I felt very happy. This morning at church I felt more comfortable becuase it was more traditional to me. I guess after my youth back at my hometown that's all I like. My stomach hurts a little right now, as much as I eat I don't know why I keep losing weight. Last night was our date with PROPNAME and ORGNAME, it didn't go as planned, at least for me. I don't know what the deal is, but my luck with women is just not the best. Man, those little granola bars are the best, the one I ate with my salad today. I'm thinking about talking to that girl in the cafeteria. She is 00 I think, but then again, age is only a number in college. In college it doesn't feel like I'm classified anymore, it's just that I'm an adult now. Since I've been here, I miss my family, but I haven't gotten homesick. Traffic here is horrible, it's to fast. I want to see that new movie PROPNAME v. s. PROPNAME. I don't know why but I read that this girl wasn't into scary movies. It's dark outside, I think I'm going to go run after this. Well the Titans v. s. Raiders game is on. I went to PROPNAME's house yesterday to go watch all the football games that went on for college. Hopefully I don't get challenged for beating PROPNAME and PROPNAME at ORGNAME. That referee has an anoying voice. I ate a cookies and cream Ice Cream bar, it was pretty good. My roommate is laying down. I don't know why it seems he doesn't have as much school work as I do. I type pretty fast for a guy. I really need to get that program for my computer with Power point and all. Right now I'm looking at a picture of my family and pet's. I think I have to have the best parent's ever, I mean, if it weren't for them I wouldn't be here right now. I kind of want to here some PROPNAME PROPNAME. This guy said he french kiss a french woman. Kinda funny. This weekend we went to PROPNAME's, met up with PROPNAME, couldn't get a wristband. My printer is so slow, it's loud also. My fingers are kind of cramping and I still have 00 minutes left. There is a little running icon on the left of my screen. The sky looks awesome right now, it's like the sun just passed the horizon. I got back in at 0 a. m. last night. I was pretty tired, I ate a pop tart before I went to bed. I don't know why, but I knew I shouldn't have ate but I was hungry. I always think to myself If you just sleep through it, you won't be hungry" I talked to PROPNAME today, she is pretty hot. I think she has a boyfriend back in her hometown. Speaking of which, why is everyone going back home? They just got here. I know if I went to Tech I wouldn't be going home all the time. I keep hearing a little bit of words from the TV  and it said " the crowd is loud " and "another flag down " PROPNAME note says, Aug 00 FIG meeting. Our FIG supervisor is pretty hot also. She is a sophomore, so maybe I could talk to her too. Next week we play arkansas. I remember one time at Tech during my athletic training for ORGNAME, I thought I was in a tornado. PROPNAME was eating pizza that night. A bright neon light. I hope that this test doesn't say that I think about food to much, I've said something about food like 0 times. I used to be a big guy, 000 lbs. Now I'm down to 000. I feel better, just not sculpted. I'm kinda nervous to go to LOCNAME gym to go join a rec sport. I'm not sure how it works and I don't have the money to just throw up in the air. Hey, I just looked away from the computer for once. Right now as I type I'm looking at all the wires on the floor. That could start a fire. Nah, the papers are not close enough. That didn't make sense. I have this candle from initiation the other night. I kept it because I like keeping sentimental. I also collect coca cola bottles. I gave up cokes like a year ago. I think this whole year I might of had 00 cokes all together. That's healthy. Especially here, all you can do is sweat here, I hate it. The trash can is fully, I threw it yesterday but I forgot to put a bag in it. I hear someone passing outside. You know, sometimes I drift away from my mind set when I drive. It's like I don't remember how I was driving from point A to point B. It's kind of hard to explain. It usually happens when I have a millions things running through my head. Internet globe. That recycling commercial keeps coming on that bad ass station. 00. 0. Love. My mom loves me, she wants to send me money for my birthday next week. Wow, the big 00. I'm getting old, only 0 more years and all will be good. Something I've waited for in awhile. My grandparent's. God bless their souls. I miss them so much. Love you Grandma and Grandpa!         
__label__label0 Well, first I'm thinking that I should've done this a few days ago instead of on the last day. There are still a few hours left, but it's never good to procrastinate. I guess it's ok because I've been very busy lately doing work for other classes. I'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 0th street and getting drunk, which is what I thought I was supposed to be doing. Some of my friends call me a hermit" now because I'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times. I don't really care. I'd rather be responsible. I do go out though. Yesterday I went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game. Now I'm feeling full and satisfied because I just ate a pizza and I was extremely hungry. I haven't felt this satisfied in a while. I don't really like most of the food in the cafeteria, but the pizza is good. I miss the food at home. I miss home a lot. I miss my family even though I talk to them over the phone just about every day. It's just not the same when you are away. Life at home this summer was so simple. I was just in my house very comfortable and without worries. I would go out with my girlfriend every few days. I miss her desperately. I think I was supposed to also describe what I'm smelling. I don't really smell anything right now. I wish I could smell my girlfriend's perfume again. I think that's my favorite smell of all. It's weird because I sometimes "remember" what the scent was. I don't think that's supposed to happen. Now I'm thinking that I've been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired. Oh well. It's in the name of science. Now I'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this. I feel sorry for whoever has that job. Sorry for writing this much. Sorry for not being very interesting. Now I'm remembering that I missed the rain again. I missed yesterday's rain because I was in my psychology class. When I got out, the ground was wet. It happened again today on the count of my pre cal class. Now I'm thinking that I probably should've done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because I think there should be a timer above this box thingy. Now I don't know when to stop. I'm probably going to stop too soon. I'll get an F in this assignment. I'll fail this class and be dropped. Then I won't be considered a full time student because I'm only taking 00 hours. I'll be forced to go home, and I will go home a failure. Hmm. that probably won't happen. After all, I've been having so much here, even though it is away from all that I hold dear. I think I have 00 more minutes to go. Now I'm feeling that I have to go take a leak. Dammit. It'll have to wait. I'm still not sure what this is for and what it studies. Maybe someone will read this and say that I'm crazy. That would be funny. All I need is confirmation. Now I'm thinking that my time would be better spent outside. Outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy. A very pretty day. I hate being inside. I'd much rather be outside. I have a good view of the outside from my window. I'm on the seventh floor so it's pretty cool. I think I'm doing this wrong. I'm still not sure why. I think my time is coming running out. Yup, I'm done. 
__label__label1 First of all I really need to use the restroom but I also need to finish this. I've actually been thinking about this-whoa look at that timer- this experiment I don't really agree with because I am an awful typist and a perfectionist which makes this sort of painful. I am going to use this time as uh um um time to meditate. I needed  to do this monday- that psy webpage- oh I listening to everything its amazing -I keep on hearing my roommate peck at her computer-my sense are keen at this time because I just am hearing everything- this experiment is scary. I don't think I would feel comfortable if thoughts of sex or murder came into my head. I have trouble being blunt with God, how could I tell you. Who is you? That sounds like some black talk with makes me think of linguistics I love linguistic- PROPNAME in my office was the first I think I should change his name- PROPNAME in my office was the first to mention the stream of consciousness I was at a black poetry I got really mad because no one got there on time African American History. the light on my charger is red no, it green this experiment is longing my thoughts while I think so I have in essence to streams of consciousness- no I'm probably wrong. I felt like am in a mirror and another one is behind me and what you see- Is another ending process- my mind is so physical not in the sense of I like to look at hot boys but it just - am getting tired of-there is goes again that stupid delete- I was scratching my head now my neck itches. I guess this experiment is not so weird after all it is kind of like me. I never feel like I am living my like I think its because I am so analytical. that period and I an that an word I spelled wrong-I am getting on my own nerves can I please just spell. I am taking a breath when I'm not perfect I cause myself stress. I got sad last year when I finally found out that I was not perfect. I am looking into the computer as if I will remember that moment I sound like I am in a movie, so poetic, I am scrounding up my nose. I have a snob nose some people think it is cute. the question of beauty since I am doing this exercise for a minute I'm not going to care if I type right because I have to work On being perfect knoe one can be pertaect  that is only a bplare for Goreds hs is the perfect one I feel soreey Okay the message just came back up I don't have to type so bad now. My physically feels heavy why does feel and physically sound alike? My my teeth taste salty I ate some how do you spell pretzels I think the imprint of the desk is in my arms. I just scratched my head I wonder what kind of people go after the 00 minutes, nerds sick demented people I no that can't be the case then I would fall into that category and I can't have that even though I feel like a nerd. People tell me I am pretty, but down inside I feel Like a nerd. This reminds me of that ORGNAME will anybody every read this e-mail does it really even matter. I want to go back to my movie but I am being pulled lead in another direction. Hopefully it is God. I need God the time is 0:00 pero mi clock is fast a couple of minutes. I quit in essence monday. I wouldn't just walk away I gave my boss notice that the weight of school and job are too much. I really want to focus I my life with God Life with God what does that mean. I am ready to know God. I am happy for the things He gives me pero I desire him more than the things I think that is maturity when children start to think what they can so for their parents instead of vice versus I this experiment has revealed in me my fear I leaving this world without an impact. I not trying to confess fear. Just want to know I guess my life meant something. I hope this class will bring my closer to God. I just got to belief that what I feel is just more than chemicals in my brain. I am ending it here though I am tempted to write a song. though I have never written a some I have put down- PROPNAME PROPNAME- I have to read her poems she seems like a shady character. what can I say of her character I didn't or don't even know her. Ok Ok goodbye     
__label__label1 Ready, set, go. Wow, my grammar has gotten pretty bad. I wonder if this thing has, I hate these stupid pop ups, spell check. I just woke up, feel pretty worthless. Saw PROPNAME PROPNAME played to the Wizard of Oz last night pretty cool probably cooler if I was stoned. Only been stoned once before, didn't like it, no desire to do it again. I'm a beer girl. Need to work out, clothes don't fit as well as they use to. PROPNAME won't like that. I'm glad PROPNAME is coming this weekend I hope she has fun. I really miss my family, I hope my sister can can, Fuck these pop ups, come up next weekend for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't know where anyone went, they're probably eating lunch. Damn, 00 more minutes, I don't really know what else to write about, maybe or is maybe if I turn on some music. This is one of my favorite songs, I like it better than the original, I think it was remade for Good Will Hunting, it makes me feel so. I don't know, introspective. Bad word, but can't think of anything else. I love words, probably the only reason I did well on the SAT. Damn I'm still so tired, don't know why, must have slept for at least twelve hours. I think I might be getting sick. Spring break best vacation of my whole life, some of my favorite memories. Memories are an odd thing. I wonder why you remember the things you do. Walked into the ORGNAME building the other day and the smell of it-deja vu-it was such an odd feeling, and I can't quite pin point what it reminded me of. I wish I knew. LOCNAME vu is such a weird thing I knew more about it- what triggers it and everything, maybe some day. 
__label__label0 Ah! 0secs! O no 00 sec! er. er. what am I supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi PROPNAME! er. talking to PROPNAME. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. Ah! 0min 00 sec! hang up PROPNAME! hang up! eeek. panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam. Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when PROPNAME called to remind me. Hm. I should start studying right after I finish this. I got to get more organized and responsible. I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. I wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. I think it's called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. reminds me of Fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. I miss something. I don't know what. I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day. I wonder how college is like for her in ORGNAME, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am I talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. I wonder. don't know what I'm wondering, PROPNAME's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? I don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. I miss hugging her. I feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in LOCNAME. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like PROPNAME but not as short as most guys nowadays. 00 min. I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. I've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 00 min. hm. :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out. I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why. should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't sleep well. never could. wish I could. then I could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by PROPNAME PROPNAME. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 00 sec left. I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot. I wonder how my sister is. I want to go to a party. and meet more people. I wonder how PROPNAME is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. PROPNAME is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like Grace and PROPNAME and some other friends. I think I'm getting better at talking. I want to get smarter. I feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. I like to dream. I'm ambitious. is that bad or good? I have no idea. 
__label__label0 I've never sat here like this before and jotted down my thoughts. Despite them being my thoughts, I don't think much about them. Every time I hear my roommate, PROPNAME, play the saxophone, I think of my brother PROPNAME back at home. (I thought of this because he is practicing on it now. )  School. This year I'm trying to make straight A's because I crashed and burned my 0st two semesters. Some say it wasn't really a crash and burn. I received a 0. 0 PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME's definitely not what I was aiming at. I don't know what's wrong though. I set aside a lot of time to study, but I could just never pull through on tests. Some people suggested I have ADD. I always think about whether or not I have ADD. I've usually dismiss the possibility that I do, because that might be just the easy" way out. What if it's not ADD?  Just me having bad study habits. I don't know. I always worry about school. 'm going to see a counselor about it. Crew. I can't wait 'till tomorrow morning. We have another practice with Texas Rowing Crew bright and early in the morning. 0:00 practice that is. I found seven people that are trying out for crew too that are living in my apartment complex. In one building over no less. Heather just left. I just got back from dropping her off. Heather's my girlfriend of 0 yrs going on 0. She plays goaltender on the ORGNAME ORGNAME girls soccer team and is having a tournament in LOCNAME for the weekend, getting back late Sunday night. PROPNAME stopped, and is now watching television in the living room. I think that is one reason I can hardly get any studying done in this apartment. There are too many distractions. Plus my bed is so comfortable. Having to wake up so early sort of makes me tired. I learned today that people with a regular sleep cycle tend to have better concentrations than do people with a sporadic sleep cycle. That's what I have. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I wake up at 0:00 and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, I wake up at 0:00. I never gave much attention to my sleeping habits, but now I'm taking a study strategies course that is hopefully going to help me make better grades. I want to make straight A's this semester because in doing so, it will raise my G. P. A. to a 0. 0. Still no where near where I want to be, but its a start in the right direction. 00 more minutes. Speaking of sleepiness, I am feeling very, very sleepy right now. My eyes are getting heavy and my head is tilting. But I'm fighting it because I am in the middle of an assignment. I just looked at Professor PROPNAME's old tests and I do not remember going over some of those things in the book or in lecture. I hope that there was a different curriculum last year. Psychology is the only class I'm all too worried about. I feel like I have no control in this class. I feel like this class overburdens me. I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 0 classes. I'm a 00 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes. I'm getting even more and more tired than ever. I will definitely nap after this writing assignment. My glasses are bothering me and my throat is so dry. My brain is going on hold for a second as I take a swig of water. Ok. I bought one of those Nalgene water bottles. What's the deal with those anyway?  They make them so expensive, and I see everybody has one. So, naturally, I had to get one for myself. Two more minutes. I am counting down this assignment to be over because I'm just that tired. I am assuming their will be some sort of punishment to press the finish button early, so I stop myself from doing that. Wow, 00 seconds. I am very ready to take a nap. 00 seconds. Almost there. Man, I'm going to have to get PROPNAME to shut that TV up when I  
__label__label0 My roommate just had a sandwich from subway, and the smell is killing me. It's one of my favorite things to eat. He gets somewhat annoying, though. Right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up. I don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight. I hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good. Everything I am saying sounds really stupid. I guess that's how the mind works though. I've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts. Most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts. He (my roommate) keeps talking to his game. It's getting old. The game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive. It even gets a little scary at night some of the time. Nights are so weird here. It always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough. I always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time I remember it's too late to be calling the east coast. I don't know where my relationship with her is going. We've been dating for almost four years. Maybe I should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying. Would that offend him though?  I don't know. I don't know about a lot of things. And I just realized that I just used the word don't know. "  The internet lingo is getting out of hand. I used to be online almost all day long. He is still talking. At least I can look forward to the game this weekend. For once I won't mind the noise. It's kind of exciting. My first LOCNAME game. I am so bored. I really need to meet people. Being from out-of-state definitely has its downside. Everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much. It seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what I have to do or I'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room. That, my friend, was a run off sentence, but I'm much too lazy to correct it right now. Stayed up too late last night because I don't have any classes today. I should really finish my homework after this, but I am way too lazy for that. There it goes. My roommate made me lose where I was going with that last thought. I'm kind of thirsty right now, I should get a bottle of water. The Austin water is gross. I'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it. We've been buying water left and right. We should really get a ORGNAME filter. This game really is addicting. I just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 00 seconds. I don't think that it's a good thing to do that. This whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references. My 00th grade english (is that supposed to be capitalized) would murder me if she knew I was writing like this, but I suppose it is okay as long as I don't get into the habit of writing this way. I am really slack. I'm only taking 00 hours this semester and I still don't do any homework. At least I am doing okay on my graded assignments. Oh well. This is college life and for once I'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work. The timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before. Just like when I'm running; it always takes so much longer for 00 minutes to pass when I'm on one the treadmill. Very dull, indeed. 
__label__label0 It's kind of weird writing about what I am thinking of right now this moment. there is not clear direction what I want to write about. I hope my english is good enough to make a sense to my TAs. well, I am really hungry right now. Maybe I should ask Bora to go to LOCNAME with me and have dinner. I just love that place. I think it is the best fast restaurant in LOCNAME. Well I did remember seeing the news column with PROPNAME is voted as the best Fast Restaurant. " I think it was the LOCNAME local newspaper, because I can not remember the name of the newspaper. By the way I really should start reading the newspaper more. well I wonder if Doctor PROPNAME is gay or not. He really is funny guy, but today's outfit really was more like cloths that gay people would wear. I really think that he need a exercise. He can loose weight around his stomach. Well I really shouldn't criticizes him with the weight because I know that I really really really and seriously need to loose a lot of weight. I should start swimming again. And bring my old swimming suit from home. I can not believe that I forgot to bring it to school. I really want to go home. I wonder why mom told me not to come home this weekend. I know that I need to find the ride and everything. but This sunday is her birthday and coming up monday is unni's birthday too. I wonder "Don't come home honey. It's too much trouble to you. " means like " Oh yeah come home!" kind of deal. sometimes I don't really understand her. I hope I would not be like that. well this time thing is really going to slower then I thought. I should have ate first. Man I have only dome 00 min. umm now 00min. ha ha. yeah just 0 more minutes. well let's see. I should be worried about the psy class too. Man the class is too long to stay a wake. and chapters are too long. I feel like I'm reading the whole new different language. but It is fun. I wonder how tough his test is. man I really do need to catch on the reading. (I really will go read after chipolet if you are reading this. ^_~)         Let's see what else am I thinking right now. I really can not think of it any more. Ahhh man this pop-up ads. why can they just leave me a lone. I mean really nobody reads the whole think. man that must be the PROPNAME. Boyfriend of my roommate. they are just cute couple. 
__label__label1 I am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to ORGNAME channel. It's playing justin timberlake song. I just got back from my biochemistry I class and the professor in that class seems very boring. I noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because I feel like I missed a lot of what he said while I was taking notes. I can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time. I feel I'm more of a single tasked person. Besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and I can hear it's boiling right now and I think I need to check on it before the water boils over. I'll be back. Well, I'm back. This week will be a tiring week for me since I have so much to catch up with anthropology reading. I pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means I have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks. My other teachers are okay and I seem to absorb a lot in their lectures. I don't think I can work out much this week and I maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday. Plans for weekends are unsure since I haven't made any. Hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to. I had already met some people in my dorm, but I haven't really met people in my classes. I also met the people from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and I don't think I can usher again in the football for the Longhorn PRe-Pharmacy since I haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago. I hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible. It's unexpected that somehow right now I feel more energetic than when I was about an hour ago when I was in biochemistry class. Maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that I ate about 0 hours ago now is starting kick in. Something about the song in ORGNAME just made me looked at the screen. It's PROPNAME PROPNAME in a Japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because I am from an asian culture. In LOCNAME, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often. As I'm watching a fighting scene in that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I think LOCNAME has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art. Instead, we have other things. I don't feel like listing  them right now. It's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows LOCNAME is diverse and multi culture. Speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture. I have a lot to read on The Forest People, who are people have very different culture from Western and Eastern culture. The book is  
__label__label1 I'm really tired of studying. I hope this doesn't take long. Man I want some water. Will this thing know if I leave? I sure wish PROPNAME would call. I miss her so much. Or maybe I want PROPNAME to call. Or PROPNAME. Or PROPNAME. Who do I want to call? Too many girls, this school is going to get me into trouble. I hope I get all my homework done tonight. So I can have a social life this weekend. It would be nice to relax for once. Not have to carry a book everywhere. I felt so stupid reading at the football game at halftime. But we have so much work. I'm just not used to this. I'll get it done, I have to. I need to get a 0. 0 this year. So I can get into that damn business school. Why does it have to be so hard? I see stupid people all the time who are business majors. I'm smart, why can't they let me in? PROPNAME, its only been five and half minutes? This is going to take forever. Lets see what other h. w I have. Summary of the readings, due tomorrow. Catch up on chapters in Art History. Take a nap. yea right. I wish I knew what sleep was. And I have to go see PROPNAME tonight. Hopefully that is a cool symbol. I wonder who is going to read this? I'm sorry your having to read this. We must be very boring people. I hope you get what your looking for. I sure wish I was in your position, then I wouldn't have to sturdy so damn much for this class. I don't understand DR. PROPNAME at all. I enjoy listening, but as I write, I fail to comprehend. And as I comprehend, I fail to write it down. Which is more important? And the text book. Ohh My God. The most interesting part, was the story about the black guy getting shot by the cops on page 0. At least it had a little drama. Like on TV. Damn I wonder what is on TV right now. 0:00. I don't have a clue. Not used to the channels down here yet. And ohhh wait, I wouldn't have time to watch TV anyway, with all the work. Damn, I'm thirsty. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I almost killed him for setting off that alarm on his truck in the middle of the night. Well not really, but I was upset. I need my sleep. I don't have time to be jumping out of bed, to see why there are blaring horns. I need to learn how to spell. I'm retarded. I need sleep. Damn A Nap Sounds Good. 0 more minutes until Nap time. yea right. 0 more minutes until I read some more. Why has no one called me. I know PROPNAME won't call. God forbid you call your ex boyfriend back. What we can't be friends? I miss her so much too. PROPNAME is perfect. but PROPNAME was perfect for me. No one treated me better then her. Too bad she is 0 hours away. but worth the drive. At least its not 0 states like PROPNAME. Won't be seeing her any time soon. I want to go see her so bad though. I know she needs me to be there for her. She is so fragile right now. PROPNAME will be ok. But I really need her to be there for me. Or maybe I just need someone to be there. I can't stand this being alone. Girls only want one thing here. to not have a boyfriend. Just have fun, 00-0. I miss having a real girlfriend. PROPNAME made me so happy. I want that so bad. PROPNAME can't be that for me unless I move. I got to figure this shit out. damn did I write all this. I have issues. whooaaa hoooaaaa. I wonder if there are any parties this weekend. I wish I could go. But Ill probably just hear about them next week. Ohh well, Back to studying. Bye Bye reader. Until Next Time I love that symbol. 
__label__label1 Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. PROPNAME PROPNAME is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from LOCNAME. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at LOCNAME about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to PROPNAME n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 00!" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 00 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 0 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 00 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week. 
__label__label0 I am so cold right now, and I want to take a really long nap. I have so many things to do and I don't know where to start. I miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. I don't know if I like the whole idea of growing up. Sometimes I wish I could be a kid forever. My roommate can sometimes become annoying and I just want to scream. My suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. I really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. The cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. I had the best ice cream the other day at LOCNAME LOCNAME. It was cake batter flavor. Crazy ,huh?  I am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. I am now happy to be in the school of education. So many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. But I am glad that I have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what I truly would love to be. I think I need to take a shower. I want to have a family when I am older and I can't wait to get married and have kids. Someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. Our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. I've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and I hope to build some very good friendships here in college. I tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. I play with my hair a lot and as a result I need to get my hair trimmed. People think it is ridiculous but I have done it since I was a child. I had a conflict with my sister this weekend. I hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. She is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. I think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement" in college which she did not take advantage off. It's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. I hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on Friday. I really need one and hate relying on someone else's. I wish I was able to pay for it but right now I am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. My mom is the greatest mom there ever was. She would do anything for me. anything. I wish that her and my dad were closer though. When I was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. I really hope that I can plan a trip to go on for Spring Break with my boyfriend. I have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. I wonder if my friend martin from LOCNAME is going to email me back. I haven't heard from him in awhile but I think sometimes he behaves in ways that I would not tolerate. I wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. I guess I need to buy a new blade. My little sister is painting her wall with a mural of LOCNAME LOCNAME city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but I don't know about that. My mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but I think she should be a little more realistic. I really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where I can actually move around. I really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. I am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes I worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. I really could see us getting married but I guess I should leave that to God, if you know what I mean. I love pizza an ice cream. I wish they weren't so fattening. I need to go kickbox this week. It's not the same here as it is at 00 hour fitness. It's cool though. good exercise. I'm really tired of typing. I got to go tan outside today. 
__label__label0 Ok, well here we are. Typing away at our writing assignment. YAY! I hope I'm doing this right. The TV. is really distracting me right now. Not so much that I can't type, but I keep thinking about PROPNAME PROPNAME. I love that guy. He's tall. Tall I sure as hell am not tall. That's a shame too, I could have a good tall guy. GEEZE, it's only been two minutes. This sucks. Now, now, give it a chance. I hate you. Shut up. Ok so lets see here. I like apple sauce. Definitely going to have me some apple sauce as soon as am done with this assignment. I have a giant jar of apple sauce sitting in my frig. Hate people. They're so stupid. I hate the way they act and treat others. Ah. I'm rambling, stop it. Ok lets see, I like toys. Toys are fun. I remember the good old days when Christmas was all about the toys. Now Christmas sucks. I hate Christmas so much. I hate the way we have to spend time with the family, I hate all the cheery people, and I hate how everyone is happier than me. I mean if people would just concentrate on . I hate my roommate. Always drinking my water. Why must he touch my stuff without asking. Sorry he just walked in and I remembered that he took my water bottle. ORGNAME, where was I, Christmas blows! It's just I think people have forgot the real me, I just saw some breast on the TV. and now I've lost tract of what I was saying. Ah yes, Christmas angers me. It's just that people, I think, celebrate jolly old saint PROPNAME and the bright lights and trees, more than the birth of PROPNAME. I'm sorry know I'm watching ROCKY IV on TV. I love rocky, he's amazing. I even named my dog Rocky in honor of Sly. Wow not even ten minutes. Well I'm just saying I'd be happier with Christmas if people just went to church all day on Christmas than celebrate ORGNAME Crap. Oh no, I'm talking to myself again, blast I hate when I do that. PROPNAME PROPNAME, sorry, it's a line in Rocky IV. Favorite line in ROCKY IV, "Age before beauty," as Apollo Creed lets Rocky, fucking roommate took my boxers. Sorry I just pressed enter as if I was sending a message on instant messi, how do you spell messenger, oh there we go. It's just he was shopping for boxers, and I found a pair that I liked and then. we weren't shopping alone, we had to girls with us, (just for the record. ) anyways, what, ah I liked a pair and. wait, I think I'm screwing up the assignment. QUICK ding dong the witch is dead, the witch is dead. I'm tired and I'm really really dumb. Hi my name is the undead and I like sleeping. ok lost train of thought there. hmmmmmmm, pizza rolls. I smell pizza rolls because my roommate just made some, probably mine that he stole, fucking ass. I want to be an actor. I love that they made five Rockys, I wish I had an accent, like a scottish or german one. The word Finish looks German. I tried learning German, FOR THAT FUCKING WHORE!!!!!!! I hate everything. Especially her. Not really, I actually love her(possibly), I just grrr. , hate that time of my life. I wish I was six feet tall, that would be badass. Hot, now there's a funny word, sorry I just heard the word hot on TV. Now Lacrosse, there's a fun sport. I hope I get to play sometime , fucking roommate always distracting me. NO NO, he cool, it's just I. Get back on tract. School is very educational to me. I like it. Now drugs are bad, very very bad. I got to start eating better, much better. LOCNAME, almost done. I'm not even sure what I've written about, but you know what, it doesn't matter, because I own shit and I run shit. Peace 
__label__label0 Ok so I am writing about my thinking. Well tonight was interesting. I had a great time at the LOCNAME LOCNAME meeting. PROPNAME was really sweet I hope that I will get to know her better. I wonder who my big sister will be in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Hmm interesting. I love big sisters in organizations. Which is kind of crazy because I just talked to my big sister from the drill team I was a part of in high school. Random. Even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me. I promise when I have kids they will never be more than like three years apart. I can't believe that in ten years I will probably be married with kids and all that. Oh my gosh. Where has the time gone? I am actually excited about being a mom. My mom was amazing. She may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her. No one can argue like her that's for sure. I miss her. But I will see her this weekend. I can't believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game. It is crazy. I can't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home. Which is totally crazy. I never thought I would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast. But I guess that is a good thing. I will be here for four years so I should probably make it feel like home. So now that my boyfriend calls I am thinking about him. I can't believe I am doing this whole long distance relationship thing. It is the hardest thing in the world. I miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late October. I wonder if we will make it. I know we can but it is so crazy. Four years of being six hours apart. I wonder what we would be like married. It would be amazing to be his wife. He is the most amazing guy I have ever known. Everything I could ask for he has. But still I get scared sometimes. I wish I could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him. I guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away. I also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which wouldn't be good for either of us. I believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if I had him there with me all the time. Anyways wow it is already eleven. I really like this song. I had never really listened to PROPNAME PROPNAME but it is very relaxing. I wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now I like this one too. It kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why I like it so much. I wish we had a TV though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger. Which is great but I don't know whatever. Tomorrow is Thursday. I don't really like Thursdays. My classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok I guess. I had a lot of homework for tomorrow. College is a lot different than high school in workload. Like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy. I guess its good that I am typically an overachiever. Well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me. But whatever. I hope tomorrow goes by fast. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go out on a boat. That is going to be so much fun and then Saturday is the football game. I can't wait for that. I have never been to a ORGNAME game so it is definitely going to be an experience. Wow it has been twenty minutes. I guess I am done. Ok bye. 
__label__label1 Yeah so I am so stressed right now and I am wishing that I wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress. I could get FAT!!! I don't want to be fat. I mean I know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! Right?!?!? But I am trying to run a lot!!!! That way, I can burn stress and burn calories. EXTRA CALORIES!!! I am having a hard time not getting irritated when I eat a lot. that's weird huh!? That it's when I am hungry that I'm not most irritable. hmmmm well Today when I went running, I realized that I should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when I'm tight. and get this! I've lost 0 lbs since I got to school. But How?!?!? I've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! Oh well. Still I was kind of excited! But I am mad that I haven't started my period yet. My mood swings are terrible and so are again. My eating patterns! And that's when I find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something I don't like. SPANISH!!! UGH! I want to move to LOCNAME and learn it by living with people who speak it! But I really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows English so she is slow to interpret and yet teach. Does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh I've heard that word before. and oh I know what it means! Poof! I mean we have to LEARN something before we can know it. Did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her Mother's womb. NO! She was pottied trained. RIGHT! Well My high school Spanish teacher was horrible and I had the worst experience with that . while I got a great grade, I didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! I mean I am glad I got an A but she didn't prepare me for LOCNAME where my prof speaks in SPANISH all the time. not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! Would I say to a baby. Ok this is how you open your mouth. open it open it. Do you know what I am saying?!?! It kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak English well. they aren't trying to be mean but they may say "HEY HOW ARE YOU" really loudly and you're like "Dude, they aren't deaf! They just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone" Right?!?! grr. So I feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like "MAN this girl is so negative!" Golly, I am right now because I see my Spanish prof EVERYDAY! like I said before. so yeah! uhhhhh well I am excited about this weekend but at the same time I keep thinking of how behind I am compared to everyone else here at LOCNAME, intellectually and academically! I mean I feel so insignificant some times. However I know where I get my wisdom from and that is PROPNAME PROPNAME who makes my knowing God possible! He saved me from the depths of HELL! And even after doubting him so much and having to research PROPNAME' life and creation and all that. I have found that He is the one . He is my sufficiency! I mean who knows more than the God of the universe, the creator of the heavens and I am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly Mentally, emotionally, Spiritually, and Intellectually! I mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the God that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 00 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) There is just so much opposition to him right now. I mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death. well actually God let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but I just want everyone else to know his love and I really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a "bible beating" manner but just to love them through how I treat them. Hopefully. I wasn't too negative for . you know what I'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this. PLEASE LOOK FOR JESUS WITH THE PRE_SUPPOSITIONS that he doesn't exist. expect to find him and I know you will! To his glory alone!  
__label__label1 ok so I'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again I love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking. so this is kind of fun. I just wish that my strep throat/tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (Thursday) I can do well in the challenge. and so that I can play well for the clarinet sectional Friday night, because I need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, I haven't memorized all of it yet. I guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) I was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't I love watching. I really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because I feel like I'm a cheap addition to the band. like I wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that I'm good enough because I'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. I feel bad for thinking this but I kind of want PROPNAME's knee to keep him from marching on Saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. I don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 0th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because I put some pants on. do I smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good. Maybe PROPNAME and I shouldn't leave the towels over the vent. even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through. Oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its January, not September! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome. I was warm the entire night, and when I got hot I just kicked the covers off until I got cold. I guess the fact that I was wearing his pajama pants helped. no nothing happened. he's a really good guy. A Christian. his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex. it has to deal with a unicorn. Yeah I wont go into details. but it proves that he's a good guy. not to mention I spent both Friday and Saturday nights at his place. he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks I trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'. if only he knew me better, he would know that I'm VERY skeptical with guys. especially after so many of them lying to me. I'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so I basically play hard to get. I don't think id consider it that, but I don't go easy on them. I'm not the stupid blonde you think I am. I really wish I was one or two steps up on the ladder. my whole life I felt like I wasn't quite good enough. I never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at LOCNAME, and wasn't elected as PROPNAME representative. I don't understand it. I work my ass off to do the best I can, but that never seems to be good enough. why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if I had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did I all of a sudden screw up math class in 0th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still. I did awesome in 0th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school. but once I hit algebra 0 and precal, shit hit the fan. I just hope I don't have to take calculus in college. but since I don't know what I want to do, I may have to. I really need to get that career test done. I've got to figure out what I want to do with myself by next semester. unless I stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste. not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that. I don't know what I want to do. what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes I guess, but that's not me. I'm coming in with so many hours that I was hoping to graduate in 0 years. that way if I go to law school I can get in and out before I'm 00, ugly, and still single. I hope I meet someone up here. I'm not built to be single or to date for years to come. ahh nose needs to stop itching. why the heck do I have to be sick? I hate this! once hell week was done I got sick. yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good. let me tell you. oh well. at least I did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit. and before my parents decided to come in. dangit! PROPNAME has a kappa kappa psi thing at 0am Sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game Saturday night, which means I wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour. oh but maybe after we paint his living room on Monday I could stay over. I don't have a class until 00:00 so that might work! jeez I'm a dork. I need to stop reading into things like this. the time will come when it decides to come. until then I got to sit back and watch things happen. oh look, I have 00 seconds left. dang 
__label__label1 I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done. I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist. My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to LOCNAME, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment. We went to the Arboretum and looked around. Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind. This whole not working thing is really different for me. For the past 0 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff. But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 00 hours and just not work. So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out. My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school. There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas. PROPNAME' b-day is Dec. 00 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents. In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of PROPNAME' skiing trip as his Christmas present. But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for PROPNAME, I would just feel weird asking. So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money. Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal. I thought about ORGNAME which is literally 0 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 0am) shift. There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning. So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon. Ok well now what do I write? I have 0 more minutes left. oh some good news. My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio. He's won a car, trips to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME (all paid for trips of course), probably 000 tickets to Six Flags and Sea World separately, and so many concert tickets you wouldn't believe it. He's just really good and always has about 0 radios going at the same time, all on different stations. Ok well I just realized that I only have 0 minute left so I guess I'll wrap things up. I do wan to say that I liked this assignment very much and that we should do all of the. bye.      
__label__label1 Today has not been a very good day for me. I found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back. My friend and I caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm. This is one of the worst feeling I have ever felt. I am dating a boy right now, but  the feelings for my ex have started to resurface. She fully knows that I like him, but she is deceiving me. I was very irritable today and I was rude to a lot of people. I really am not a rude person, I just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness. I went to PROPNAME's last night to pick up some to go food. It is sitting in my refrigerator and I am very anxious to eat it. I already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today. I love Mexican food. I have a French test tomorrow. This is our second test. I thought I made an A on the last test, but when I got it back I found a much lower grade. It upset me, so I am going to study very hard for this test. Right now I have a 0. 0 at the university, and I want to keep it as close to that as possible. I have noticed while typing this that I never capitalize 'I'. I have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times. I am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter. My roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and I wanted to go read some of her AIM logs. So, I walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and I thought I heard  her key in the door. I was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me. From that experience I have realized that I don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore. It would not be worth it if she came in and caught me. We already are going to be on semi-bad terms after I talk to her tonight about PROPNAME. One of our good friends thinks that once I talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing. He said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was "too good to be true". Oh come on. She met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much. It just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship  and goes after something that she knows will hurt me. Last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her. She told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because PROPNAME is "special". That is what got to me the most. She is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 0 days ago. I am already stressed out enough with school, I do not need roommate problems. This is the reason I do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other. My guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this. When they try to get to me, they use force. Like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows. It got frustrating, but I did not get emotionally hurt by it. Girls get you in the worst possible way. Tonight Mean Girls is showing at the Union. I want to go see it so bad because I love that movie. It is so good. I would go see it if I did not have to do all of this homework. I already had a test last week in French, I am upset that there is another one this week. Our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test. It is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework. Oh well. I have not done laundry since I arrived here in LOCNAME. I am down to my last pants and shorts. I will probably do some tonight, if I don't get too lazy. I have treated this writing assignment as like a journal. I have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that I could write it all out. It has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly. My hand are getting kind of numb. I think it is because I never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now I have to. Well, my time has come to an end. Time to get back to more homework. 
__label__label1 I hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed. I'm such a slow typer. Maybe I should take some sort of remedial typing course. I wonder if they have those at LOCNAME. It's weird how stressful this is I have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that I'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. The copying machine behind me is irritating, I wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though I've only been here for ten minutes. Has it only been ten minutes?  Damn, I have to be in here for at least another ten. I'm so hungry, I wonder what I should eat when I'm done with this. For me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food. I don't have much money and I certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen. Whenever I get hungry I have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen. I miss PROPNAME food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student ID I could eat as much as I wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed. I should make more friends who live on campus so I can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food. Wow, my twenty minutes are up. 
__label__label0 Wow, Its the end of another week ,and finally I get time to relax . My idea of relaxing isn't partying or drinking. My idea of relaxing is sleeping. Yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind, is my favorite hobby. My roommate is reading what I'm reading so I had to halt before I continued typing. There's another friend in my room and he's laughing at what I just wrote. He shouldn't be reading other people's thoughts! Wow 0 minutes over already. I got 00 minutes left . I'm just feeling really light right now. Light in the head. I can't think of anything to write. This is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment. It's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again. Tomorrow's Saturday and Saturday means another football game for UT. I couldn't go for the first game, because I didn't have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package. My roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now. So basically I'm doing two things at a time-typing and listening to music. Some people can study with music playing, I still haven't tried studying with music playing in the background. Maybe I should try it out sometime. I think it is important to knock before you enter a room. But that just doesn't happen in Jester. One of my friends just barged in, and I jumped in my seat. This is crazy. I should tell him not to do that again. I'm not that fastidious actually. But certain things annoy me. The things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being, so I know I'm not a freak. I have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week's events. It's been a great week. My chemistry test went well. I really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester, so I can get some kind of scholarship. I don't want my father to pay so much for my education. He doesn't grumble or anything, but I just feel guilty. I know that I have to work extra hard because I have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like Stand I must make good use of this advantage I have over other people. I'm loving it here. I came to LOCNAME exactly a month ago. Wow I should be celebrating today. It's been a month in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. This stupid friend is irritating me, Wish I could ask him to leave, I can't concentrate on my thoughts. He's asking me why I type with just two fingers. God. I'm going to tell him to mind his own business. I better change the topic . Or he might read this ,and get annoyed and abuse me or something. Yeah but making friends has been tough. I haven't made too many friends. My roommate is my best friend  as of now. I couldn't have asked for a better roommate. We just get along really well. Today at Chemistry class I met another Indian girl. She was from LOCNAME . She was basically an ORGNAME -American born confused Desk. Desk refers to Indians Ok my 00 minutes are up so I'm going to sign off now. I'm going shopping with my friend PROPNAME, right now. I'm going to the Target store. Then I've got to come back and do my laundry. Ok. I'm going. Bye. Writing this assignment has been great. Thank You 
__label__label0      It is interesting to note that when I work on something in my head, I always forget what the details were unless I write it down. One thing I do remember though, are the feelings. I feel like what I had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability, particularly in math. With this I acn create a continuation, or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge. This would help me learn a lot more on my own, rather than starting over as much as I do on particular problems. The only problem is I do not know how to keep a good organized notebook, rather I havjust not done it yet. I can keep things very well organized when I want t, but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do. I wish I could find a way to ake a lot of things easier. Speaking of which, I always make things easier in math. I always say that I am so good at some things because I make those things much easier than most people make them. I do this because I am lazy. Simply put, I work on something to make it easier for me in the future. Ultimately I get easier work tat way, so I am a lazy, yet slightly thoughtful person. Thoughtful in the way of thinking, not as in the consideration of others. Well my roommate walked in the room, so my stream of consciousness is screwed. So hi!! Well, anyways what was I talking about?stuff. Ohhhh my laziness. That's a long subject. I am very lazy, but I really need to work on my laziness. I am trying to do this, my mental laziness is not very bad, but physically I don't do as much as  I like. So, I guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing. I am going to try flag football this semester. and I REALLY want to play ping-pong (a. k. A. table tennis, as I  should probably start calling it). I was a little. Ok very. upset when I lost so many times the other day, I don't normally play as bad as I did that night. I just used a contraction, I was told not to use those in formal apers so I try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment, or even when talking o frieds, apparently I did not follow through with that a few moments ago. Well, other than that I am kind of at a loss on what to write. I am very hungry now, probably has something to do with the food I am smelling. I wishi could gain some weight. Which reminds me, I used to go around saying how much I wanted to be fat, but I quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that. My hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep. My eyes are shutting too. Not good when I have 0 minutes and 00 seconds left. Oh well . I want to go eat now. I have a lot of homework tonight. I won't get to do anything fun, I won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, I may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? No its not. ( I used that contraction again). . And I forgot the apostrophe, haha. Anyways college is supposed to be hard. So, I should probably enjoy working on homework 0 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while I do laundry, and then on the weekend nights I get time to play ping pong and be with other PROPNAME's Scholars people and play intramural football with them. Speaking of which I played ultimate frisbee the other day. Err I mean yesterday. It was great, It was good to have some more physical activity in my life. I scare myself cause my abs. Well, where I should have abs at least. Still hurt from limbo three days ago. Also my legs hurt to. My roommate just said scrotum. I have no idea why. Scares me a little more . Just thought I would let you know that. He is nuts, I guess I should go back to what I was tlaking about earlier. Food. Haha, I wonder how many words I can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause I am getting very tired right now, that and I am not punctuating very well, and I am using contractions without the apostrophe's. My roommate just reminded me of PROPNAME PROPNAME. Funny man!!! You should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious. I am talking as if there is someone going to read this. Oh, only a minute and a half left. My eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen. Man, I am Hungry. !!!!! heh, I just looked at the time and it said 00 00, reminded me of 0:00, I see that all the time, or at least I used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then I got hurt and it no longer showed up. 
__label__label1      hello professor, I'm doing your little writing assignment even though I have no clue what to write so Ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head. today I have to do a lot of study work, not much else to do b. C I lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 0 hours and now I'm in the UT cycling team and its pretty damn cool. I should excel in this sport because I know how to push my body harder than anyone I know, no matter what the test I always push my body harder than everyone else. I want to be the best no matter what the sport or event. I should also be good at this because I love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport? wow lots of fun. music. hmmm I like it a lot, I have lots of it in fact I have about 00 GB of music on this computer which is about 0,000 songs so I have a wide variety of music and that's good to have, its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what I do, I know lots of stuff that nobody else would know. I am extremely good at jeopardy and I usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is, they have had college and lots of schooling, most of the contestants were graduate students and I have just begun college. by the way my classes are in no way difficult, I hope your class doesn't get hard because I have a a lot of calculus which isn't hard, just very time consuming. what to write, haha now that I ask an opportunity has presented itself, a girl that I know just said hi, got me some of that last weekend, I've known her all my life and she looks pretty good too, she goes to tarleton(redneck city) but its ok, its still good. I have a way with people, if I can talk to them for about 00 minutes I can get them to really like me and if I want to I can make them do almost anything(no alchohol has to be used). you can ask my best bud who goes to school here, he knows that I have a way with people and I do that's what's so cool about this. I have a great life ahead of me and I want to live it to the fullest and no matter what I say on here I can't stop typing so I will continue and the music is great by the way damn I've got to go home this weekend, everyone misses me too much although I don't miss any of them except this girl that I went out with for bout 0 years, lots of fun there, I love her yes I do and she loves me but since I left we broke up and now she's trapped with a druggie b. C if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she's very scared but I don't care, it will all work itself out in time I just hope it won't take forever. my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject, he has no body mass, he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now, as in extremley good, I wish I could click it right now but I can't b. C my 00 isn't finished yet so I will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted, geez 00 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although I have writted letters that have taken me 0 hours to write and consisted of about 00 pages of paper, but I don't care, I don't care about much anyways, just my grades got to keep them up, I care about my family my future and the girl back home, I care about my frineds, I care about my physical health and looks that's why I love to be in shape but other than that, I don't care about much of anything, there is no reason to care and by the way I SUPPORT PROPNAME he is a good man and if the media didn't give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people don't is because of the media, I even ask them why they don't like him and all they can say is just because, I reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously BUSH!!! anyways I don't really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all, music is a beautiful artform wchich I believe is the best ever but who cares? nobody. I am out to change the world and I will you will see  --Mad Hatter--out 
__label__label1 So. I am overwhelmed. I wouldn't say that I'm completely overwhelmed and feel like crying, but I feel a little stressed out. I am not used to all this studying and it's proving to be a little harder than I thought. So much reading. It seems like it will never end. I feel like I will never be caught up. I have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math. I was worried about math but so far, it's my easiest class. Well, I guess it's good that it's not hard too. My classes aren't really difficult but there is just so much reading. I'm scared about the first test that I will take. I'm afraid that I'm going to make a really bad grade and maybe even fail it. I would be devestated. So, I'm trying to study a lot. It feels like I am studying a lot but I guess I won't know if it's all sufficient until that first test. Man, this is going pretty slow. It's only been three and a half minutes. Only 00 more to go. Well, this is the easiest writings that I've had to do so far. Just write exactly what is going through my head. Can't be that hard. Me and my roommate had our first disagreement last night. I promised her that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette at this party and then she caught me taking a drag. I felt really bad about lying to her. Yeah, I was drunk but it was still wrong. So, this morning I told her that I was really sorry and blah blah blah. She said that it was cool and everything but I don't want it to change our friendship. I still want her to be able to trust me. I know that it's just a stupid little fight but it really scares me that she might never trust me like she used to. I guess that it will all work out for the best. I love LOCNAME so much. It's an awesome place to be. There are so many good places to eat and shop and just look at. My home town only has about 0000 people in it. So Austin is a good change for me. But I do miss my parents and my bed and my shower. Man, these beds in Jester suck. I wake up and I'm sore. So, I hurt my ankle pretty bad about a week ago. We're suing the 0-00 that I tripped at because they handled the situation really badly and treated me very rudly. My roommate, PROPNAME, was awesome throughout it all. I really couldn't have done it without her. I'm glad that we don't hate eachother. But I hope that I get some money from the 0-00. It would be nice to be able to pay for an apartment next year with out having to get my parents to pay for it. They have 0 kids in college at the same time so it's going to be a tough year for them, financially. PROPNAME treats guys really weird. I would say, wrong, but it's just different than I treat guys. She's so wishy washy and is like cheating on all of her boyfriends. It kind of bothers me but if that's the way she is, I can't try and change her or preach to her about how I think she should be acting. Man, if my other papers were this easy to write, I would have so much more time on my hands. I'm only taking 00 hours, so I feel like a slacker. The thing is that if I were taking any more, I think I might cry a lot more. When will the reading ever end?!?!?! Only 0 more minutes to go. Wow, this is easy. Our dorm room used to be freezing cold but I taped some paper over the vent which made it a lot better. It's pretty ghetto looking, but it works. I haven't been able to exercise for a long time. I have to wait until my ankle is better. I can't even wear tennis shoes yet! Man, I feel so lazy and fat when I don't work out. Exercising makes me feel good! Damn that 0-00! And I bought a Texercise pass too! I'm losing some money there. I have handicap parking but it runs out on Wednesday. It's been really handy! PROPNAME, that's a word that my ex-boyfriend made up when he was in 0th grade. I've tought it to a lot of people here and everybody loves to say it. It makes me so happy when I hear my new UT friends say it because it reminds me of the good things about home. And it reminds me of PROPNAME too. So, I love to hear a good ole' bont every once in a while. The girls next door are really loud sometimes and I don't think that they like me. They've been really bitchy so far and that bums me out because I like to get along with everybody. There is this guy a few doors down from me and he's really cool. We like the same music and movies and all that good stuff. He's kind of crazy though. But I like crazy sometimes. Aren't we all a little crazy? But he's not that attractive, he's kind of a big guy. But, I've seen pictures of him when he was in high school and he was really cute. It bothers me that this bothers me. I'm not the type of person who judges others, especially by the way they look. It's not even like I'm judging him. I just think that we get along really well but I would probably never date him and it bothers me to think that I'm that vain. But I'm really just rambling and none of this makes sense very much. I know how I'm feeling, but when I try to write it, it doesn't come out right. Oh well. At least I know what I feel. Or at least, I think I know.        
__label__label0      Well, yesterday was a good day, that is until I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. I guess I was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing. I was mad at him and then hung up with him, then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him. It was just one big drama over nothing. I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean. That ofcourse made me sad, because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him. He is attending college at ORGNAME ORGNAME, the big party school, and I guess I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. He's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up. Although I haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling I've felt in such a long time. It makes me sad because I'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last. I've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more I think about it, the more I worry. Maybe that's why I was being rude to him. My fears just come out in other ways. It's so strange though because I know I can see him pretty much every weekend. I'm just so confused right now. Maybe I'm just stressed. It is my first year of college and I'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors. I just want everything to be okay. I want good grades. I want to have fun. And most of all I want to work things out with my boyfriend. I felt like crying when I got off the phone with him last night, but I held back because I didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong. When I think of my boyfriend I can only think of a future with him. I've known him a lot longer than I've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me. I know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break. I'm only 00. What are the odds of he and I actually getting married, honestly? Then it makes me think why I even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? There really is no point. On the other hand, I need to be with this boy. Life just wouldn't be the same without him. What to do? Maybe I'll just propose to him. haha, yeah right. I just want things to be okay. I just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons I am. Grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense. Anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful. Got some of my feelings out, and I've never said any of this stuff to anyone. It was like a journal. I'm glad I'm taking such a cool class. 
__label__label1 I'm thinking about if I am going to get the job that I want at the ORGNAME at the university it would suck if I didn't I am proud that the OTC called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like I didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so I can't type as fast and I keep having to go back and erase but I like pressure I thrive under it but I don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words I do not like those because I am so used to using slang that I just do not type it anymore and I also hate having to capitalize my I's it makes me mad having to go back. Right now I feel a little stress because I am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday I had a meeting and I did not know it was going to last 0 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all I could read was Biology which is another class I don't understand I never like science and getting up in the mornings at 0 does not help either I feel lost in that class it is so difficult I feel like I dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not I just keep thinking about what Prof. PROPNAME said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. Like screaming I guess but the Professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home I had a divided keyboard the "flowy" ones and now I have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment I like but I feel like I shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid I's and I forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the I messed me up again. Well forget it no more caps; the I's are going to be in lower case. Sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit I need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend I get to go home though I want to go to the game I have not boguht the sports package and I didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 00 dollars is that a lot I guess so maybe oh and my friend PROPNAME's a football player so I feel like I should go for him but I'm not going. Now I get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe I'll get sick when I go home like Prof. PROPNAME said probably because I feel the migrane coming. I hate migranes I hate having to find a job hopefully I get a good one I have an interview on Tuesday I hope it goes well and that I make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. I wonder how the bus works I keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause I have seen it once after running to the engineering building because I was late I saw the bus and I think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but I will take a look around and see if that's how it works. Now I feel like I have run out of things to say I still have to do the experiment for this class I want to do the survey but since I am under 00 I have to get my moms signature and I feel like I should be happy about going home I mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like "huh" and I hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is "kidnapped' I know I worry too much but I don't want anything to happen even if it means that I have to do all the homework, I've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was I talking about I don't kno, I need to make friends me and my roommate get along but I need other friends and now I have 0 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends I saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart Asian in the elevator today I feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that I have are okay but I don't really relate to them why I don't kno I feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least I hope they don't and if they do I don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still I have roughly 0 minutes left more like 0 because it is about to be 00 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really I am surprised I wrote this much I thought I was going to run out of this to say but I like this assignment when Prof. PROPNAME said it I was like yes no grammar rules I don't particularly like grammar but I try I mean I suck at it in my papers I always score low on it 0 minutes and I have mentioned my time too many times I tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and I did nto so now I keep talking about NOT because I want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts I think it is the flourescent lighting I think that is how u spell that and I just put the letter u for the word you and I am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and I keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh I thought it was over but I am going to stop now because a I don't want to talk for too long and I have to go turn of this light and I am thinking about what I just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if I should put my name at the bottom but I won't because I have the code thing. well this was productive and I did not put well in caps. 
__label__label0 I'm still trying to figure out why I always procrastinate. I think I like to work under pressure, I have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. I wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. I hope the second because I have never been one to study, and I would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? I thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, I can already tell I'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, I already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life I want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. I'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. I'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. I read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was Satan or the grim reaper or something like that. I think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. I hope PROPNAME wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, I am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. I just believe bush will do a lot better job than PROPNAME, and the whole LOCNAME thing I just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while I don't know everything about it, I was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people I heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. I just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. I wish I could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. I wish I could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but I don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but I don't really know what happened there, I guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. I realized 00 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because I am thinking about how long it is, or I'm not doing an activity I find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 0 or0 then having class at 0 the next morning is not fun, I'm surprised I woke up for it. I missed class the other day when I slept through it and it was at 00. that's just strange, getting up at the 0 one, but oversleeping the 00. I wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor I met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which I would agree with although I haven't experienced life after school, but I think it will be hell. 
__label__label1      When I think about what I'm thinking, a void pops up. I guess because the brain never really stops, it's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment. I can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however, so that's what I'll dicuss. A topic that's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend (surprising right?)  I think about how happy I am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is. He goes to college at ORGNAME ORGNAME, which is in my hometown of LOCNAME LOCNAME. We see eachother nearly every weekend, so it's not hard to sustain the relationship. Though, I constantly wonder if he really does care about me. He tells me that he does, and I know that he does, but I'm really insecure about that issue. My insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me, but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal. That's probably why I worry so much about it. However, I am really happy in my relationship. I have no complaints except for my own lack of security. On another topic, I have my first test this Thursday. I'm a little scared, but I think that I'll be fine. I pretty much know the material, but I still need to go over and over it to get it down. I don't think I'll have a problem with it. At least I hope that I do well. I feel exahsted thinking about all the studying I have to do for my upcoming tests. I have a chemistry test next week. I don't know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is. But I guess that I'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so I do well. It's so imperitive that I do well in college because I have plans to go to medical school after I graduate. I don't know what else I would do with my life if I didn't get into medical school. I have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen. I could be a teacher if medical school doesn't work out. The pay isn't that great but the job seems pretty alright. I would enjoy some sort of FBI/CIA type of work also. I need something that's going to make me constantly think. Though I hate studying, as every student does, keeping my mind on the go is something I love. I think that's why I played soccer all my life. Soccer is a game of constant thinking. There is no stopping in soccer. There are no time outs, so you can't stop to regroup. You have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player. I wish I was still playing soccer. I really miss it. I stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back. I feel sort of empty without it. It was such a big part of my life for so long. I think I'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the UT soccer team. It's really hard to do that though. The team is extremely competative. Though, I think after I talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help. My main concern at the moment is doing well in school. I really need to buckle down and study. I study everyday, but I need to do it more I think. Maybe I'm just stressing about my upcoming tests. I'm scared about my chemistry test. Though, I think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that I'll be fine. I need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow. The test is Thursday, so I have 0 days to get in all the information. I feel tired right now. I wish I had came back to Austin earlier so I would've started on my work earlier. Well, tomorrow's another day, so I guess I'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow. There's no sense in doing it right this second when I'm not feeling to good and when I'm tired. My main priority is studying for my biology test Thursday. I need to go over the old exam she gave to us. My boyfriend just called me, but I had to tell him that I would call him back so I could finish this writing assignment. I really hope I do well on my test Thursday. If I did well, I would be so happy. That would mean that I actually liked my major and that I could retain the information pertaining to it. I want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate "can't consontrait" with my talking, so I guess I'll go outside. Though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while I was reading. Oh well, maybe I'm a little more respectful. 
__label__label0 Ok well I'm thinking about how long of a day it was, I got to school kind of late and I was almost late to my first class. I'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny I think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 00. I just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and I told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it. Well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 0:00 if she hasnt called me. she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester. she was very moved by the way the professor was. I think she said I wish I had him for my psy class. I told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr. daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and I have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm. class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends. By the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and I love her a lot, I don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, I think we are different than most couples, I know that everybody probably says that but I really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and I hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve God in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples I think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks. But since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, I think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night. now back to her other friend named nancy. Well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what I hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt. without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad. Me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be. like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here. well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share. Hmm. What a coincidence, I mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and I think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, I mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot. my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and I told him that I don't know because I running tight on money and I kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because I went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel. the part that she got mad at was the jeans that I bought for 000 dollars and that's because they were on sale. she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that. so I don't know if ill go but I do want to play him in ORGNAME 0000 college football that's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that I haven't even tried it I think I'm going right now to go play laterz!          
__label__label0      So. Stream of consciousness, right. Well, I'm in the computer lab right now because I  didn't want to do this on my home computer which is pretty messed up at the moment. I don't  feel like writing about it. It's quiet in here, and the computers are quite nice. All I hear are the  tapping of keyboards. Tap tap tap. and what else?  I don't nkow. I wish I was doing this in my  room so I could be listening to music. The flaming lips which I'm especially into right. I  recently bought zaireeka, a fusion of the words zaire and eureeka by them but haven't been  able to play it yet. It's a kind of confusing record I guess is the word to talk about. But I've still  got like 00 minutes so why not?  It's a 0 cds played in unision concept record by the flaming  lips. wayne PROPNAME says it's supposed to be about chaos and inspiration or something. it makes  sense, trust me. but when I got people over to play it with me (you need 0 cd players and 0  people who want to help play and listen to it with you to play it) it was all chaos and no  inspiration. no one really had more than passing curiosity, and when it wasn't going all that  smoothly people gave up quickly. but yeah, I still want to play it, just need some people with  passion? to hear it with me. what else?  blah blah blah. I can't think of anything to write about. 000 000 I'm almost halfway done. some people are talking in another language across from me  now. I don't nkow what language. oh, now they're leaving. I think they're indian?  so what  language does that mean they speak??  I just wrote a sentence and deleted it. I think maybe  you're not supposed to do that?  don't think it really matters. man, I think this assignment is  kind of too long. ten minutes would've been enough. all these people are leaving around me. they're going outside into the sunshine. and I'm staring at this screen. I just spent a while  trying to figure out how to do that prescreening stuff too. I registered but then I couldn't find a  link anywhere on the site that led to the actual survey. what's up with that?  I emailed wendy or  whoever. got to remember to do that later now. prescreening survey. do it before sep 0 I think. that's like 0. 0 hours credit. we've hit the fifteen minute mark, friends. that makes this the  homestretch. that's sports lingo. not that I know anything about sports. man, that football  game yesterday was annoying. it brings out all the rowdy yelling people in the streets. and it's  so CROWDED, you know?  I hate it when it gets so crowded on campus, I dread going through  it. so many people!  why did I go to a school with fifty thousand students?  I'm spelling out the  numbers now, did you notice?  because why rush?  no reason, that's why. type tyep type. stream. of. conscious. yep, that's what I'm doing. almost done. nineteen minutes complete,  one minute to go. come on, so close. I'm so close to being outside away from the flourescent   li 
__label__label0 go back back back to the disaster . I can't get that song out of my head. It was so weird on PROPNAME's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care. I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast. what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes PROPNAME everybody likes PROPNAME she has that LOCNAME accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when PROPNAME said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think. I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 0 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back PROPNAME's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is PROPNAME I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with PROPNAME. I can't believe he slept with jo I mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing PROPNAME I mean if I was PROPNAME I would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since I don't cuss I just thought about it constantly but I think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words I sound so stupid when I cuss  
__label__label1 I am so ready to go home and see my family and friends. I have never really ever been by myself for this long. It would not be so bad if I had at least one familiar face around but I really don't. I am trying to get to know my roommates better but I guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years. In my small town we will be friends forever but here I am not so sure. I really hope I can get involved with the church here. I think that will help a whole lot. I want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole "lets get drunk at every social event" really bugs me. Why can't people just have good clean fun? I love the team and the school but I can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! Anyway I am looking forward to seeing the familiar. I love it here and am gload I came but I am looking forward to next weekend. I am really ready to see aron and my other friends. This has been the longest we have been separated. I pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever. I love him so much. We can talk about anything. It is great. We share so many things in common. He loves God and that means the most to me. It is a real balanced relationship. Wow I cannot believe it has only been 0 minutes. It feels like an eternity. I have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes. I am kind of nervous aout my classes. My major is Spanish and I am not so good at it yet. Hopefully it will come with more practice. Wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great. I cannot wait. I am so ready to be around people and meet people. I want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances. It is kind of lonely with just saying "hi how are you?" and then nothing past that. O well. I hope I am doing well in school. I don't just want to be here, I want to thrive here. I want to be the best that I can be with everything I do. I want to be proud of myself and I want others to be proud. I like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests. But then again, if I mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up. I am shooting for A's but one or two B's would not be awful. But I am studying for A's. I need to start working out. I have been sick though but I need to start again. Maybe someone might like to go with me. It is always better with someone else. I am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. I also wish PROPNAME was here, it would be so much easier. Hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. He is like a brother to me and will always be. I really miss him. Hopefully he will call back but I guess I will just call him again. Well these are all the things  I have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. I think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 00 minutes. I wish all writing assignments were this easy. I need to sign up for more experiments so I don't get behind. I also need to do some passoffs. Hopefully if I study them well today I can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 00 left. That would be good. I wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. I love my little town. I would not trade it for the world. Those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as I do but they will some day. I am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. I like it that I live here cause my dad visits a lot. My family is awesome. They do so much for me and I thank God I have them. You know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. What is this world coming to?  I am so voting for PROPNAME! 
__label__label0      Great!  Just GREAT!  I already typed for ten minutes and this thing loses everything I wrote!  GERRRRRRRR! Oh well. This isn't so bad. So. Let's seee. oh that's right. My eating disorder. Okay. I completely understand this freshmen 00 deal. because I, regretfully, am a victim. Yes, I, PROPNAME PROPNAME, cannot stop eating. So scary. I'm assuming that this is evidence of my subconscious depression that all freshmen are supposedly subjected to. Huh. Makes sense. I suppose. Hmmmm. wwwweeelll. I'm am also allergic to LOCNAME. I can't stop sneezing!  I think that perhaps my nose hasn't yet adapted itself to all this clean air as oppose to the humid smog of the one and only LOCNAME. Where are all these symptoms coming from?! So college isn't so bad. Definitely a lot more freedom. The first week wasn't so bad. Must've been all the excitment. But by the end of the second week. I was craving junk food and missing home. I'm better now by the way. After we went home for Labor Day Weekend and I am all stocked up on junk food. smiles. Dang it!  Stupid fly!  Shoo fly!  Don't bother me! Okay. So school is definitely killing me. Too much to read and my lack of study habits definitely needs polishing. But seriously though. I'm a true nerd. I even have the thick-rimmed glasses. :) Wow. Twelve minutes. Almost thirteen. How many pages is this double spaced on Word?  A page maybe?  Wow. It sure does take me a long time to write stuff. No wonder it took me forever to finish those english papaer!  FULL of nonsense. Hmmm. So glad I don't have english this year. Hey!  My twenty minutes went by pretty fast!  Wahoo!  Notice how I've painstakingly wrote all this gramatically correct?  Well, at least I got the caps and punctuations down. Go me. I can't wait until Christmas. My favorite season!  Big surprise!  Summer's fun but winter wins hands down!   So I wanted to work so I could make my own money instead of bumming off my parents all the time. But all this reading is too much!  I'm STILL behind. Its funny how I'm actually trying to study now when I wasn't much of a studier in high school. Huh. My thoughts are random. oh well times up! 
__label__label1      I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't. I wonder where the printers are. its already 0:00. its so quiet in here. I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. I hope I'm spelling okay. I can't wait until tomorrow. "and I love you, and its more then I ever knew. " (I'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. I'm so glad I learned to type. I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer. I hope I understand it. this weekend I go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and I love him more everyday. I hope this feeling lasts. I would love to marry him, in like 0 years. he's great and we're great together, I miss him. I just saw him yesterday but I miss him. I'm hungry. I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. I wonder what I'm going to eat today. I had a sandwhich yesterday. I should eat something hot. hmm. I guess I could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 0:00. I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. I wonder when the swelling will go down. I should email my dad. I hope my string doesn't come off. I forgot to put my rings back on. I hope I don't lose them. tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. I should eat. what did I eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. I should eat dinner after this. I have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. I hope I'm doing this right. hmm. I think so. I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. 
__label__label1 I do not feel well at all, I wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about a girl. Sometimes I don't know why I am still with her. Can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying? Why am I doing this Writing Assignment now my stomach and head are killing me. I should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what "they" think, I'm more interested in what other people think about. I mean I alrdy know what I think about, its boring to me, what about the people I don't know, what do they think about, that's what I want to know. I know that girl down there is thinking about something, some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls, that's what they should be working on, why learn about depression, figure out what girls think about. Honestly, I don't think a single man can tell me what a girl is thinking at any given time, half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast. What's the deal with that!  I am still feeling bad my stomach won't stop hurting, I think I need to get something to eat. I need to get feeling better cause I already have plans for tonight, and it sucks going out when you don't feel well. When I go out and I don't feel well, I get extremely annoyed with everyone that I am with. It's probably because they are having more fun then I am. I have noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics, in every class I go to we talk about PROPNAME and PROPNAME. YES, 0 more minutes to go on the assignment, but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand. In my Spanish class we had a 00 minute discussion about economic poilices, how does that help me with Hola Como estas? This assignment isn't bad, its like the people that have journals, who put there mind on paper.      
__label__label0 Well its after classes on this Friday. I am sll freaking' stressed out. Stupid Fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. It's not that I don't know how to do it, it's just that I doubted myself. I don't know, ever since I have been here I think that I have gotten dumber, when in reality I am not. I am actually pretty damn smart. I am just letting what everyone says get to my head. So it pretty much is my fault anyway. Well from now on, I am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like I am smarter than the professor that made them. I probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. Damn I miss my girlfriend. She is like so freaking hot. Yeah I know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and I wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. She is more mature than most of the girls I have for classes and some of my close girl friends. Damn I am sneezing well I am doing this in a friends room so yeah. Well PROPNAME is hot and I miss her. Its not really a distraction. Today I was tired I have no idea why I have been sleeping more than I ever have. I don't even read for classes. College isn't even hard. I could not read and make a C in all my classes but I want A's damnit. Stupid medical school. Wish I could fast forward my life about 0 years. But I'll be a pinche viejo by then. I wonder if because I am cussing the person that reads this will think I am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality I probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. And its not like I am a big cusser. Its just I have been so damn stressed lately. I was doing my chemistry homework and I ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. Not like one or two try like 00 to 00 strands of hair. Um. went blank. Nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than I can type them out. This keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. Well, here I am in college. Everyone once in a while it sets in. They are a lot of hot girls here. I really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because I am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. I have been in love before. Went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. Four damn years. My feet stink and its driving me nuts. Its like I can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. I wonder if other people have that problem. I am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. Its probably all the bacteria on my feet. O well. Tonight I think I am going to get drunk. I have never drank before, well I have taken some sips like four. Beer tastes like shit. I am just going to drink "chick" drinks. I don't care what guys say. And if I do something stupid tonight o well, I need to wind down. I have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. O well. Sucks to be in college. You know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. In fact I would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. I know I could do that but I don't know I guess I don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. I don't think I like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. I don't like to leave things to chance. But then life has screwed me over so many times before even when I was doing all the right things so what was the point. I mean I didn't drink or do drugs I mean I tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. I love God I would go to church and like it, I would have my quiet time, I would be a pretty good Christian example till like my jr. year and what happened?  My parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did. Gosh damn I am still embarrassed of what he did. So yeah all things this I was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes I would have had it. He mad 00,000 a year and my mom made 00,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley. Its next to LOCNAME, and no we weren't drug dealers. Hah. that's funny if I hadn't put that in, you might have thought that. Nah he  
__label__label0 I'm thinking I don't know what to write This popsicle tastes good, I'm really bored, my roommate is gone I'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything I'm thinking I miss my girlfriend and I should probably    call her when I am done with this the popsicle tastes good. I hear the  bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and I think it's  kind of annoying. Tonight is going to be fun, I am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good. I think I need to clean my room, it's really messy. I need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, I hear loud voices in the hall, I wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, I need to put my papers and  homework away. I am going to get another popsicle. It tastes good too. I wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly. I am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest. I'm really bored. I think I will turn the radio on. Never mind, I think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness. I hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody. I can't wait for that to start, but I am upset that I have to play coed instead of men's. This other popsicle is really good too. I feel papers in my pocket and I take them out, its my bank statements. That makes me upset because I see all the things I wasted my money on. I throw them on the floor. I'm thinking  that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because I am looking forward to stop typing this. When I am done I think I will take a shower, and then maybe, I'm thinking about something interesting I can do after that, I'm playing racquetball at 0 so something in between that. I don't know, maybe I can figure something out when my roommate comes back. I'm hungry. Now I'm eating chips. I'm laughing because I'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think I have an obsession with food, which I kind of do but that's just because I am hungry all the time. I really like the chips. I'm kind of sleepy too,  maybe I'll take a nap. I was thinking about typing and how I am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because I haven't seen him in over a year. Maybe I will call him this weekend   I love chips and salsa, it's damn good. My roommate is going to be pissed because I am eating them all without him. It doesn't matter though because I am really hungry. 0 minutes left I can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but I want to do other stuff. I'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class. I really like these chips. Well times up and now I'm really happy because I'm done.      
__label__label0 I'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing. I don't know why I was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because I'm subconsciously afraid of what I'd write. But my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 00 minutes and I'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm already typing more coherently than I thought I was going to (caffeine, maybe? Doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 0:00 already. If I get to the cafeteria too early I'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because I ignored the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME schedule. I guess I'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from LOCNAME. Roommate's explaining The ORGNAME to suitemate right now. His music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety. I've heard PROPNAME PROPNAME and uhhhhh Young Buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me. I was expecting my writing to be more PROPNAME-like; that's a great book: I even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that I did at home, either) There's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like PROPNAME PROPNAME, down to the facial hair and everything. God he's annoying, sucking up to PROPNAME PROPNAME and asking questions that --- A nerf basketball just hit me. Damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious. Not that I have anything against him for looking like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I picked my glasses because they looked PROPNAMEan (My dad has the same glasses as PROPNAME PROPNAME). The tiny old Vietnamese woman (0:00) at my optometrists (all the employees have been Vietnamese. Ong, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, &c. ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'. It sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy. (0:00)  Suitemate probably thinks I'm vaguely antisocial because I'm typing furiously instead of playing Nerf basketball with him and my roommate. The ball just went under my bed; there, he got it. Missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again. I was tempted to bring ummmmm not Ulysses. PROPNAME's Wake (no apostrophe, I remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that I already have too lofty of literature here (I was afraid of seeming to effete if I was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from College Station, but it's fine) but I already have enough unread books on my shelf. Not that I don't intend to read it all sometime. Last time I checked I was on page 000 which I think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all. Somewhere I read that Joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision. which would make PROPNAME happy. It's funny what you learn from ORGNAME ORGNAME. Apparently the record at shots at the Nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 0. Or maybe 0. Maybe PROPNAME made 0 and PROPNAME 0? I wasn't really paying attention, but  Ooh, my sister just signed onto AIM. We need to try that LOCNAME restaurant on 00th sometime. I occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that I'm paying attention to their little basketball game PROPNAME made 0 now. PROPNAME's trying from distance, missed. Standing right next to me, apparently I'm 0 point range. When I grow up I bet I'll have to patronize my kids similarly. 00:00 I can eat before too terribly long, then I'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar  PROPNAME just backed into me. Ewww This 00 cent song is so violent. At first I thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy. 00:00  He's putting the Onion volume 00 back on my shelf, upside down. They're leaving for dinner, asked me if I wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment. He doesn't think he like's quesadillas. They're ok, but I prefer them without too much stuff in them. Which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that. So I'll be down in a few seconds. unless the elevators take too long which they do. What else. AIM. Got my course packets today. IT was easier to find but PROPNAME's I had to search for.  DONE! 
__label__label1 I don't know why, but for some reason I am extremely nervous about this writing  assignment. It most likely won't even be read! Random, but I started thinking  about what an awful driver I am in LOCNAME. All of the one way streets and stop  signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. I've already ran two red  lights. whoops. Since this writing assignment is online, I can't help but read the  instant messages that pop up while I'm typing. I love talking to people online, I  think I'm addicted. It really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family  now that we are all living in different cities. Especially since two of my best friends  are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, I can talk  to them all at the same time. It is very convenient. Since coming to college I have  become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. Tomorrow night the Sig  Eps are having an 00's theme party, so last night I spent about an hour  downloading hit songs from the 00's. My friends and I are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. It will be awesome. Today my friend PROPNAME and I  went shopping at thrift stores to find 00's garb. I found the best 00's pumps for only  six dollars. Can you say jackpot?  I think my favorite 00's song right now has to be  PROPNAME's Girl by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wish I was Jessie's girl, because then I would  date his best friend. Speaking of dating, I think dating in college is going to be  rather difficult considering there are approximately 00 gorgeous girls on campus  to every one attractive guy. Not that looks are everything, but that is what  generally draws two people together to start talking. Actually I think that is usually  the case, but I am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the  attractive hard asses. Racquetball is my new favorite sport. I have played five times since I've been  here. It's really the best work out. It's so much better than running for 00 minutes. just play racquetball for 00 minutes and you can't breath. It's such a great feeling. I have had a few complaints though, because I tend to accidentally hit the person I  am playing with a little too often than necessary. I've hit my sister like twice and I  couldn't even guess how many times I've hit PROPNAME. Whoops! I love going to concerts. They are probably on my top 0 favorite things to do list,  along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. I wish we had some  snow nearby, but I would hate to live in the cold so I guess I don't really want snow  close by. I almost went to school in LOCNAME, LOCNAME but I realized I would have  to wear about 0 layers of clothing just to walk to class and I decided it just wasn't  worth it. I am a Texan, if I didn't break a sweat between classes I don't know what I  would do with myself. I can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new  college friends. I have been looking forward to that for a 
__label__label0 I am currently thinking about how ready I am to go home this weekend. I didn't go home for labor day weekend because my girlfriend came here to visit me. I can't wait to see her and see if she is feeling better. She has been sick for the last four days. I also can't wait to drive my new car. I just got it this summer but I haven't been able to drive it because I don't want to bring it to LOCNAME. I wonder what we are going to do in Psychology today? I wonder if he is going to do another demonstration like he did last class? I just drew a blank and can't think of what to say next. I really want to go watch a movie this weekend because I haven't went to the movies in a really long time. I wonder what I will buy PROPNAME for her birthday in December? Probably some flowers and some chocolate and maybe buy her a gift certificate to get a massage. I wonder what she will buy me for Christmas? She said it was something I have been wanting but I didn't know I have been wanting anything. I hope the camera I bought on Saturday is going to be here this week. I bought the new ORGNAME DSC-T0 which is the credit card size digital camera sony makes. I can't wait to get it I have been wanting the camera now for six months. I miss my 0000 Camaro. I restored it this year and during the summer I went to LOCNAME and traded it in for a 0000 SS Camaro. Wow what a change that car hauls butt and is nice because it has air conditioning which the 00 didn't. I still have my 00 Camaro and I will probably be wanting to restore that one pretty soon. My dream is to be a Orthodontist and I can't stop thinking about if and when I will realize if this dream could be a reality. I know I have to wait 0 more years to apply to dental school but I can't tell if I will have high enough grades to get accepted. I really hope my ORGNAME class isn't as hard as I am making it out to be. I took Chemistry ORGNAME last year in high school so I would be prepared but I feel a little discouraged. I wonder what experiments I will sign up for in Psychology. I have been looking but I haven't found one with my interest? I wonder if my dad is really going to help me get a racecar because I have always wanted to race and two weeks ago we went to the track to see if we were interested and my dad said we probably will race next year. My father raced when he was my age and I have always wanted to follow in his footsteps. He was very good and I have seen proof from the programs that he was in. I am starting to smell the food I just recently cooked. It smells like pizza. Maybe because that's what I fixed. DUH. My eyes are starting to hurt from looking at the screen without looking away. I am getting really annoyed by the people living on the top floor. They keep making noise. It sounds like an elephant is walking on top of me. It is disrupting my train of thought. I am really hoping that tonight I can take a break and not have to do any homework.
