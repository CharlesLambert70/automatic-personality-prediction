__label__label1 This blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. I wonder why I put 0 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-I probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. I wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, I’m going to scoot up. I can't believe its Sat at 000 PM and I'm writing this. I'm such a nerd. actually I'm not. ,. I'm cool--but that's all relative I guess. I’m really into drinking my coffee and I’m staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and I really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it?  Jewel is playing in the background volume 0 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. I can totally relate. I wonder if PROPNAME is thinking about me right now--I hope he's not the T. A for this class. This is so incredibly weird. I think I like him but I’m not sure. he reminds me of PROPNAME wolf and I can't stand him is that a bad sign?   I like PROPNAME's accent too. wow English accents are really cute. Like in LOCNAME. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like PROPNAME PROPNAME but he was speaking Italian so I doubt it was him. I wonder How PROPNAME is doing?  And PROPNAME?  Why isn't PROPNAME calling me?  I hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. Kind of like max. I wonder how he's doing I wonder about his dumb model sister in LOCNAME. whatever. I love Jewel. I want to play piano right now even though I haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 0 :00 already and this is pretty fun. I should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks I'm a rambling idiot?  I have an ache in my heart about the council. I wonder why my name isn't on the list?  I swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. They are so retarded. Maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think I'm full of crap and Making it up. but I really think that way. Maybe it's cause I was listening to Jewel at the time,. I wonder when my roommates are getting home  they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 000am this morning for crew tryouts. Ok, I probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. I have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. I wonder if St0eve will get back to me on being the coxin. I have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did I staple PROPNAME’s number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me?  He writes like such a guy. My walls are so bare. and the st0reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. I wish I could write songs like Jewel. I want to play the guitar well too. I miss my Dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and I wonder why I returned that dress. this screen is so confusing I lose my place my toe hurts and I feel full. My wrap was gross though. I can't believe they didn't take my CDs--they’re so retarded. My tailbone hurts and I hope I'm not sore tomorrow PROPNAME was a bit extreme. I keep hitting the wrong keys I really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but I know I need to do my homework. I hate calculus homework. I’m dreading it. I wonder why I’m so down and pessimistic today?  I'm usually not. Oh--gosh, I've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. I wonder if I typed more than other people did and I wonder if a TA. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it?  weird. Maybe I should play my guitar. 
__label__label1 I suppose we all get caught up in a web our first year. I wonder sometimes if it is going to be too much for me to handle. I guess everyone feels the way I do. People sure make me feel that they are smarter than me though. I should do well. Why not, I have just as much potential as the next person. This person sitting  next to me now is making me tense. I wonder why. Come on PROPNAME, your a Drama  major, your not suppose to feel nervous. I feel better now that she left though. Man some of these people really type fast. I don't even hear any pauses. Great, another victim sitting next to me. I suppose we are all victims though. I wonder what everyone else wrote on this paper. It feels a little odd. Seems kind of like my mind just rambles on. I guess everyone's does though. I really need to speed up my typing. I used to be so quick. I really have a lot of stuff to do today. Man I miss my best friends. I miss PROPNAME even though I hate to admit it. It seems like I tell her that more than I tell anyone else. Maybe she is the same way. I know she probably is making up some reason why I don't love her anymore. She is just whiny like that. I wish she wasn't so negative. I'm always going to love her. Too bad she is in LOCNAME. Ok, somebody turn on the air in here. It is  getting a little warm. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME are up to. I know PROPNAME is mad at me but I only wish she knew the way LOCNAME really is. I mean, it is not like I'm the only one telling her to watch out. Ten minutes to go, or is it five? Oh well, I'll just keep pecking at the keys. I really don't want to go to class today. I don't know how people can skip though. That is all I need is to get  behind on all my work. I still have another one of these things to write tomorrow. My classes are cool though. I shouldn't panic too much. Come on, I'm only taking 00 hours. But then, I am just a fish. I'm sure most people feel the same way. I know PROPNAME does. I wonder if he ever goes out and does anything. I'm really surprised that he came to PROPNAME's party with us. Ahhh, he had a good time. This  city is definitely not LOCNAME. I hate to admit it, but, I think I like it better  there. I wonder who I will end up together with. I'm lonely but yet I don't think that I want anything serious. Oh what do I know?  00:00, I think I have 0 more  minutes. Whoever is reading this probably thinks I'm nuts. I wonder if someone really is going to read all of this since there is so many students. Wow, the typing is getting better. It is funny what a little practice will do. I wonder if they have a word processor down here. Why does everything have to be online. It might not be so bad if I could get mine to work. I wonder what I am going to do. Oh  well. Yea, finally through. 
__label__label0 000-00-0000 Sean crow male 0       I sure hope this thing works. I hate computers. I have been trying to  figure out how to use these things forever now and I am going to pray that it w works out well . Does stream of consciousness require correct punctuation I sure hope not. I am tired today because I stayed up tell four in the morning  and woke up at nine o'clock. the guy sitting next to me is weird because he  types so very loud. I sure hope this assignment works out all right. Psychology is very interesting to me. I used to want to be a psychologist  until I realized doctors probably get paid more. I am a not happy today. I  feel that the world is against me right now. That is stupid because I will  probably feel better when I finish my homework. I hate school. What is a  zip? my feet are soar. I got in a car wreck yesterday and I have a bump in my head that hurts me very much. My friend was afraid because he lost his wallet  that had a drivers license in it. It is cold in this room yet it is hot  outside. my Eyes are tired from the sun. My sister went to PROPNAME springs  today but I could not go due to the fact that  I am tired. I am the worst  typer. I due one finger at a time. I like to sleep. Tequila is disgusting  tasting. why do I feel so depressed at this moment. Probably because I had  too much fun last weekend. It is impossible to have fun during every  weekend. The rest of my weekends will probably be very bad and disappointing . I have not been in a theater in a while. I wonder what my old girlfriend  is doing now. Is she thinking of me. Probably not. I think that this is  not going to reach its destination. I am feeling extremely nervous right now. I think my twenty minutes is up. SOmethin is very unusual about the way this looks.       
__label__label0 I am in the computer, I wish I’m I bed right now, God I'm tired. Are my doing this right I sure hope so. Do I need to hit return after each line. Man this is harder than I thought. only 0 mins past. I wanna go  eat lunch now. Boy I type fast. That girl is really good looking, I wonder what her name is. That music is  really loud will you please turn it down!  The computer lab is closing in 00 mins, I think I can finish before then. Man this is weird, writing down want you are thinking. I need to go back to LOCNAME and bring my basketball here. I missed my room. Need help?  The lab assistant is there to answer any of your questions, yeah right, that  girl here yesterday was no help at all. I wish I have a computer in my dorm. I wonder if my roommate is still asleep. I should be sleeping to. I think I did this in high school, but I’m not sure if it's the same thing. I really need this ten points, so I better get a good grade on this. I missed PROPNAME, I wish she's here with me  right now. I wanna an ice cream. Boy this is Boring, I really do think about a lot of things. Turn the music  down damn it. Hey I like this computer. Do I need to print this out?  Boy two more papers to go. I wonder if PROPNAME will go out with me ever, nah, she's not my type any ways. Do I need to do this in Paragraphs, I sure hope not God How long do I have to do this. I'm thinking about what do think now. yes today is the 0th. nice hat. I need  some money.

Yes, one down two to go. 
__label__label0 I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at ORGNAME ORGNAME and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 00. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 00 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my "big sister's" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else. 
__label__label1 I've done alot of self-analysis lately. I realize a few things about myself. I'm a bit obsessive and I believe that may hinder the growth of my current relationship The person I started dating is a wonderful guy, but I take all the small things to heart His dealing with a alot of coming out issues and that makes it much harder on him. The  nature of the relationship itself is freaky even for me here is this guy. I've been  best friends with him for three years now. He and I have been roommates for about two years and it's like all of a sudden the doors of our relationship have flown open. He is now doing things that before I didn't imagine with him. He was a friend now he's something. Do I want this? Yes, I guess. I have talk to numerous people about  this, like PROPNAME. She is a wonderful friend. Her whole entire existence revolves around  one thing right now. Sex! It seems to be a common search for people our age. What if you settle for less, because emotionally that person is so well suited to you. Is that bad or good. I view that as okay. I need reach within myself and learn whether or not. Settling  for less is good or bad. I do know one thing. I do great work, when motivated. I become more goal orientated lately. Setting one tasks and completing it well. It is time consuming  but I believe it will be more beneficial to those I serve. I've been struggling to pick a major  and right now I don't know. I'm so lost I really just need some direction. This school year  has just been really confusing. My whole life has changed in a matter of one month, but I'm happier. Happiness is really a weird word. I think sometimes it just adding a little bit of energy to a  doomed project. Who knows time to reconsider my thought and self image. Life would be easier,  if there wasn't some guy up there scrambling our thoughts. I don't believe in a higher being, but  maybe there is a higher bean. hehehehe!!!! I used to believe in God then during some "clarity" I thought who would do right by making animals who feed off of each other. Either emotionally,  physically or mentally, finding those symbiotic relationships I guess is one of life's little hills we must all conquer. I love life! 
__label__label1 My girlfriend just ask me to turn off the CD player and do my work. ORGNAME is on and there is a women and a guy fighting for some reason. My girlfriend is now munching with her mouth wide open. I’m attempting to make Baked Potatoes but I think that they are going to burn. I went shopping to day for food and believe or not this was the cheapest trip yet. I think its because my so called girlfriend thinks that I  am thinnely challenge. . I'm trying to figure other things to write about but nothing is coming to mind. My girlfriend is still stuffing her face with frito scoops. I don't understand how she can eat just as much as I do yet she has the body of a swim suit model. Her Metabolism must be skyrocketing. My train of thought is fading again. Lets get back on track again. It is 0:00 PM and dinner is almost serve because my lover is about to feed me like a king. I trying to type as fast as I can with out a mistake. My girlfriend just ask if she could read mine yet I really don't want her to. she probably yell at me and call me an idiot. She is now eating her food in front of me and she spilt her ranch dressing all over her new shoes. (ORGNAME ORGNAME)  her baked potato looks so good right now with bacos and cheese and  I think sour cream or it may be butter. I cant really get a good look at it!!!   I'm a soph fixing to be a junior and my girlfriend is a freshmen. Yet , I'm taking classes that she's in!!!  I feel stupid the thing is she is so smart. She was valedictorian of her class. Her major is biology and mine is Kinesiology. I'm studying to be a physical therapist and she wants to save the world by saving the rain forest and finding cures for all diseases. I just transferred in from ORGNAME this semester and while I was there I took most of my basic except math and science classes. She placed out of some of  her classes. Do you see what I'm getting at. I feel insecure sometimes about my intelligence. I know I can do anything I want I just wished I would of took advantage of it when I was younger. My life would be alot better if I had just did my work when from the start. My freshman year I took 00 hrs. and dropped 00 of them. Sounds stupid huh I think working at a club  until 0 and sometimes 0 in the morning had some affect on it. My last semester at ACC I pulled a 0. 0 and this year I plan on getting a 0. 0 just to prove to myself and others that I can compete with the best of them.  
__label__label1 Okay, now is the time -- I usually don't have trouble writing for a long period of time - at least typing, because I think I type faster than I write. I am continuously writing e-mails to people. In fact, one semester I was even addicted to the Internet!  I was always on it. I wasn't as bad as my roommate at the time thought he never even went to class!  I couldn't believe it. At least I knew to be addicted at nighttime!  Anyway - I enjoy typing and I really enjoy writing my thoughts. This stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior year in high school when we got to read PROPNAME PROPNAME in my English class. It was the best book I read all year - the Portrait of the PROPNAME as a Young Man - does this computer have a way to skip to the next line, or do I do that myself?  Well - I shall do it myself. OK - anyway - about PROPNAME PROPNAME - in PROPNAME PROPNAME. The entire book was written the way I am writing this essay. I guess it is an essay -- I always thought they were spelled like S. A. !  but - that seems stupid when you think about it. Psychology really seems interesting. But - I know the tests are hard. I am graduating in December and I have always wanted to take Psy. I just never had the time when it came to  my major and all the government, etc. classes I had to take. I can't wait to  graduate. There is so much red tape at this institution. Yesterday - just to add into a class that wasn't even full - My God. You would think the class is controlled by Zeus himself!  I had to fill out forms - and then I had to make inquiries and get permission from the professor. Just so I could take Accounting 000f for Non- Business majors that isn't even a grade for me since I am taking it pass/fail. Now does that not sound stupid. Sometimes I think education has become too much like government. Not enough quality - just a lot of  quantity of BS where nothing is really ever accomplished. The status quo just seems to prevail. I think that is terrible. but -if you think about it - it makes sense. This institution cares not if I get a good education- but rather if I am able to  jump through all the hoops it places before me. Whether I can read the fine print and take all the courses and get all the red tape cut before I graduate. Is that what the college experience should be about?  I guess college prepares  a person for life. Not in the classes taken per se - but in the lifestyle of the student. So - if I understand that life is simply college magnified, and if I can jump through all the hoops placed before me in college and actually graduate with my 000 hours, then maybe life won't be as complicated and difficult. The question then becomes if life gets more simple and less strenuous and frustrated, then shouldn't college follow in suit?  Since I don't believe that will ever happen, I guess the college is here to stay. If anything - college prepares a person for graduate school!  Law school, oy - a Yiddish expression - I can't wait for that!  I am taking a course now on constitutional law by Dr. PROPNAME. I absolutely love it. - It mystifies me, the Constitution. What does is cover - what responsibilities does it have. How does one know?  All these questions can be answered and asked in this class. There are only 00 people in the class - compared to the 000 or so in PSy. class, I would say that's pretty good!  I think I figured out how to do these lines on this computer I just have to push return before getting to the end of the line instead of  writing one line to eternity. How does the TA actually know that I spent 00  minutes on this?  What if I simply type really fast and I get more words on the screen than the next guy?  What if I say -- well, it's only been 0 minutes but - I gotta go?  Who ever thought of that movie with PROPNAME PROPNAME about the future and sex is regulated!  DAMN!  I promised myself to write about everything in the world not having anything to do with sex. I thought that for 00 minutes  I could think of not having sex. Damn. I guess I am just a typical 00 year old guy who can't get his mind out of the gutter. that really upsets me I always thought I could be more than the average PROPNAME. Well - that shall be for my next paper on the college experience. Boy - are y'all gonna love that  or what?!!  GOTTA GO NOW -- THE PROFESSOR IS CALLING ME!!!  
__label__label0 I have so much to do. I need to go get ready for track, but I would really  like to sit down and relax. perhaps go outside and sit by the pool and  catch some rays. I c0ompletly failed my music quiz. I wish I could have  prepared better. I  have been running around and it would feel so nice to just sit down and relax. What am I writing about. This seems so odd to  'sit here and write what I am thinking. I feel like  I should be trying to  keep my typing neat. and worry about spelling/grammar. Oh well. I am very sore. I wish that I didn't work out so hard because now I'm  paying for it. I really need to go read my kinesiology work. I wonder if  the person who reads this what she thinks, She must get so many strange responses. I hope this goes through the email system in time. I have  random thoughts. I guess everyone's thoughts are random. I wonder How PROPNAME is doing. I really need to call her but I don't have the m money for this month to spend on more long distance calls. It's so weird being away from dad and mom. I almost miss the nagging, but I guess  PROPNAME's taking their place. She really mad me mad last night. I wish she would be more considerate when getting dressed in the morning and ready for bed at night. The boyfriend thing is getting out of hand. Why doe's so someone want to go around and tell people that her boyfriend is psychotic? I hope PROPNAME's roommate mobes out so that I can talk about mobing in with PROPNAME at the end of the semester, but I feel bad leaving PROPNAME, but if she is going to be this much of a perfectionist and somewhat inconsiderate I have to look out for myself. I hope PROPNAME is doing well with his Steave  situation. I know that I could help him out, but I don't want to be the know it all little sister. PROPNAME is so sweet and I don’t' want PROPNAME to  push him around. I think I've been writhing for a long time yep, it's been 00 min. bye. 
__label__label1      Well, I feel good about the fact that I am getting this assignment done  well before it is due. Today is one of those days that I feel really  motivated to do my homework, as opposed to those days in which I don't   do anything worthwhile. The excitement of college is starting to wear off and I think that the reality of the fact that I am here is finally sinking in. I really hate the way this typing field doesn't automatically move the sentence down to the next line! I really don't seem to be thinking about anything  interesting right now. I am just feeling average, not extremely excited or  unhappy. I really cannot think of anything to type. I think my mind is clearing  itself like it usually does when I sit down to right a paper. No stray thoughts seem to be coming to me. I am fairly excited about this psychology course. I think this course will not only be very interesting but helpful as well  because I plan to go into medicine. Boy, this twenty minutes is going by slowly. I think I might be typing too much too fast. Perhaps I am supposed to sit and wait till a thought comes to me before I type. I have tried to type in my current thoughts and feelings. My roommate is typing on his computer as well, annoying. Now he has turned on his fan, which is fairly loud . he switched it off. Still no  stray thoughts. I guess composing these sentences are thoughts. This assignment  is all I am thinking about right now. Four minutes to go. Three minutes to go. I have to go out and buy an answering machine today. I have to get back before nine  so I can make the upper East Jester floor meeting. Free pizza will be there! I hope its Double PROPNAME's. Oh, they have good pepperoni rolls, I don't know about their pizza. Well, it has been 00 minutes.   
__label__label0 Right now there is really not much going through my head. I woke up about an hour ago from a nice, long sleep and my mind is clear. I guess I have some worries about school, like am I studying enough and really am I going to make it, but I guess that all depends on my actions. I am also real worried about the social things getting involved with my school work. There is just always something going on, and sometimes it is hard to choose to study over all of the fun things, but so far I feel that I have done a pretty good job, but then again it has only been two weeks. I am enjoying where I am living, and as of now my roommate and suite mate situation seems OK. It is weird to think that after knowing for so long that I wanted to attend UT, to actually be here going to school and not just visiting. It really hasn't hit me yet, but it probably will soon. It also feels weird to have to pick up the phone to have to talk to my parents and not have them be in the next room or just down the hall. And for it to also cost money to have to talk to the people that I am used to talking to on a daily basis. I also have some scared feelings going through me, fears that most people have. For example, you hear all the stories of these awful things that have happened on college campuses and in college dorms, which sometimes makes it hard to go anywhere alone. You are always having this fear inside you that something might  happen to you if you take one step into the wrong direction. That is really scary for me, probably because of things that have happened in the past. When I was in 0th grade my family was robbed at gun point in our house and the threatened to hurt or even kill. One of my sisters and I slept through it, but my parents, my other sister, and my house keeper all had guns held to their heads. No one was hurt, but it was still really scary. then 0 years ago the sister who was asleep with me was out to eat with a friends family and they were followed home and were also robbed at gun point, and had pillowcases put over their heads, but could still feel the gun against their head. In this situation, no one was hurt either. But I am the only one who has never had a gun to me or was threatened, and I fear that I might be the next, and that really scares me. Well, my 00 minutes is almost up, and it went by a lot quicker then I imagined that it would, and I really enjoyed figuring out what to right about. It was really interesting. 
__label__label0 Right now I am thinking about my girlfriend and what she is doing. Why is this guy behind me being so loud in the study center. I almost forgot how to spell "center. "  This guy is trying to be as loud as possible. What is going on tonight?  I sure do have a lot of homework. Why doesn't this guy get a megaphone so he can be even louder?  Shut up Please!  I hate this kid. Why is this girl laying on the couch doing her homework?  I had fun last night. I wonder what my roommate did. This guy is really pissing me off. What the hell is his problem?  I swear to everything that is holy if he does not shut up I will make the next four years of his life a living nightmare. What is my friend PROPNAME doing right now?  This is boring. Not hard though. This seems so stupid of a time. It's only been five minutes I still have fifteen more to go. What classes do I have tomorrow?  SHUTUP ASSHOLE!!!  I have Calculus and English. One hour classes not too bad. I am tired. I am going to take a nap later. I am getting tired of writing. Getting sleepy. What is this guy next to me doing?  This guy that walked in is a real dork. I wonder what he did last night. Only ten minutes to go. This jerk is moaning out loud now. What is he thinking?  I am going to kill him. This guy's headphones are way too loud. I am hungry. Why?  I just ate. I am getting tired of waiting. This is boring. Only eight more minutes that I have to listen to this inconsiderate bastard. That guy wants that girl. I am through now. I am going to my room to sleep. 
__label__label0 I am very frustrated with this computer. I am the most computer illiterate person, and for this day and age, that is no good. I want to check my e-mail but it is telling me my password is incorrect. I am famished right now. I have had this job on my mind all day. I really want to teach dancing but she wants me to teach tap along with ballet, jazz, and cheerleading. I am not the most qualified person to teach tap and I feel I would be doing my students a great injustice be teaching that class. Also she has me working on Saturdays and if I ever want to go home I will have to find a substitute teacher. This is going to take up a lot of my time and as a freshman I need to make the grades. Especially around finals I will need time to study and that is when the studio is going to have a winter show. That means I would have to choreograph six dances and find music. But the thing is I really want to teach dancing like I did back home. This is such a hard decision because I already accepted the job and I feel bad backing out on PROPNAME, the owner. I guess after writing all of this out there are more cons than pros. My friend PROPNAME is sitting next to me and he keeps asking me how to spell words. He is interrupting my train of thought. I love typing on computers I just don't know too much about them. I really want to check my e-mail. My dad me something and I would like to read it. I think I'm hungry for Chinese food tonight. But chips and hotsauce sound so good. Really I think I want Italian. I can always eat Italian food. I guess it is since I am almost 000% Italian. The food a Jester is really bad. I have been living off tuna and speghettios that I keep in my room. You know I think I'm going to quit my job that I just got two days ago. I really need to call her right now but I'm at the PROPNAME, so I will do it when I get home. My arm is kind of  hurting from typing. Maybe I have carpal tunnel syndrome. Just kidding. I was looking for the submit button but I'm not sure which one it is. I'll have to ask PROPNAME. He is my boyfriend and my best friend. I wasn't sure if I would want a boyfriend my first year of college, but right now I am glad I have him. I think a lot of it is we are more like friends most of the time. Or really a lot like brother and sister. But I love him. Well I have a lot of other homework and studying I can be doing so this is the end of my thoughts. Well those will never end but this is the end of me recording them. Bye!     
__label__label1 I wish it was Friday actually I wish it was next Friday then I would be going home vacuums really bug me I want to change the channel but I don't want to get up but duck tales really sucks and even though I’m not even watching it and just hearing it bugs me I guess that's something you just have to deal with if you're lazy I want to talk to PROPNAME but I don’t want to call him because I called last but he hasn't called me which really doesn't make much sense but guys don't make any sense anyway so its ok I don't want to go to calculus tomorrow but I should because I’ve already missed it twice I wish it would rain I want to get caught in the rain I want some Dr pepper but I don’t want to go buy some because I don't want to spend the money I want to get an exhaust even though I haven't even found anybody to race up here I should write to PROPNAME I need to check the mail who cares about the kennedys I hope I have some mail but I really doubt it I never get mail my room looks so boring I don't like living in a dorm it really sucks but I guess this is better than jester it's kind of hard to think and write at the same time I hate typing why are her clothes still hanging there what's wrong with using the dryer I need to do laundry double your pleasure double your fun my boobs itch I guess I shouldn't have tanned for so long     
__label__label1 Stream of consciousness---I am not sure what to write at all  everything in my head  comes in little spurts of information. "Turn the radio on, turn the radio up, and this woman was singing my song,  lover is crying cause the other won't stay. my stomach hurts and I have to go to the bathroom, I think I just saw PROPNAME PROPNAME Now that I have to think about something I can't. which is strange because usually I think too much about  everything right now that song by PROPNAME PROPNAME keeps running through my head even though I really hate that song. I feel really bad for Princess PROPNAME's kids. but I actually have that morbid curiosity  to see the pictures of the accident scene and it makes me feel awful. do I have to work tomorrow?  My bangs keep getting in my face---I should never have gotten them My roommate is bothering me right now. she always leaves hair on the bathroom sink and on the floor  and it really disgusts me, especially in the morning when I am already in a bad mood, and  sometimes she gets this real high moral attitude with me like she knows better and doesn't want to break the rules by painting the walls because Mr. PROPNAME might get mad, yet she has all this pot in her closet What a hypocrite!  I hope I make ORGNAME ORGNAME, although I have to admit that I thought the whole thing was really fake  Okay, now really nothing is going through my head I wonder if the people next to me are looking at what I am writing, they better not, that is such an invasion of privacy, although I would look at theirs  any day. there is this disk sitting right here and it is not mine but I want to use it because I didn't bring a disk so that I could check email but I don't even know whether or not it is formatted for a PC, that guy was really cute. I wish I was in LOCNAME right now. wow these computers really filled up fast ---there is already a line to get on them oh well too bad for them. oh damn I forgot to go get that course packet for government, oh I need to call that ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME number I think they changed the computer system here in the SMF because the setup is different, that guy reminds me of somebody but I can't think who, I wonder if I can check my email without a disk If that is PROPNAME PROPNAME he sure got fat. I wonder if I need to bring my psychology book today, but I don't think I have time to walk all the way home and then walk back, I will just share with PROPNAME I need to check on my stocks, maybe they have finally earned me some money, and I need to get my portfolio going. I want my car back  
__label__label0 I have done these things before and I really don't think that they work. I had to do one in English one time and I hated it. I guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now I will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. I love scream, its on the tv right now and I like this movie. ;  I here that the second one is do out this winter so I’m excited. I really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. The brain is so complex. I used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew I was thinking about itself. Hmmm, I don't know what to say  exactly. I am gonna play some pool after I get done writing this paper. I have a pool table at home so I am probably better than average but lately I've been playing worse and worse. It really frustrates me too. I hate when I don't play basketball for a while because then I go back and I'm just A LITTLE OUT OF RYTHEM OR I MISS A SIMPLE SHOT OR SOMETHING. Recently I have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and I feel bad about that because I always pre0ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. I'm being A BIT Distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. I don't know I f  I can really   fill up another ten minutes but I guess I can because I have to. It really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because I've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so I don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines I don't know if I agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because I know I don't think of sex that much. Imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny A hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. I often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. I wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . I coughed. ehehehehe  I think I have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. I wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get I would love to be able to read some of them . I think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. I don't know what I’ve been told . I like led zep but not all of their stuff. It is pretty good though . I wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . I hope so Oh my time is up so I'm gonna go know. Bye bye baby!!!! 
__label__label1 I have a ton of things to do. I still need that book for MIS. I wonder  what PROPNAME is doing?  He's probably waiting for me to call him back. Man,  I'm so happy matti called. I miss her very much, I wish she still lived here. I can't wait to hang out with PROPNAME's sister and husband that should be pretty cool. The purple on this screen is sort-of pretty. I can't  believe it actually feels cool in this house, it's always so hot in here. I hope you go downtown tonight I haven't been since school started. I'm always studying or I have to wake up so early. I can't believe I'm not  swearing as I write. It's kind of a natural thing for me but I'm holding  back in case who ever reads this gets offended. I think my mom's home I wonder what took her so long to get home. Usually she is always getting  home from work early. I wonder if I'm going to get a bad grade on this because I keep pressing return, but if I don't then I have to click the  arrow buttons and that takes to much time away from my typing. Man this is getting easier as I go, I thought I'd start typing and just go blank. Why  do people ask so many questions?  I guess I do and I just don't notice it. I keep thinking of different things while I'm typing. Days Of Our Lives  was so good the other day. PROPNAME slapping PROPNAME was awesome I've been  waiting for the day for Austin to find out that PROPNAME was lying. PROPNAME  doesn't even like her anymore for not telling him that will was his son. My neck is starting to hurt. I would hate to have a data entry job, that  would get so old. It's so crazy that I asked PROPNAME about PROPNAME today and they got in a fight just last weekend. I completely forgot about  PROPNAME until I saw her best friend the other day when we went tubing. Tubing was a blast I hope we do that again before it gets to cold. I was  drunk as a skunk. that food from LOCNAME LOCNAME was good or maybe it tasted  good because I was drunk and super hungry. I wonder how many students from UT are online right now?  I bet a whole bunch. I like this new desk my  parents bought for me. It's so much nicer than what our computer use to sit on. I need to start exercising. I have a membership at world gym, and I pay $00. 00 a month and I never go. But if PROPNAME didn't work at nights then I would make him go with me. I hate going by myself, because it's  so boring if you don't have some to talk to or if you don't have headphones. My headphones broke so I guess I'm just going to keep making excuses until I get my lazy but up and workout. Right? Right. Well I'm pretty sure it's  been 00 minutes so goodbye. 
__label__label0 I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to ORGNAME. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldn’t figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an "f". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 0 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because I’m here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at ORGNAME because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to ORGNAME's. We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. He needs 00 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 00, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. PROPNAME just walked in and said Hi!. now she looked at my screen I'm not crazy, I am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me.  I needed to get this done today because I have plans for the rest of the week after Wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. I should've recorded what time I started typing, huh!  that would have been beneficial. I’m retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes I have no common sense. I wonder what my grades will be like this semester. I am used to straight A’s, and I hope I can accomplish this in college as well. I need to petition my AP grades sometime soon, but I don't know when or where. oh, well, I’ll look it up somewhere, and get it done. I need to do some laundry today, too. I am running out of plain little T-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe I’ll find something cute while I’m shopping today. I hoe my boyfriend ( PROPNAME is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think I am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what I am engraving into it. so he'll remember. I am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. I need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz I am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know I live at 00th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. I think I have been typing for twenty minutes so I am going to submit this. I wonder what happens if I didn't type for twenty minutes. what if I don't get credit. maybe I’ll keep going for another minute. I checked my mailbox when I came in, and I didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on Friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. I think I am running out of things to say, so I’ll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line. 
__label__label0 I'm thinking ORGNAME being tired. It's been a long weekend, Mama was a great lady. I loved PROPNAME and ORGNAME. Too bad I didn't attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I could be there now. I love snow. My 0st snowman on the top of Pap's truck. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are on their walk. The dog was asleep the whole trip home because of, Labor day weekend, LOCNAME was almost empty, I don't know my way around LOCNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I'm so glad that my phone line is working now. 0-0 service days. I can't understand you lady. It's been 0 minutes. My hand is beginning to hurt. I heard winter is going to be harsh, burning trailer on the side of the freeway - WHATEVER - LOCNAME nurse was a bimbo that got in our way. Mom and Dad. Disney and Daisy dog. The Ranch - I haven't been there in a while. I still need some books. AHHHHHH. I need a job because I'm about to run out of money. It's been ten whole minutes. I'm 0/0 done. PROPNAME, "I love you!"  come home in Sept. My b-bay. Friday the 00th next year. I hate horror movies, PROPNAME PROPNAME under the blanket, PROPNAME is a *****. My mouse pad is ugly. teddy bear computer as a graduation present. WHATEVER - I need a CD rack PMS curtain san finally be finished. GOD. green light is on the computer, annoying. I wonder what everyone else thinks about when they write this. paper 0st is definitely better KEYS. Ohh-la-la, Sexy!!  Why is there a screwdriver on my desk? I don't even own Only 0 minutes! I see you. I think Mars is what did you say?  Where did that turn the page over. I'm done with that side. A hole in the paper, spiral. crystal clock, I hope pimples on my chin I say a car down the driveway. NO-I need to pictures are taken all day long. Keyhole. Paper is almost running out. Write smaller. OK?  Orange is not a good color. Wish there was another sometime. Oh, I'm almost done the clock says 0:00 PM. on labor day. School tomorrow. BYE-BYE!!! 
__label__label0 sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. I’m pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. I’m doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. I’m not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much I’ll have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 0 o'clock. extra study. the ORGNAME unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. I think that's time I hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing. 
__label__label0   I am so glad that I came home this weekend. I really miss all of my friends and family. I feel like I need to be studying for some of my classes right now. I want to but I also want to spend time with my family. I need to go shopping today. I still need to buy an answering machine and some shower shoes. I really like ORGNAME, but I just feel so lonely sometimes. I am so used to being in high school and seeing all of my friends every day. I am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when I needed it. I really miss them. Now most of them have gone so far away and I won't see them for a long time. I am so happy that I got to see PROPNAME yesterday. I had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if I had never left. I can't believe all the things that she told me yesterday that I had never knew before. I am nervous about going back to class on Tuesday. I am so afraid that I am not going to do well in college, but I really want to . I feel like I am already behind because I have alot to do. I am starting to get hungry now. I haven't eaten all day and my stomach is starting to hurt. I can't believe that Princess PROPNAME died. It is so hard to believe. I feel so bad for her kids. I feel like I have so much to do today, but I don't know where to start. I am so tired. I want to go back to sleep. I want to go out and do something tonight. I haven't gone out in so long, and I am tired of staying home every night. I don't want to sit at home and watch TV again. I wonder if mom and dad are going to go somewhere again tonight. I hope that they don't. I would rather them just stay home with me. I wonder why PROPNAME is acting so weird. Sometimes he is nice to me, but then sometimes he won't even talk to me. I really don’t want to buy anything today. I have been spending so much money and I feel like I am running out. Maybe mom and dad will help me out and pay for a few things. I wish that the rest of my friends were here. I really miss them. When me and PROPNAME were talking about them yesterday, it made me miss them even more. Now I am feeling like I was on Friday. I was in such a dreary mood because I felt so alone. I wish I could see more people that I knew at LOCNAME. I wish that my parents would stop nagging me all of the time. Sometimes I feel that I can never do anything to please them. I ready to go back to LOCNAME. I can’t study when I am at home. There are too many thing to distract me from doing it. I am really hungry now. I think that I will go and get something to eat. 
__label__label1   It has taken me a few minutes to get the hang of things. Meaning, I didn't know the steps in getting set up to use the computer because I really have never had that much experience in using the computer. I went to set my e-mail account  yesterday and also got my IF account number. Let me see what else comes in mind I have no idea but to keep typing. Oh ya here with me is PROPNAME who is a senior and is helping me get to know my way around campus and also answering any questions I have over school. I am planning to go to the football game this weekend I am still not sure, because my friends don't know if they would rather go to  the football game or go home to LOCNAME for the weekend. I myself would rather go to the game. I almost forgot that I have to go to my apartment and clean up and then I have to go to the bookstore to return a book that I don't need. Well what else can I write about. . my twenty minutes are almost up but not quite yet. . . I am here staring at other people in the room looking for familiar faces but I don't see one. . . . . Something that just came  to my head was that I really miss my family, especially my mom. My sisters,  and brother mean a lot to me too, oh ya my nephew also is someone I miss a  whole lot. He is the most adorable kid I have ever seen I not saying this  because he is my nephew but because it is true. Time up. 
__label__label1 Ok, I'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. ORGNAME is on in the background, and I'm remembering when I went to see them in concert at LOCNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME ,IL. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I came from IL all the way to LOCNAME. I don't feel crazy though. I wanted a change and I really love it down here. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing right now. She isn't answering my e-mail. Ok, it's only been a day , I'm just being impatient. Anyway, I wonder why she doesn't go by PROPNAME. I like it a whole lot better than PROPNAME. And I seriously wonder if she's straight or not. I just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. I hate PROPNAME. They're such one hit wonders. And the one hit is called MMMMMBop. How incredibly stupid is that? They're like a younger , related New Kids. Speaking of New Kids, how about Spice Girls? There's another total lack of talent engineered for success. It's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. What's a great idea? That commercial just said something was a great idea. I know what a great idea would be: if I would start to do my Calculus homework. Sometimes I wonder if I actually want to pass that class. I wonder what I could do to welcome PROPNAME-my roommate-back home after this weekend. God, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. I guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand that level of dependence. Then again I moved from LOCNAME, IL to LOCNAME, LOCNAME with exactly eight minutes of crying. I wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so funny. I love this commercial. Whoever had the idea of having PROPNAME PROPNAME in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. God, I hope Jewel doesn't come on . That one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. I do miss them , but I don't really miss my parents all that much . PROPNAME is always telling me how cold that is , but I can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how I feel. Ok, Jewel did come on, but at least it was just YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME, OOPS I just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. I'm so dumb with computers, I swear. I know so much less about them than all the people around me. I'm confident I'll learn, but I just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. Daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her Plan 0 group. She's really screwy. She doesn't even know if her computer is a PC or a Mac. I guess I'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am I supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. Oh well. PROPNAME's on now. I saw him in concert too. Oh, that just made me a little sad. We all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang FRESHMEN together, and , I don't know. I feel like I'm babbling, but I guess that's pretty much the whole point. I remember Dr. PROPNAME telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. Well, I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. I 'm not really saying much of anything. I don't even feel like I'm saying anything important. I wonder if I should have put on that survey thing that I was bisexual. Not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because I could upset the demographics of their study. Oh well, I'll let them deal with that. Time's up. I hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this. 
__label__label1 I really don't like doing homework. How many hours of my life have been                                                                                                   spent doing homework? I'm sure the  number is unreal. Of course the only time I actually think about mundane things like how many hours I've spent doing homework  is when I'm doing something really boring like. well  homework. Its really warm in my room. I guess I'll have to go down and  get another maintenance request form. There's something seriously wrong with  our air-conditioning which is just not a good thing in LOCNAME, LOCNAME  in the summer. The last time the maintenance man came, he turned the vents down toward the floor. This was his ingenious plan. Great. Needless to  say, that didn't work. So back down to the dorm office I go. Joy of my life. I really wish I was in the mountains. We missed our hiking trip  this summer because we were to busy  showing horses. We went to Canadian  Nationals, but surprise, the horse show was located in the only existing  ugly portion of LOCNAME. Oh well, I'll have to focus on our Christmas  skiing trip and think of the cold snow as I sit in my sweltering room. Well twenty minutes is up. I'm gone.  
__label__label0 This seems hard to do. I am not exactly sure just what I am thinking . The music I’m hearing is not bad shit at all. there is this girl I liking her. she is cool as shit . I’m anticipating going to a soulfood party in a little while . I finally feel like I am on top of things this and the girl put in a fan-freakin -tastic mood . thinking thinkin I hope me and my roommate stay friends and we don't want to rip each others heads off  by the end of the year nas is cool . is that what I am hearing ? not sure. I am afraid of computers . I wish this dam assignment could have been done on loose-leaf no. the theory about computers- I don't want to learn how to use computers because they will eventually be so easy to use you could be a paraplegic(spelled that wrong) with no arms (chino) and still work one. 00 minutes seems long . this ain't that bad  I hope no one reads this if so how is it (mobb deep) going take a break or a leak 00 this assignment can't be done wrong can it? my friend keeps putting on different hip hop in the back ground. purple haze home beer I have not drank nearly as much liquor as I wanted to  since I got here or as much as I used to back home you can't drink in the streets here and all those other rules are really retarded . is that dela soul ? ---yes  niceah that girl  my neighbor to say the least . that would be cool as shit if it lasted  hip hop find it man or no wait up play biggie smalls that song that starts off with his beeper going off I can't type someone finally agrees with my theory on computers walker is an arrogant bastard . !!!! sucka after that put on the one I want to hear yeah  time is almost up uuuu this song I was good wu tang mystery what must go on I want to stop now  I can not type for skit it has been twenty minutes?

__label__label0 I am in this big state of confusion. Everything toward school work right now is going easy but all my feelings for my friends and my boyfriend are burning inside of me. I feel as if my classes are going to turn right around on me and kick me  in the butt. I don't know if I should stress out about them or later. PROPNAME is  starting to act like a jerk. I hope he hasn't found someone else. I broke up  with him last night because of the way he has been treating me. I regret it but  I feel as if I did the right thing. I am so confused! Eventually I will get back with him. Boy do I miss him. My legs are very sore from lifting weights yesterday I hope that my legs get in shape. I really want to lose weight. I feel very fat sometimes. Well my cousin PROPNAME is coming down from the ORGNAME this weekend. Should I go home to see him or stay here?  I know if I go home I will probably call PROPNAME  and we will probably call PROPNAME and we will get back. I guess my cousin going  home can be an excuse for me to go down and talk to PROPNAME. Another reason to go down home is for PROPNAME's license plates. Again that is another excuse. Lately PROPNAME has been on the phone all the time making me mad because I want to use the phone also. G-whiz my legs are hurting. I really need to find a job here around campus. I want to work in the library but hopefully there won't be any hassles. PROPNAME my neighbor is crazy. Him and his  girlfriend are really cute together. Why can't PROPNAME and I be like them. Both PROPNAME and PROPNAME love to work out. Whenever I go I go with them. Well actually I have been  going everyday with them. I need money!! This show that is on is weird. I have listening  to it while I am writing. It is making me sad. Well I better go my time is up.      
__label__label1 So many things I need to get done this week. All of the thinking and remembering gets stressful, but at the same time it's so much fun to be on my own. I had a great workout today at World's Gym. I feel bad that I couldn't do a step aerobics class, but their schedule didn't blend well with mine. Tomorrow I will accomplish more. I think my day and my feelings are dependent on the amount of exercise I get. I love the feeling when I'm lying in bed at night that I ate very healthy and gave my heart a great workout. I wonder if I'll be happiest being a nutritionist. I've never been able to put my finger on exactly what I want to be. It makes me wonder about those people who become something great and recall in an interview that it's what they wanted to do their whole life, since they could remember. Could that actually be?  I know I've wanted to be very successful since I could remember. I've always wanted enough money to buy without thinking twice about my purchase. At around thirteen or so I decided that becoming a doctor was my goal and nothing could stop me. Now, in actuality, it's possible. I've always made the grades excelling in math and science. I do know it takes a great deal more, but I feel I'm moving in the right direction. My ultimate question is, did I set my goal on becoming a doctor at such a young age because of that profession's stereotype?  Doctors have lots of money and great cars, and I wonder if that's what made me so determined?  But, at the same time biology is my favorite topic to study. I have this strong love for the learning channel when they're showing a surgical procedure. Nothing can take me away from the TV. But possibly it's my subconscious telling me that I need to love it?  I think I'm thinking about the whole thing a little too hard. I need to start going with the flow of things instead of always feeling I need to have my agenda totally planned out. I feel so much better if I've sat down and scheduled my next day. Sometimes I follow the schedule minute by minute, and sometimes I don't. It really doesn't bother me either way if I actually stick to the whole thing. I'm noticing my times up and I almost feel sad. No ones probably going to read this whole thing, or maybe not at all. But I now see why people find diaries therapeutic. This is just like having a diary. I like it and it made me feel better than I did 00 minutes ago. Thanks, whoever! 
__label__label1 Okay, I’m not so sure where to begin. only that I feel betrayed. betrayed by a friend that I valued. I don't understand how it happened, but I know that things will never be the same again. I sort of thought that college might bring us closer together, but I have discovered that no matter where we are, he is a million miles away. I used to think I could get through to him, but I guess I was wrong. my friends tell me he is a part of the past, and that I should look to the future, but right now I think he just breaks my heart. perhaps I’m thinking a little to much about this. I just need to get over it. until I do, I won't be able to connect with others because I’m not reachable right now. my friends all warned me this would happen, but, as usual, I wouldn't listen. I just can't help it, I want to do things my own way. do I understand myself? no. sometimes I think that I am a total psycho and I’m surprised I haven't scared people off already. I've met some nice people, but I’m just not open for new friends right now, which is such a bad idea at this point in my life. well, it's not that I’m not open to making new friends, it's that I have to let go of the past before I can pursue anything else. the trouble is that I know he is not thinking about this as much as I am. perhaps that is what hurts me the most. just knowing that our friendship meant more to me than to him. I talk to his friend, and his friend says to give it time. I’m trying to, I swear. I’m entirely too emotional about these things, I guess. I miss my best friends. I need someone to talk to. I’m not sure about this whole sorority thing, but maybe I’ll find my friends there. who knows?  thank God all those girls don't fit the sorority stereotype. that would be hell. but some of them are actually very cool. that makes me feel better because when I first met them all, I was scared shitless. I was so afraid, I almost cried. sometimes I think about what I’m getting myself into, and I get scared again, but not like that. I’ve never been scared like that. this such a scary place for me right now. maybe if I felt secure with my friends. I just think that this one guy will never really talk to me again, and it bothers me a lot. I just need to find something else to occupy my time. I really think he thinks I’m a psycho. I’ve got to stop thinking about this. remember what PROPNAME said: don't try to force things, if it's meant to be, it will happen. I’m trying to keep that in mind, Ash. I guess everything is up to God at this point. it's all a matter of trust. At times I’m just not willing to let someone else handle it. I’ve just got to let go. of everything. this guy is not the only thing I’ve been worrying about. I worry about my best friends. all of us at different schools. I think about what they're doing and if they're drunk right now or scared. sometimes I worry about myself. I kind of have a low self esteem. this sounds strange, but I think I like it. not liking myself. I think, in a way, it keeps you from getting arrogant. but on the other hand, maybe that, too, is a different kind of arrogance. thinking about yourself all the time, whether it be good or bad. why can't I reach you?  where are you?  I've got to stop thinking about things. the trouble with me, is that I don't obsess over many things, but the ones I do, it's often and it totally eats away at my life. it can kill me pieces at a time. I’ve lost my appetite and sometimes my desire to go out. but when I’m sitting there, holed up in my room feeling sorry for myself, I know that the rest of the world is moving on without me. especially here. at college. where no one cares. oh, ORGNAME 00 is on the radio. that song really "Push" really hits me. some songs make me cry if they fit a particularly depressing aspect of my life well enough. I want to connect with other people the way that song connects with me. I just need to keep an open mind and get out there and do it. PROPNAME told me once that I need to get off my butt and do things because I’m not always going to get an invitation. this reminds me of PROPNAME off in LOCNAME. I'm so glad PROPNAME called to see if I could come home for Tim's birthday. I guess the relief lies in the security that comes from anything associated with Pre-college. but I wouldn't go back if I could. I was the one of my friends saying how excited I was to leave. and I was. I’m glad I’m here, but now that I’m here, I don't know what to do. I really like this stream of consciousness stuff, and this is not because I’m trying to kiss butt or anything, it's just that I write a lot of stuff like this to let off steam. it's my own form of closure for the problems in my life. I’m thinking about going into journalism, but who knows?  it was the ORGNAME last week. I think that if you don't have anyone to talk to, you have to at least write things down. I’m starting to be friends with PROPNAME. I hope we get to be good friends. the trouble with college is that people all know that everyone needs friends, but you can't be best friends with everyone. the friend that you find that you really relate to is rare. I’m still searching. I feel like I’m PROPNAME PROPNAME in Catcher. this kills me.  
__label__label1 well, here I am in my computer lab in kinsolving. I just finished emailing my  boyfriend. I really hate writing him sometimes because he never responds as much as I do. then again he is in LOCNAME and still in high school and probably doesn't have as much to say as I do. oh well that's life. god why the hell did I wait  until the last minute to write this. I should have done this last week. well, then again I did. but the stupid computer didn't send it. so now I have to retype  all that crap again. life sucks! well, it is not that bad, but to me it is. I really  wanted to go home this weekend. my cousins re so stupid for not going. what the hell!! now I have to depend on someone else or I have go to their house this weekend. the last thing I want to do I spend a night there with that stupid sima. damn does that girl have a mouth or what. I can't believe that she made all that stuff up about mayur and me. I hope paras doesn't get mad about me emailing about that. god, he believes everything that I tell him. I know that he is wooped in a way. just because he doesn't drive around everywhere for me doesn't mean that he loves  me any less. or just because I drive to his house a lot, doesn't mean that I  control the relationship. well actually I know that it probably would not have  lasted this 0 months if had not driven up there 00 times. do you know how many miles that is? take 00 times 00 miles each trip. that is a lot of mileage that I put on all the cars. I hope he appreciates everything I do for him. actually, I know that  he does. he is the most perfect person in the world. he has never caused any grief in my life. if anything has gone wrong it is because of his stupid parents. why the hell won't they give him a break? I mean, what the hell is wrong with them? that boy deserves a car more than any other child. I hope to god that comes to LOCNAME next year. that would be the bomb!!! we would be like living together. but I hope we  don't break up like all the other couples that come here and do. they have it made,  don't they realize that!! I guess being around a person all the time can be a  little too much. but that's the thing, I don't think that I could ever get tired of seeing paras. I haven't gotten tired after this long what would change  my mind now. oh well, we’ll see when the time comes. I hope we're still together then. I really don't know what would give either of us a reason to break up. I mean he adores the ground I walk on and I love him for that. just joking. I adore him just as much if not more. I mean, that's why my room is like a shrine to him. anyway, my time is almost up and I have to go get ready for neesh's b-day party thing. what the hell do I wear? I guess I’ll decide in a minute.    
__label__label0 I am currently sitting in the computer lab in the lobby of Jester. I have just finished my final class for the day, so I figured that I would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. I have never taken any kind  of psychology class, so I don't really know what to expect. Hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and I wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. I liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that I was still in it. I sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. I went home for the Labor Day holidays and partied with them, but now that I'm back in LOCNAME everything has changed back again. I haven't really met many people since I've been here, but I can say that there are quite a few weird people. Hopefully I will get use to LOCNAME soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. I've  already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since I moved in two weeks ago. My parents aren't too happy with me right  now, so I've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. I keep screwing  up on this computer and don't really know what I'm doing. I never have been too good with computers-even though I have taken several classes in high school. I  can type rather quickly, but that is about all. My fingers are getting tired of typing because I haven't typed all summer. I guess I need to get use to it since I'm going to be doing a lot of it now that I'm in college. I'm not too happy  right now because I have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. I just  brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but I can't get the CD-ROM to work. The stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so I haven't been able to hook up the UT Connect package that I just bought. I think I made a few people mad when I went to purchase that UT Connect package because  there was a long line and I sort of cut to the front on accident. I was just  trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought  that I had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. Even though the guy that I cut in front of looked kinda pissed, I wasn't about to turn around and  get at the back of the line. Last week I waited in it over an hour and even  though I feel kinda bad for that guy, it was worth it. My eyes are getting tired of staring at this screen and I'm for my time to be up. I guess I still have a  few minutes until dinner starts so I'll write for a little while longer. I didn't get much sleep last night because I just couldn't fall asleep for some reason. Some friends and I watched the movie The Program, and that lasted until about 0:00, and I still couldn't go to bed after that. I didn't have to wake up until 00:00, but I only had like 0 hours of sleep. Hopefully I can go to bed tonight with no problem. My hands are getting a little sweaty from typing so much, but I really do like to type. I'm not all familiar with the internet and the web, but  I would like to be. I'm in an English lab class, so that will probably help me out a lot. I'm sitting next a guy that can type about 000 words a second-at least that's what it sounds like-and it is kind of getting on my nerves. 
__label__label0 I really have no idea what to write about. I am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. It feels like I have just been on vacation and am home now. Some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but I took some allergy medicine and I have no desire to dance. The medicine makes me so tired. My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. She only does that when she is upset about something. I guess she misses me. We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. She was a wonderful dog. I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to LOCNAME tomorrow. That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. I had to sell my horse before I left for college. I had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. I still haven't sold all of my equipment. I can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. Princess PROPNAME died in a car accident this morning. I really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but I guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. Anyway, I think it is really really sad. I especially feel so bad for her children. I was watching 00 Minutes on TV a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. My brothers and I used to fish a lot with the family too. It is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. One of them is 00 and the other one is almost 00. That is hard to believe. I just turned 00 on Friday. It was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. I am also glad I came home because that way, I can be sure that I keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. I want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. I am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. I think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where I used to live in LOCNAME. She told me that a girl I used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. It was so shocking and really sad. I mean, I didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since I had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. My roommate at Towers is really cool. I am glad we get along. I was worried I might get some freak. I can just imagine that if I had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. Twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I think I still have a few minutes left. I think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. Sometimes they are really, really loud. We used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. Well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. It was in the middle of the night and I heard her running around the house like a freak. Finally I got up to see what was wrong and I took the trap off of her. The mouse appeared to be dead so I put it in a baggy but when I got up in the morning, I found out it was still alive so I tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so I put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. It finally got better so I let it go. I had to let it go far away from my house though  because my mom was afraid it would come back in. My cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in LOCNAME. It was so sad. I cried everyday until we finally found her again. I think my twenty minutes is up now. 
__label__label0 I guess I won't be looking forward to this weekend. Why? I won't be going home. At least I'll be able to get some work done if I stay here. It's hard to concentrate at home because there are so many distractions. All I know is that I have to focus on my  studies. This feels weird just babbling on. I don't even know where this is even heading. I feel like such a fool sitting here typing up things on this screen that don't even  make sense. I'm stuck. Okay, never mind, I'll think of something to say. At least  I should be happy that I was able to get access to this computer. Stuck again. It's amazing how  when I'm asked to say things, I usually don't know what to say. This feels weird. Maybe the next time  I do this, I should do it in a private place, so people won't be wondering what the heck I'm doing or constantly looking over at my screen to catch a glimpse of what it is I'm doing here. Who cares anyway. I can't believe have so much work to do when I get back. Forget about that for now. I'll deal with that later. I wish I wouldn't procrastinate sometimes. This assignment is so similar to the one that I had to do everyday in my high school sophomore English class. I couldn't believe all the things I had written. I think this guy sitting next to me is getting annoyed. He's making some sort of grunting sounds. Oh well, I guess he'll have to put up with it for  another ten minutes. I'm so nervous about tomorrow. Going out to join the tennis club. I haven't played in awhile. I hope  they have plenty of extra balls because they might be losing a few tomorrow. I need the exercise anyway. 
__label__label0 Well right now I have to go to the bathroom but I can't because I'm doing my assignment. I am also very hungry I drank an orange juice for breakfast and I didn't eat much for lunch So now food is on my mind. I have to go to my dorm and read a lot because I haven't read anything for any of my classes including psy (oops! should I have written that!??) I also hope that I get a job at ORGNAME's on the drag. I would have to work early in the morning but I really need money right now because I am so broke. I feel awful because of all the expenses my mother has to pay. I just want to help out a bit. I need to go exercising I went to the gym yesterday for about 00 minutes and I went walking for about an hour. I am, trying to lose weight for this  dorm function on the 00th all these girls are going to be in these skimpy bathing suits and usually wear a T-shirt over mine. Not this time!! I'm gonna wear a bathing suit without a T-shirt what an accomplishment that will be!! I still have to go to the bathroom. Not real bad it's just  like this nagging pain in my bladder (sorry that's kinda gross!) But that's exactly what I'm thinking! My shoulder hurts. It feels sore, my right one. Not from typing I think It's from walking last night. It was really weird because my fingers got swollen from all the blood rushing into them while I was walking last night. I felt really good because I was getting lots of exercise. I'm also glad because I quit smoking I  never really started but I smoked 0 then 0,0,0,0,0,0!! and that's when I decided that It was a bad habit and  I didn't want to get addicted. There are some many wonderful things to look forward to lung cancer, smoker's hack, bad breath, smelly clothes and emphysema! Besides my mother would kill me before and of those other things got to. My dad smoked and he finally quit. But know he smokes cigars occasionally I told him to quit so now I'm taking my own advice. The minute I finish I going to the bathroom and after that I'm going to go EAT  I'm starving' food, food, I want food. After that I'll do my Lab, study, take a bath and go to bed. I can't wait!! Well I'm not really looking forward to the studying part but that's the reason  I'm here!! Well I've come to the end of my twenty minutes so I guess I'll have to say. . ADIOS!!!  
__label__label1 It is quiet in my room, PROPNAME is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at PROPNAME's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 0 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 0 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of LOCNAME but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . . 
__label__label1 the end of this song is so weird. what was PROPNAME on when he thought of it. now this song is pretty cool. it bumps. too bad my sax solo was gay. I think that funk is the coolest type of music. I can't believe that maceo parker is  playing at antones. I am so there. I can't believe I remembered the number man, I wish I could get rid of my damn computer virus. what a pain. my knee hurts. I so stupid for busting it. I think that my dorm room has to be the coolest in jester. jeff is such a pimp. too bad he sounds kind of white. PROPNAMEsh is the coolest though. he's just about the funkiest drummer I’ve ever played with. I don't know if I’m supposed to be pressing enter, but if I don't I start writing off of the screen. I think that I’m gonna like psychology. it's pretty interesting. I hope my stereo is bugging anybody. the concert tonight is gonna be cool. I just hope that I don't get killed. this song  cracks me up. I gotta leave in 00 minutes. I better have a lot of sugar to keep me awake. I can't believe how tired I was last night. maybe I should  have slept over at the girls place. I got to record my CD and send it to b. I’ve gotta find out when I need to take defensive driving. these pizza rolls are so good. man, jester food sucks. the only good thing is the cereal. salads are ok. the pizza is decent too. my new hat sucks. it's really  uncomfortable. my brother is so whipped. me and my twin brother aren't really a lot alike. he is so disgusting when he's around his girlfriend. I guess that keyboarding class paid off. paid or paid. ly or lie. die or. . . well maybe not. what the hell am I talking about. this is a pretty crazy assignment. over half way done. it pisses me off when my posters fall off of my wall. CD’s over. what do I want now. how 'bout a little screaming headless torsos. they are the coolest. PROPNAME jo PROPNAME is the most amazing drummer in the world. too bad I can't go to the first game. I still gotta get that sports package. some much to do, so little time. almost done now. my mind has gone blank. I’ve got to wash my clothes. if I don't do that tomorrow, I’m gonna smell all damn week. I’ve got to read a lot this weekend. this is boring. I’m sure who ever might read this cares very little about what I’m saying. oh well. looks like my time is up now. just gotta push the submit button. bye. 
__label__label1 okay I’m writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 00:00 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if I’ll get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope I’m not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 00:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 00 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I don’t want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school I’m looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that I’m in a sorority, not that I’m not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean I’m no longer PROPNAME (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so I’d rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 00:00 boy I’ve never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if I’ll be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still haven’t attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 0 foot 0 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 00 and I’m not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because I’ve risen before 00:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 0 hours of sleep I’m one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if I’m wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, I’m so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that I’m off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 00:00 and I’m signing off! 
__label__label0 I don't really know how to start this but I guess it really doesn’t matter Computers are so frustrating. I wish I knew more about them. Its 0:00 now so I need to write until hmmmm 0:00. That’s not to bad. I wonder what that guy keeps laughing about, It must be some really fun assignment or maybe he’s on email with some girl or something. He pretty cute, kind of looks like the guy on  The Princess Bride. I love that movie , haven’t seen it in a while. This assignment is kind of hard because I cant type as fast as I think. Oh, this is how this thing works. Kind of annoying You cant even see what your writing! How dumb. I wonder what PROPNAME is writing I hope my email got to PROPNAME and PROPNAME. That would stink if it didn’t. What time is it anyway?  0:00 00 more minutes. There sure is alot of people here for a Friday afternoon. I wonder if I'll be  in here alot doing homework. Probably. I'm kind of tired. I hope gosh I'm hungry. I hope that HOPE is fun tonight. I want to meet some people . I hope PROPNAME comes I wonder if PROPNAME or PROPNAME called. I bet PROPNAME did for sure. I wish he was more  talkative but he's really nice. I bet PROPNAME kind of likes PROPNAME. I wonder if  I'm going to be able to get out of this computer without having to have that  weird guy help me again. I felt so dumb. I need to do my research requirement  soon so I don’t get behind. There's a lot I need to do. That guy is laughing again. I kind of wish I could just laugh back at him. Gosh I'm a really slow typer. I hope I'm doing this right. I wish all my assignments were this easy. I need a floppy disk and oh yeah I need to get those Paradigm notes for Zoology. I bet PROPNAME doesn’t remember to bring me hers. Oh well. She's really nice. I wonder where that girl is from. She has a funny accent. I think I've written for about 00 minutes  now so I guess I'll quit even though I don’t have very much typed out . I'm just slow. Besides they didn’t say this had   to be a certain length just a 00 min. time frame. I wonder what’s for dinner tonight. I think I'll go find out. 
__label__label1 I returned to LOCNAME Monday night at about 00:00 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was PROPNAME and the source of her angst was my best friend PROPNAME. They, as I am, are both from LOCNAME. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for ORGNAME. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. PROPNAME declares she is "so totally over PROPNAME" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to PROPNAME, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in LOCNAME. She has a lot of frustration with PROPNAME, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. PROPNAME's feelings toward PROPNAME are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions PROPNAME is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be "friends", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto PROPNAME as a friend. PROPNAME's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 00 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both PROPNAME and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to Huge UT ORGNAME life challenging. Thank you. 
__label__label1 As I sit here and drink this very nasty coffee. (coffee maker is on the fritz) I look back and recollect on this past weekend. In fact this has been my only thought since Monday morning. So I can give you can better understand what I am talking about, I will give you  a background premise to what occurred. I was sitting on the computer, as always, talking to my boyfriend in LOCNAME on a chat group. He and I are still in that "newlywed" phase of a relationship, so we are constantly wanting to be around the other. My having to be a couple hundred miles away in school is causing major distance pains. Any way, I was trying to encourage him to come visit me for the weekend. He was regretfully working on both Saturday, and Sunday lunches ( he is a waiter, where we met this past summer) . He replied to my requests with a request for me to go down there. I thought about it for a brief moment, decided that I had no major plans for the weekend, and immediately called Greyhound. I was on the next bus home, in one hour. He was so completely surprised. As he put it, it was one of the largest signs of love that he had ever been shown, for someone to just up and leave on the spur of a moment, spend over $00 that he knew I didn't have to spend, sacrifice a weekend of my time, just to see him. He was on cloud nine, and as soon as I saw him, so was I. Well the weekend progressed, and I had a wonderful time. I also had a chance to meet up with my friends still in LOCNAME, without having to report in to my mother. thankfully I neglected to tell her that I was in town. Well, on my last day there, before my ride to the bus station, he and I had a heartfelt conversation. He basically proclaimed his undying love for me, and told me exactly how special I was in his life. He also went over all the things that I did to let him know how much he knew that I love him. He remembered all the little things that I have done since day one. which really meant something to me cause I know that my actions are received with such appreciation. He felt that this last one, my coming to see him on the spur of a moment, was the ultimate. He then proceeded to tell me of a mental list that he had of who he envisioned his wife would be, what kind of person she would be, and what her traits would be. He told me that I fit every one, and he said that I was his perfect companion. Both of us have seen a lot, and have dated almost every type of person out there. I know that he is the one for me, I have known it for a while. I have been told that when you meet that certain someone, you will know it is them, and you will know that they are the right one for you. Well. my mind, heart and soul are screaming at me that PROPNAME is him. Well, I stated a few things to him that I had been thinking about, and at one point,  I started to cry, out of sheer joy at what he was saying to me, I have never had any one person ever express their feelings to me, and I don't think I have ever experienced love at this level. I was so happy that the tears just came. Oh. to explain the next thing, I want you to know that we have talked, hypothetically about marriage several times in the past. but it was usually never in a fully serious tone, only half serious. but each of us was contemplating it. When he saw me crying, he embraced me so tightly, and with such warmth I felt at totally peace, at that moment, he whispered (and I still don't know if I was meant to hear t or not) that he had "finally found his wife". he pulled back from the embrace, looked so deep into my eyes that it felt as if he touched my soul, and right then and there, asked me to be his wife. I was soo taken aback that I couldn’t speak. I have never been proposed to, and wasn't sure how to respond. All I could do was smile one of the biggest smiles I have ever made, and I replied yes. He said that he was completely serious. no hypothetical at all. he also said that he would ask me again, but this time, would present me with a ring. I know that it could be a while before he can get up the money for that. but I am willing to wait for a man like that. I have never meat anyone quite like him. I have only been in love 0 times before. one lasted for 0 years. but it ended as an abusive relationship. the second was only a one sided love. He was leaving for the ORGNAME, and didn't want to return the love because he knew that he would come out a different person. But both times cannot even compare to my feelings for PROPNAME. Now I come to my contemplations. I had plenty of time to think about my life and where it was going on the bus ride home. I know that I want to spend my life with PROPNAME, he and I share the same values, we are both religious people in our own ways. we may not go to church regularly, but we are both at peace with God and what He asks of us. I have never met anyone that was religious and not afraid to admit it, but he isn't overly religious to the point that I am disgusted. :O)  We both have the same values regarding marriage. in effect, neither of us believes in divorce. Marriage is for all time, and if you marry a person then it is forever. "'til death do you part"  I know that this could work. The biggest obstacle that I can see is the age gap. he is 00, I am 00. It hasn't posed a problem for us before, my mother likes him, and sees that he shows acceptable behavior, and treats me with the utmost respect. He never belittles me, or disregards what I say because I am young. In fact he looks up to me because I have set such high goals for myself, and will stop at nothing to achieve them. He also knows that I want to wait until graduation, or at least close to it, before I get married. And he knows how important Med-school is to me. He also says that he will not marry me until he knows for sure that he can support me. he is one of those chivalrous guys, that believes that a man should be able to support a family on his salary alone. but if his wife wants to work, or even makes more money than him, then he is all for it. he just wants to be able to know that I don't have to work. At the same time, he is giving me more support about being a doctor than any other person. including my family.  One thing that bothers me is that he is 00 and still a waiter. I know that it is only temporary, he is working for a career in music, either with a band, as a musical engineer/producer, or as a teacher (he is one of the best drummers I have heard. and writes INCREDIBLE music. everything from piano pieces, to synthesized complete modern music. he can do it all!!!!  I know that with my income alone, we can make it. even starting out, being a doctor will be able to support us. The problem could arise in the fact that we will be in debt for a while, paying off med-school, and it would be a shaky start. But of course all marriages start out financially shaky. I am also concerned that because he is so much older, and more ready to settle down, that he will encourage me to marry before I graduate. that would just be another added expense. By the time I graduate, he will be 00. I just hope that he can wait that long. he says that he can, and that he will, I believe him, but he may grow antsy as the years go on.  Bottom line is that I love him, and will do anything in the world for him, but of course within reason. I also know that he would do the same for me, without even needing me to ask. I have never felt this way about any other human being. and I don't think that another love like this is possible. besides I don't want any one else but him. soo. Yes, I will marry him. and we will have beautiful children. We know that once this "honeymoon" feelings wear off. our love for each other will change. but as I know my love, I will still be there. by his side. I have never met anyone that completes me, and who I am, so perfectly as he does. not even my best friend. PROPNAME and I connect we realized this when we first met, and had our first deep discussion. In fact we connected to each other so well. that it scared both of us. and with reason. when you meet someone and the next week you can complete each other sentences. and already know what the other is thinking without them having to say a word, it can be a bit scary. But as we grew, we grew more comfortable with the idea. and now he is ready to marry me. my life couldn’t be more perfect, and I couldn't be any more happier. I am in love. and now, I am engaged!! 
__label__label0 Stream of Consciousness  Well here I am. I wonder why the professor asked us to do this? I had to do this once before. I can't remember what class it was for. I think it was for English class. I liked my English teacher. I think her name is Mrs. PROPNAME. She was a good teacher. She sounded when she read to us. I'm glad I took that dual credit English class, now I don't have to take English in college. That is one less thing to worry about. I wonder if I turned off the oven? Oh yeah, I did. I can't believe I left the refrigerator open all night. I'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. I just bought it. At least I don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. I need to buy more cereal. That new cereal is pretty good. I think those fish sticks upset my stomach. I think next time I'll buy fish fillets. I like fish and fishing. I wonder if there is any place to fish around here. I think lake PROPNAME is close but I'm not sure. Then again it be far. I don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. I think I'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. I really miss her. I hope she goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME next year so she will be closer and I can see her more often. I can't believe I have to go to ACC next semester to take college Algebra. I must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. I've already taken calculus in high school and I made an A. I can't believe I scored so low on the SAT 0 math part. I wonder if there is any more Kool-Aid left? I think there is grape, get some when I'm done. I'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. My hand is cramping. I think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. I hope I can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. I guess I'll just ask somebody. I hate to ask people things, especially directions. I think I'm done. 
__label__label1 I just got finished with my Spanish homework and now I can think in English. I don't really care for Spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language. Before that I was writing email to friends of mine at other schools. It is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them. If I didn't have email I probably wouldn't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive. I just found out that one of my friend's friend is quitting school. I don't understand that. Giving up an education seems ridiculous to me. Gold fishes are also ridiculous. My neighbor has oh wait, had two goldfish. One of them died last night. Gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish. One minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a ORGNAME commercial. I now have been writing for five minutes and I wish I could stop looking at the clock. I took a computer assisted English class last semester and I am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience. One of my projects last semester had to do with the Tick. He is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures, or nightmares, into the inner workings of his mind, he also has antenna which are referred to as those "things" on the cartoon by his cohorts. My little sister likes the tick as well but I don't think she understands alot the humor in it, most of its pretty stupid I will admit. My sister just learned how to say her ORGNAME’s in Spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone. the way she says "w" is really cute. My brother just got married this past summer and I don't know what to think of his wife, she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange. but I am not really a judge of strange since I have been called that myself a time or two. Actually I think everyone is called strange, or weird, at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing. Like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend, when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card, or package of candy. Ten minutes. It is amazing how often people look at the clock. My batteries went dead awhile back and I don't really miss it very much, granted I took my sister's PROPNAME mouse watch every now and then, in fact I think it is my room right now, but time often feels insistent and that can be stressful. Kind of like how I have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment. My calf muscles are incredibly sore and I have been complaining about them all day. My roommate said that I shouldn't complain because I was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday. Well I was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much, if I had know that this was how I was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice. 00 minutes. The ORGNAME movie awards are on tonight and I don't know if I really want to watch them or not. Its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are, I get enough of that with going to school here, just kidding. I will probably watch it anyway. My neighbors are pretty cool, even the one with minus on fish. I sure hope it didn't die because she didn't feed it, or over fed it. I don't see the purpose of a goldfish, I like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish, even though that is disgusting. I just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla, but now it is bob. What ever happened to quesadilla I will never know. I guess my dad and mom just couldn't hang with a name that made no sense. Well it made sense to me, because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant, and they have the best quesadillas there. 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 I still need to do my homework for Spanish. I'll be spending a lot of time in this building in the spring because I'll be back in design and vis comm. I'm getting hungry. tonight PROPNAME PROPNAME and I are going to get pizza. PROPNAME and I weren't getting along too well for a while. it was because I have been dating and spending less time with him. for a long time it was always just the two of us, neither one dating. now that I am it bothered him just a little bit. oh well, we talked about it and he's better now. which is good, I don't like to fight with Alex. I have a lot to do this week, tonight I need to read and I would like to work on and ,ideally, finish my calculus homework. tomorrow I am going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. I talked to one of the managers this weekend at the forum and he said that they were hiring. that would be a good place to work, at least I like the store. we'll see. I guess I need to call my sister tonight she always gets all worked up if I don't talk to her once a week. I just talked to her the other day though, sometimes I just don't feel like talking to her. I hope that someday she'll stop trying to mother me. I hope that now that she has a child she will let me be. I actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. this is my first time to take calculus so I didn't know what to expect. it is pretty interesting. I'm really getting hungry and it s going to be a couple of hours before I get to eat dinner I wish my computer at home worked it is so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. I 'm glad uncle mike is going to help me with it. mom really did a good job when she picked uncle mike to be my financial adviser ii really care for hm a lot. it is always  amazing to me that it is usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. you always are expected to help your family whether you like them or not but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things and they won't hold it over your head. unfortunately most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. I can't stand that sort of thing. 
__label__label1 I want to go to LOCNAME and dance I have not dance in a wile no time the is so much good live music here it because money though I am hopefully going to get a job I need to turn in that application tomorrow too I have a lot of stuff to do oh well I am going take it as it comes though bye. 
__label__label1 They are playing OU as I write this and I am hoping that they loose. I keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down I really want them to loose. When they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. Is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him?  I know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. This makes me extremely jealous and insecure. PROPNAME is my first love. He is the first person I ever really cared about. I don't know if I am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. There are so many more important things that I should be worrying about right now in my life. I am in my prime. I am terrified of getting hurt. I'm scared that I am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when I really need him. I can almost see history repeating itself:  in high school I stood beside PROPNAME when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where I needed someone there for me we was too good. I still have a tremendous amount of anger towards PROPNAME for the things he did to hurt me. This relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but I'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that I would be willing to lay down my life for. I don't know if I am being insecure about our relationship because of things PROPNAME has done in the past or because I feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like I am not worthy of someone liking me. 
__label__label0 I don't know if I can handle all of this. Every semester I procrasnated with only 00 hours to worry about. And for the first time, in a long time, I am facing reality and taking my school work and my life seriously. The good thing is that I have a loving mother who understands me most of the times; I have a father that I do love and who does love me, but I don't watn to get in to it; and my pride and joy is my boyfriend who I love dearly, and ORGNAME day is our first year anniversary. I have no clue what to get him. I mean we've always given each other what's in our heart (we don't like superficial stuff)--I've made many creative stuff like "two peas in a pod" with clay, paper mashad hearts for Christmas, cranes in a bottle,. and he too have made me stuff like putting our baby pictures to gether in a frame, written me poems, made a model ORGNAME ORGNAME (my favorite car last year), and he even went so far as to sew a heart for me. FOr a guy to sew is absolutely a amazing. It was so poorly put togther, some strings were loose, some parts were't even attached. etc, but it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I must have cried, partly because I was mad at him at the time because I felt that he was not thinking too much of me. Was I surprised. So here's a delinma. How can I show him what he means on our anniversary when all my ideas have been used?  Plus I only have exactly 0 days to do this?  I was originally going to draw the entire ORGNAME fairy tale characters, but he doesn't like disney. I was thinking of writing him a poem, but I'm just so much better at prose. So far, my idea is to just to write him a book with old scripture. Hopefully, with everything that I have to do this week, I'll be able to write it.  
__label__label0 Even though I am so tired from running around all day. My gosh, I have to get up at 0 this morning just because Priya's alarm goes off. After that, everything is a blur. I can't go to sleep, but have to be in the half and half stage. Terrifying. I don't like her. She is just so. weird. I mean, she would stand there and just stare outside. Doesn't she have anything else to do???  I am so tired of seeing her all day. Well, my day pretty much is over except for Psychology class. Why is the class all the way over in Jester anyway. I am tired of walking. To Jester and back. That is 00 minutes off my time. I am tired of myself also. Why do I complain so much lately. And so emotional also. I feel pity for myself, which is not cool. Hey, playing racquet ball with PROPNAME is kind of cool. I miss him so much. I think he was about to cry when I was saying good bye to him. So cute. Hmmm. something about me. Why do I want to see a guy cry all the time?  I think it is something very sexy about it. But the problem is, when they started to feel comfortable and can cry in front of you no problem, then they become too emotional. I want a man, not another "feminine" one to take care of. I want him to be my safety, no crying around me. Not too much anyway, unless there is a legitimate reason. PROPNAME was such a cry baby. So girlie I might say. Man, I think he was just crying to get my attention. Why am I thinking of that dork anyway. PROPNAME is such a nice guy. So thoughtful sometimes that I am scared I am not good enough for him. But well, that is that. Somehow, I have a feeling we will end up being together. Actually, it is not a feeling, I know we'll end up together and very happy together I might say. I wonder if he is at home now. Hey, I am typing pretty fast. It is kind of creepy when I found all those ants on my short this morning. I look like a mad woman, trying to fend off all those creeps. But the thing is, nobody knows what I am doing. All they see is a girl looking down on her short, prying the slit out. How embarrassing. Oh well, it passed. Nobody would remember me anyway. Just a girl. An ordinary girl. Nobody cares. That stupid PROPNAME. PROPNAME and I gave him $000 for his wedding and this is how he treat me?  The nerve. Not that money counts. I am not using money as a criteria. I just want him to treat me right. The way I should be treated. I mean, Thay and PROPNAME's dad had to apologize to me?  I don't want them to apologize to me. I want an apology from PROPNAME. That egg head. Actually, I don't think there is much in that head anyway. I am so mean.   Let's see. my hand is getting tired from typing all of this. Actually, I think my writing will be one of the longest ones. I think I can type pretty fast. I don't want to write anymore. My eye is so tired. I want to be somewhere else. I want to sleep. I want so many things. But the thing is, those thing that I want doesn't require money. It doesn't cost anything. So I think that this is okay. As long as I don't hurt anybody right?  These things I want are because I don't get much of it. I want PROPNAME to come to ORGNAME and be with me. But then again, if he does come, I think we will be both in trouble because we would not concentrate much on school. Okay, my head is hurting, and I am yawning. I am going to go home right after psychology, eat and then take a nap. Then wake up, take shower the go study. I have to at least get through with the Organic and physics today. My gosh, I have so many things to do. There is Organic, then there is Micro. , Physics, Physics lab. I have to return books to Co-op, and buy books. Buy class manual, then there is those Micro equipment I have to buy. rrArghhh. life as it is with me. so much to do. Why do I have to be such an overachiever???  I hate it. I wish things could just come easy to me. But then again, would life be fulfilling to me if everything I want, I get. Who cares, I would have an easy life. I am itchy again. I think it is just psychology playing on my mind again. You think you have ants on you, therefore you get itchy. rrhehehee 
__label__label0 I have finally made it to college. I miss my family and friends but at the same time I am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. It's is something new. I feel confident that I will succeed here at LOCNAME, but most importantly, I want to succeed. I am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. I sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. However, each day I feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. Above all I find myself missing someone back home who I have only known a short time the most. He is a wonderful person with whom I have this extraordinary mental connection. Being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. It makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. I am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. Well I guess I will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation. 
__label__label1 Losing my best friend the day before classes started doesn't necessarily "enhance" my college experience. So much has been circulating through my head. Why did this happen?  She and her sister had so much to live for, and now they are both dead because of a freak accident. A careless mistake took the only two children their parents will know to be their own. In a perverted way I find the situation ironic. PROPNAME had done so many stupid things in her life and come away from them without a scratch, but her sister took a turn too fast and it took both of their lives. I find myself unable to think too much about it recently. I am able to say "my best friend just died" but I haven't found it possible to truly feel the extent of pain that I do. I find myself going through the day forcing a smile here and there, a laugh if I hear something funny, but I have never had such a consistent view of the sidewalk. I am polite to the girls in my dorm, but I am somehow furious that they don't understand my pain. I wouldn't either if someone had come to me with this situation three weeks ago. No one does until it affects you personally. It's like one of those after-school specials on teen-aged depression. I find myself shutting down sometimes and hating the world. If I believed in a god, it would only be one more person to hate and blame for this. I know I need to make new friends but can only wish to see and talk to my old friends, friends that understand. I know I need to get out and do things, but the thought of socializing with strangers frustrates the hell out of me. I find myself going through phases of denial, then rage, then depression, and then denial again. Sometimes I want to put my fist through the wall, other times I want to curl up in a little ball and just stay there for weeks. Sometimes nothing seems important. What good does it do to strive for perfection if it can all be taken away that quickly?   What good does it do to have people close to your heart, if it only hurts that much more when you lose them?  Of course I know the answers to these questions, but recently I've challenged everything I have trusted to be true. 
__label__label1 I tried to get onto your pretest experimental thing and it didn't let me on that's very bad for m e since I will have to waste more damn time tomorrow doing it I heard it takes a long time to do. This whole college thing is really starting to scare me I missed my Si session today for Rtf and let myself down. I f you want to make an impression on these people you have to grab them by the balls with a 0. 0 average. How am I going to do that when I have already missed one of the damn Si's  I'm telling you I better get my act  What am I even doing here I need to get my mind on other things like movies why aren't your thoughts ever on movies they're always on what to do to impress the next person . Just get ahead of thy game early and you'll do fine  God I hope I get a $. 0. $. 0 the way to go. I don't want grad school though LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that's where I'm going to be in a while no matter what. I have it the right stuff. PROPNAME PROPNAME. Good movie. Remember what the guy at ORGNAME said The Right Stuff had god use of parallel editing. where you edit two frames together that are similar in how the shot is set so as not to disrupt the audience's attention. What is the audience's attention . Movies. this paper what am I rambling about I wonder if the proff will read this Jesus you type like a gorilla . PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in the Mist about some ape lady PROPNAME something. Ironic that was in our psychology book. ironic but not funny just ironic sue me I took a pause to see how much time I had left this is all anyway what is it supposed to prove that our mind wanders is it supposed to give us some great insight into how we think  rrAAh. it is pretty fun and it will be interesting to read over this am I supposed to wow I'm a slow typist that sucks. What was it sophomore year that I got a B in keyboarding yeah I told PROPNAME PROPNAME about PROPNAME PROPNAME and we always used to fight each other in class and he'd pretend that I was beating him up why are you and all of these people so concerned about each other especially women is it just to procreate that we are interested in women or is it like Psychology. professor says that there can be different views on the whole thing. Of course dumb question there can be different views on every thing but which is the right one?  time up 
__label__label0 By back hurts when I sit like this and I can feel the little tendon that is inflamed. I don't really have to think about each letter that I type on the keyboard I just think about what I want to say and it goes from my mind through the fingers and into the computer. I just stopped to think about what to write about next but I don't know exactly what I'm thinking so I'll write about what I just thought. my mind is telling me that it is lunch time and my stomach is agreeing. I think that I am going to eat healthy today because I have been slacking off pretty bad. I should probably eat some of the food that my parents gave me this weekend so that my roommate doesn't eat it all. Gosh my back hurts. Damn rain. LOCNAME has a lot of rain, probably more than LOCNAME I think I like usstin a lot better than LOCNAME, it is cooler here to there is not nearly as much humidity, Gosh I have a bad cough, why do I get depressed so easily I  think my problem is that I am always trying to please everybody else and not myself. I guess that is good because it is unselfish but it is my life and everybody says that life is short but see there I go listening to everybody else again. Goodness I have a cough a headache and my back is so screwed up , it sucks to go from being very active to nearly useless . My whole life has been about having fun and playing sports and now it hurts to bad just sitting here. it is amazing that I was not paralyzed, I could not imagine what it must feel like to know that you will never stand up strait or run or even walk again. that suck but I see now that my situation is not as bad as many peoples. what do I write now I wonder. I wonder how many people will be on sixth street I wonder why my nose is itching and I haven't stopped typing to scratch it . it must be a zit trying to emerge. PROPNAME if you read this you probably think that last statement is gross but I am very frank. I wonder if I am going to do good here at LOCNAME. I wonder what song that is being played down the hall so loud. I wonder if that is. Oh well the reptilian part of my brain is telling me that I have written for twenty minutes and that I should do something else. 
__label__label0 I'm not sure since I've just started College and haven't had any tests yet. I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 00 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. 
__label__label0 I have so many things going on in my life right now. PROPNAME PROPNAME, the cheerleading coach, called me yesterday and invited me to come and work out with the squad. I do not know if I am ready to cheer this semester. Right now my biggest concern is my grades. I am going into am interview on Wednesday with romie, from K-Hall agency, I love to model and I hope my career will progress in LOCNAME. Then today I called thr director over the ORGNAME ORGNAME paegent, she is going to mail me information to compete in the paegent in Feburary. All of this adds on to my never ending stress. I guess you can say "I do not like to put all my eggs in one basket", at least my mom tells me that. I like to try everything life has to offer, so I will fill satisfied. Besides all my extraciricular activities, I feel a little empty. Being a freshman I am having to deal with moving away from my family and starting a new life on my own. I finally knew I was grown up when I got my first phone bill! I really enjoy LOCNAME, it has so many things to offer. My mom misses me, we were very close. On sunday I met her in Temple and we talked. My feelings are very strong, but I know how to deal with them. I have had many obsticals in my life and I had to learn from my mistakes. I think in the long run I would not change my past. It made me grow up a lot quicker. I also feel in more mature for my age than other freshman, because of my past expirences. I can not wait to see what the future holds for me. I guess you can say I get really excited about life, because there are so many directions god has allowed me to go. I will just let him guide me, and I know I will be happy and sucessful. 
__label__label1 ever since the first day of school on august 00 I have felt so much fear. it has never hit me so hard as right now typing on a computer  not knowing one person around me yet some of them being my classmates. my thoughts of u t are hard to explain. some days are bad some good, it just depends on the day and class. I grew up in a small town went to the same school district my whole life and graduated with 00 people in my class. my psychology class has close to000. its very overwhelming . I have made a few new friends but I still feel very alone. I live with my boyfriend off campus and its hard. I just feel very alone. my parents seem to have forgotten about me, but the already had by the time my senior year had come. my brother goes to tarleton in stephenville near ft worth. my best friend goes to LOCNAME a m in college station. i'm taking 00hrs and my favorite class is swimming. I'm really bored and I want to go shopping after I get done with this writing assignment,. english is my last class today and it ended early at 0000. I'm really bored and only 00 minutes have gone by I'm tired of writing. I hate seeing all the little rich girls with their fancy clothes walking around campus. it pisses me off because I screwed up and moved into a apartment. early this morning I was in the lab signing in to use a mac. the computer told me to go to b0 so I did and when I got to the computer there was stuff on it but the computer screen had my number on it so I know to use it . but the bitch comes up and starts freaking out about it was her computer. people piss me off because my parents taught me respect and politeness and everyone at ut seems to thing that they need to be rude I just don't get it I'm thinking of transferring to LOCNAME a m because I went down there to help move my best friend into her apartment and I had the best time I've ever had. we went to a bar and I drank at the bar and I'm only 00 so we had fun you could never get away with that down here in austin. its almost time for me to stop then I'm going shopping with the little money I have. I can't wait to get off campers because boyfriends name is jimmy and he is going to go to acc in the spring to get a degree in electrical technicians he already is one but he want a degree to  get more money. it almost time to stop its almost time to stop its almost time to stop then go home it's labor day weekend and I'm so glad because were having a party at the lake house and taking the boat out to go skiing,. can't wait. well its time to stop so I'll  
__label__label1 first a bit of background  last Friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice  I guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened I guess I am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now I'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid I wonder why I mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 00 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so  really I just kid of went on with my life so I'm not dwelling on the crash what I am dwelling on is the fact that I was over the crash in a meter of minutes  this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine  I'm not more or less kind I don't enjoy life more  I even had fun that weekend  I don't feel that I am truly any closer to God   I am not praying any more  not that that is how I judge my relationship with God but even how I judge my relationship a no closer  weird I should have done this later on I think better at night but if I wrote what I was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper I would lose these thought so I guess it is better this way I can always rewrite what I type onto paper but then I would feel the urge to revise and I haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet I mean what is what I truly think and feel what is  spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what I can put together over time so I haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what I write neater or type it  I guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as I think why I write on paper what I this but then even I can't read what I write half the time    on a more petty note I am worried about math I just have no idea what to expect but that is something that I can put to the back o my mind   I'm trying not to think of anything school related because I want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok I'm worried about math because I don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests  oh well   
__label__label0 I feel a bit stressed out this week because it seems like my assignments are piling up. Computers are not my specialty so I am glad I made it on this web page, now if I can only figure out how to check my e-mail. I went to a ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME meeting last, which turned out to be pretty fun. I am so excited about the whole sorority experience. I hope I get a bid. This would be such a great experience - to make new friends. At this moment I am trying to get things done because I have a class in an hour and I have to attempt reading the Wall Street Journal before 0:00. I would have gotten my paper yesterday, but I couldn't figure out the lock combination, so I called the ORGNAME ORGNAME and left a message yesterday. She called me this morning and treated me as if I were a child, speaking real slow and in my opinion she was patronizing me which I really hate. I think I am going to be nervous all week wondering if I am going to get into KDPhi. My roommate and I are getting along pretty well so I am pretty happy about that. She is trying out for Spirits and I hope she gets in because she deserves it. I am worried that it will be difficult for her to get in because 000 girls are trying out for 00 positions.   
__label__label0 They are playing the ORGNAME ORGNAME. They're good but I think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. There closing pitcher, something like, LOCNAME is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to PROPNAME PROPNAME of the ORGNAME. I'm really hungry right now. I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in LOCNAME. LOCNAME has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in LOCNAME. I love LOCNAME and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to LOCNAME for my grandmother's 00th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 00 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. 
__label__label1 It's so stupid. All these people think they're such hot shit because they're pretty now or whatever. And it's pathetic how they're still emotionally screwed up because PROPNAME PROPNAME made fun of them in the third grade and they still haven't recovered. Give me a break. It's been 00 years - get over it!!!! And I hate when the audience says -"You must have gotten the wrong PROPNAME, You don't need PROPNAME PROPNAME - You need PROPNAME PROPNAME!" Ha Ha Ha. I feel really bad for lying to PROPNAME last night. I love him so much and I don't know why I always cut corners. Where's the harm in saying yeah PROPNAME 0 pike idiots were here last night and I drank a couple beers. He won't care. It's like I lie more when I'm completely innocent than I do when I'm totally guilty. Not that I'm guilty ever but anyway. It was so stupid that he got mad about PROPNAME being over last night. Oh that guy is hot on tv. Anyway, It's not like I'm all buddy-buddy with her now. We were just reminiscing. Though we had a lot of shitty times together and I essentially hate her psycho guts, we did have a lot of good times together. Halloween was so much fun. I hope this year is just as fun. I hope Matt doesn't come down and be a bum. I hope if he's here in LOCNAME he'll dress up and be stupid with us. I also hope he starts liking my friends more. I love him, but he's got to accept all of me. Damn, nice house. This guy has a really cool pool with a bridge over it. Neat. But - --I forget what I was talking about. He's been so sweet since I left. I never heard him be so goofy over me and writing me letters and saying how much he loves me all of the time. I don't know if it's just because he's so lonely in SFA but I like ie. He makes me feel good when he's all mushy and stuff. I really need to turn off the tv. Everything I think gets clouded up by what's on tv. Oh well because my time is up. 
__label__label0 I can't stand how removed the users are from the control of the system. With internet explorer I can't even get it to work with trumpet Winsock, so if I want to use IE then I have to go down to the computer center and pay them a bunch of money for the ORGNAME connect system when I already have trumpet Winsock that has always worked fine in the past. now with ORGNAME I keep having a completely different problem, there are several times that I go to web pages that I know are there and they aren't for example I tried to go to the pretesting WebPages and I soon as I sent my social security number out over the web, which I'm not especially happy about having to do, it tells me that the document has no data. The same thing has happened before when I try to log on to the ORGNAME house website. I consider myself a pretty smart person, but I cannot figure out at all what the hell is going on with this stupid then. I know I have to go down to campus and use a computer down there for 00 minutes to do the pretesting. and why the hell is it when you connect to UT and go on the web the connecting is so freaking slow. I swear UT must have some really outdated equipment down there because my download speeds never get over 0 K. that's ridiculous. but this is the way at UT. When you go to a school with 00000 students everything takes a little longer and your chances of having to deal with an idiot are raised considerably. I think I have an especially low tolerance for stupid people. Uneducated is different but there seem to be a lot of people out that that are truly student I think, and they frustrate the hell out of me. It's not that I'm a genius of something, but there are some real idiots out there. There is this girl in my engineering economics class that sits up in the front and will ask questions that make no freaking sense at all. How in the hell does someone get to be an upper division engineering major and be so stupid. obviously it happens through, although most of the really stupid people that I have to deal with come from working at ORGNAME. I guess that's my own fault, it's not like I should expect anything else. When I was a ORGNAME we would have some cashiers that I have not idea at all how they got hired. I think personnel hires anyone with a pulse sometimes, I mean if the person sitting across the table from you just has this completely blank look on their face, that's a good sign that you shouldn't hire them. Another thing that bugs me are all the stupid laws regarding alcohol in this country. I mean either it should be legal or it should, but alcohol seems to be the only think that is legal to some of the adults and only part of the time. I mean were are talking about adults, some of them may not be especially bright but they still are adults. if 00 is good enough for every thing else then it should be good enough for alcohol. you can get married, go to jail, go to war, own property, get a gun, hell anything that any other adult does except drink. seems pretty backwards to me. something else that is freaking stupid and at the very least unfair is the way that car insurance companies can completely screw over guys. when a girl turns 00 she gets a good rate, but a guy has to wait until he is 00, hello but most of the really awful drivers that I have ever been around are women, they are  the ones that pay no attention at all to what is going on around them. but since older people control the laws etceteras the younger people are going to continue to get screwed over, I think they should make people over 00 pay the same rates as 00 year olds, that would be funny. oh well out of time, it's been real 
__label__label0 It was very frustrating to get on to the web site. However, the weekends are fun. I get to see my friends that are not at this school. This weekend I went home to see one ORGNAME my friends who signed with the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. One goes to ORGNAME and the other goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME college. He was supposed to go to LOCNAME to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. Now he is writing other colleges and the ORGNAME coach called him. If he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. I also got to see my boyfriend. He goes to ORGNAME. He was my best friend first and now we are together. It is great. However, I miss him a lot. He is the sweetest guy I know. Anyway, right now I am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. It is really a pain. I need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my Ethernet card. It is not compatible with my laptop. I am right now in the school of business. However, I am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. My dad thinks this is a terrible idea. My mom thinks I should do what will make me happy. I guess I need to get as much information as I can about the type of jobs that I can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school I will have to complete. I will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. I really do not want to go here next year. I want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. I will probably stay in the state. I will probably go to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Oh well, I guess I have a while to decide. 
__label__label1 I think that I am a pretty friendly guy who is fun to hang with but no one ever calls me. I don't know if its because I get decent grades and look studious that they figure that I won't want to do anything or if its just because they don't like me and they are just pretending to like me. I used to think that I had good judgement of people but after finding out that all my friends in high school basically used me in class and ignored me outside of class, I have questioned in from then on. My quest to find a good group of reliable friends always seems to come to a dead end. I look at both of my sisters who are always getting calls from their classmates and friends and I never get any. They don't help much either because they are always reminding about the fact that I have no friends. I know people and I say hi to them in the hallways and class and they talk to me normally in class but outside of class I have no touch with them. I admit that I have done the best of job of keeping in touch with anyone, but I've started to this year but with no results so far. I always end up doing the calling and asking what people are up to. No one ever calls me. It just makes me mad. While people are complaining about all the junk mail and excess mail they get, I basically hoping or looking forward to getting one message per day. Lately, I think I'm so obsessed with it that I religiously check my e-mail hoping that something new happened. Other than that everything so far is going well. I've already joined a couple of clubs, got some leadership positions and will be volunteering. My resume is starting to shape up. Now if only my grades would follow, a decent grade on the ORGNAME would give me an excellent chance of getting into a decent medical school. Before none of these things bothered me before, even in high school. Just like in high school I see other people doing things and never cared that I never did. But once I came to college, it just started bothering me. I don't know if its my sister's influence or what its become a problem that last year kept me from doing good in my classes. Whether its same or not this year, I'm not going to let it ruin my grades. I hope to get a 0. 0 from now till I graduate. I tried talking to people, opening up about my problems and things like that because some people told me that I was to closed and that they didn't feel at ease with me because it looked like I was too serious. Everyone that knows me never seems to think that I'm serious. They don't think that I give a care about anybody or anything but myself. I don't mean to come of that way but I'm just good at expressing my emotions. When I do, the response that I've gotten from others is that I'm stupid if I can't even figure it out by myself. I figured maybe I caught them at a wrong time or something and would try again but same thing happens. After a while I feel like I'm starting to bug them and just let it go. I think that I am a good listener but no one ever tells me about their problems. I think they think that they can't trust me or won't be able to help them. I wish they would because I truly do get a rush out of helping people for some reason. I'm not saying it because I'm egotistical or overwhelmed by myself but I really do enjoy helping others. If I didn't become a doctor, I really wouldn't mind becoming a teacher. I don't know if its because I get to showcase what I know and understand or if its because I just enjoy making someone else understand but I just like it. I would hate it if it was an ego thing, because I always tried to fight against the ego thing. Sometimes I can be at certain moments but later after I think about it I usually apologize for my mistakes. Most people get on me about being egotistical but if they ever looked at themselves objectively they would find that they have a greater ego. If I point that out to them they'll just ignore and say that I am wrong and give me longer lecture on me being egotistical or something else. I try to use their own words, conversation, statements examples whatever but they just deny it. I'm not strong willed enough to continue the argument so I usually give up. I lose a lot of arguments. I think that humans generally think that if they win an argument then they must be right and not necessarily because they just talked more than the other person. I find or observe a lot of ironic things about humans and wonder how the things can co-exist. I find them very interesting. Just the possibilities even the slightest that something every is against is actually the right way. When I try to discuss this someone else, they just look at me as if I'm just crazy. I have a lot of curiosity and like to explore but at my own pace and not at societies beckoning. Maybe that's why I have a hard time fitting into society. I haven't found a group of people yet that are categorized as me or have the same ironic interests, at least ironic according to societies view. I'm a mix of several things both culturally and socially. Well that's about 00 minutes now think I'm going to go on to assignment two. 
__label__label0 The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 0 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in LOCNAME. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at LOCNAME it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. 
__label__label1 Everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. Even though I am polite and nice. I consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. So I don't see what the problem is. So far, the first 0 0/0 weeks of school, I have not yet to meet a nice girl. I don't know what's wrong. It is sort of making me depressed. During orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. So far, I still hang around my friends that I had during high school. I want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. I hope the meetings at FSA and ORGNAME will aide me in meeting new people. The parties here are pretty cool though. I just wish they played different music. My neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. The girls on my floor are also hard to approach. I don't know if it's me. Maybe I'm thinking too much. The time I spend here seems to go by so fast. I get homesick quite often. I want to go back to LOCNAME. Maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. I haven't been spending quite as much money as I planned to spend. so far I have spent probably around 00 bucks a week. which is average I guess. My classes so far has been good. I just hate oversleeping. Right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. College is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me. 
__label__label0 I know that I have assignments to take care of but I do not want to complete them. I know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, I still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. But that  is were the apathy sets in again and I will not take action. It seems like a cycle that I know at my house. My dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, I could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. I do not blame  him, I just see a pattern that is similar to mine. But at least I am working now. I still have German 000 to complete that is were I am most suffering. I need to review, and starting to catch up before I wind up failing. It would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. Me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. At some point I have to break this cycle but sometimes I don't think I will. But I must press on. If I don't turn it around, on my own now that I am in college, I am afraid I never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. I have to start putting my foot down. Tonight was a good start. I told my suite mate who I am very good friends with that I could not go see a band play with him. instead I opted to stay home and do work. However, only now I am beginning to work on it. That is very disappointing . It seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. I will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. It will be very nice to get away. The depravity of this city seems to be catching me. Or rather I am slowing down to let it get me. Waco is a much different society than LOCNAME. I cannot be lure d away. Then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. Waco has all the same trappings, I just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . Now I can fall and It doesn't look that I will stop. I cannot think like that. But any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 0 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed I need to work ion to improve myself. I just know that this cannot go on or I will star0 to pay some very hefty consequences. My dad always told me before I left for UT that I would be greatly affected t by the people I surround myself with. I can see how this is partly true but I do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. I will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. I will be in control of what it is I will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. This is the time for me to start caring. I am not sure what else I can talk about. I have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. My mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and I need an escape. Perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. I don't believe that I have  much longer to continue writing on this assignment. Two very large priorities for the even0ihng that I still have to take care of is my German, which I have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow I return to work and I need better clothing than what I am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. It may seem late, but if I am outrunning that new leaf, I am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. My mind is growing blank and I believe that I should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic. 
__label__label1  I feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. I know I'm supposed to write about what I am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. I don't usually tell anyone how I am really feeling ever. I'm worried that I might not be studying as much as I should be. I don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. I mean I know I could read the texts, but I really don't think that would do me any good since I have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. I hate math. I don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. He is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. I don't think I'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. I miss my boyfriend a lot. He is going to school in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I'm not going to see him for at least three more months. I tried living with him in El Paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. I was going to go to school with him, but I decided to move back to LOCNAME because we were starting to hate each other and I missed my family a lot also. It's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. I really don't understand it at all. I wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. I know I need him and he needs me, and I really hate it. I have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but I know the truth even though I would never admit it to even my closet friends. I wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. She was so excited when she got hired. I really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what I am thinking. I mean who really cares anyway?  People are always asking you how you feel, but I'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. I know lots of times I ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. I hate when people look at me in queer ways. I always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. I wish I didn't care, but I do. 
__label__label0 However, after becoming sick I began to notice how much I was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines I needed. Now I have to do it all on my own. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, I had to pick up my medicine, I was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. Now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. I now have to wonder if I am doing things right, or if I am screwing things up. Also, I keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and I am not quite sure if I feel ready to see some of the people I graduated with. I am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but I am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. Then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. Everyone so going to make comments on the fact that I still don't have a boyfriend, or that I am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. All of this seems so superficial when I look at it, but this is the stuff that I have been thinking about. I have met several guys that I am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. I always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. I can pretend that I like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but I can't last more than two weeks with that person. I can try and try to make things work out but I always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. I just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. All through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and I was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture. I am unable to totally figure out what my problem is , but I am hoping now that I am in college I will "find myself. " 
__label__label1 so I'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. I have no real plans for tonight so I decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that I'm going through right now and yes I am going through a lot of personal problems but I don't want to write about those because I've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and I sort of get along but I'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares I went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country I mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about I mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and I'm not having much but that's another story. I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 00 minutes and I'm tired 
__label__label0 it is about 00% hispanic and 0% anglo and 0% other. my house is an hour west of south padre island, where my family owns a condo at suntide I and a sailboat in which we dock it at the sea ranch. I will arrive home aroung four thirty or five to go back to my highschool and surprise my boyfriend PROPNAME. he will be practising basketball when iget there because he doen't expect me home till six. then I will go home and see my mom, sister,and dog cocoa. cocoa is a chocolate lab that has been missing me very much . she gets extreemly excited every time my boyfriend goes over thinking that I should be around there some where. around seven I will leave  to go to about an hour of a football game. see the cheerleading squad that I miss and the band march which I miss just as much. then from there iwill leave and go to the beach, with jason. my mon and sister willalready be there. when I get there my mom promised to bbq my favorite foods, since the dorm food has already gotten old. then at the beach I will spend quality time with my family and take cocoa for walks on the beach, where she loves to run in the ocean and chase sea gulls. I most importantly can't wait to take those long romantic walks on the beach at night with my boyfriend, whom I love and miss very much. on saturdaymy dad and little brother will meet us there after the hunting trip. sunday my  neighbors will come down. they are my family down there because our closest relative is in wisconsin. they will bring all there children, which adds up to seven. my boyfriends parents and little brother will also be meeting us down there as well. I can't wait to spend time with all those people, and  tell them about my new family up here. I just got into a sorority, a week ago tomorrow. alpha delta pi  is the one that I got into, and I love it. they make us study ten hours a week at the house which I think will a positive thing for everyone. however I will miss my roommate this weekend. her name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and is also a engineerig major like myself. I'm going into civil though and she is going into mechanical. but we get along very well. this is her lab top that I', writing  this assignment on right now. she is so sweet. she is even saportive of me being in  a sorority. and we went pot luck.                    
__label__label1 My dad and I are trying to reconnect our computer and get the internet back on it and he is driving me crazy. He insults my intelligence and thinks I never know what I am talking about. This really makes me upset and hurts my feelings to the point I just feel like breaking down into tears. I am also stressed out about school this semester. I am on probation right now because my ORGNAME fell below 0. 0. I am really trying to keep up this semester and bring it up but it is really stressing me out. Sometimes I just feel like giving up on everything but I know that will not solve anything. My life just feels so empty right now. To start off with I get in a bad car accident a few months before I graduate high school and then get a really crappy job for the summer. Then I end up on probation at the end of my first year at LOCNAME and I still have the same crappy job for the summer. Then I also have to take a summer course at ORGNAME along with my crappy job. Then I have to have surgery which put me out of commission for half of the summer. The next thing I know my boyfriend and I are separating after a year and a half. Now I am back at LOCNAME struggling to keep up and improve my grades. My life just seems to be going down the drain right now and I seem to be following close behind. Though I enjoy my classes this semester I feel I am going to fall behind and I will end up need major help to get through it all. I just wish I had enough motivation to follow through with my studies and just blow everyone out of the water with my grades this semester. I wish now that I hadn't put this assignment off so long because now I have to be all the way out here on campus instead of at home studying. You know if I don't get off probation I am afraid my parents or the school will take me out and I will end up at ORGNAME permanently. Getting a degree from ACC is not the best thing in the world you know. It is almost like getting a GED from high school because you had to go to ATLAS or something to that effect. 
__label__label0 I was looking forward to this game all week because last week they beat LOCNAME, the defending national champions. Also it doesn't help that most of my friends are anti-LOCNAME dame so when they lose it makes it even worse. I really  thought that if Notre LOCNAME could beat the national champions, they could beat LOCNAME state who is unranked. Besides that today has been kind of slow because I didn't wake up until about 0, it was a long night. The last couple of weekends have been like this, I stay out until 0 or so and then sleep till 0 or 0 the next day. When you wake up this late it really ruins the entire day because you think that most of the day is gone and you really can't get going. Also the weather has not helped the situation. I think the weather had been me more inclined to stay in my room and just sit around, not that that's really bad, it just kind of makes you feels unproductive. It is kind of nice that it had been cooler the last few days, I have been looking forward to wearing more long sleeve cold weather stuff but since it has been raining, its been kind of pointless. Besides, I have been trying to make it more cold than it really is. last night I planned on wearing a long sleeve sweater sort of thing but when I went outside for a little while I found it really wasn't all that cold, it was just cooler than normal. Right now I am also look forward to the next couple of weeks because I am planning on join the mavericks, the basketball spirit association for the university. This has also made me kind of nervous though because I hear that it is very straining physically. I hear that when you are first pledging, you have to wake up at 0am to work out with the group. This will probably suck because I am out of shape when it comes to running and cardiovascular stuff. They also have to lift weights, but I don't mind that =so much because I do that anyway. I hope that this organization will be worth my time and effort, I f so it will be fun, but I don't want to do it for a while and then quit because I don't like the people. Well the cowboy game is on right now, we are loosing but its ok. All this football stuff is getting me ready to play I'M football, this is my favorite I'M sport. We are getting a few teams together this year, I hope at least one will win there division, I would really like one of those intramural champion shirts but they are hard to get because so many teams play each year. I do think this year that I will be able to win one because I will know all the guys on my team, last year I played on an independent team and none of us knew each other. I really am looking forward to I'M football this year. It is almost time to go eat now and my writing time is about done and I am starting to drift out of the trance I was in when I was writing this a few minutes ago. This is actually a pretty fun exercise, its weird to see how my thought drift from one to the next, I was surprised to see how much I wrote and how fast the time went by. 
__label__label0 I feel nervous inside and butterflies keep flying around my chest. This is probably because I am nervous about what my boyfriend has to tell me. I feel excited as well and it's pretty weird, but for the first time, in a long time, I know what it means to take advantage of ones individual strength. I mean I feel as though things will work out, but what if he tells me that the one and a half years we've spent together are over. Anyway, this has pretty much been on my mind since 0:00a. M. I can't really think of anything else but that. Gosh, I am so nervous, but then again I'm probably over reacting. Other things has also been on my mind like my first test in biology. I really don't know what kind of questions are going to be asked. I'm sorry, but I just feel so nervous and I think these butterflies have turned into bats or something because I can't even breathe without feeling more nervous by the minute. I feel pretty confident and I guess that's good. I guess I'll stop thinking about that for awhile and let my heart catch up to my chest pounding. On to another thing I was thinking about. I can't believe that PROPNAME guy from the ORGNAME almost beat the record foe the most homeruns. Pretty weird that I jumped from one serious subject to another, huh?  That's pretty much the way I work inside. I get all worked up about something and then the next minute I'm laughing and having a good time. I know why that happens. I don't look at the bad things in life, I only look at the good things. It's bad for me to say, but I could probably walk down a dark street with no common sense and think that that street is the most safest place on the face of this earth. A lot of people judge a lot of things from the outside which is so unfair to everyone. Not everything that looks ugly or dirty is bad. In fact, the prettiest looking and the wealthiest looking people probably do more crime or illegal things what the "middle or lower" class would do. That's why I hate when I get my pay check and see how much taxes I pay for people to just claim welfare for something stupid. More than half of the on welfare are able to work, they're just too lazy!  I know this for a fact because my boyfriend's step-sister does that. So, basically, while I'm working my ass off for people like her, my money is lost and I don't even get that much taken out of my check for MY Medicare. That's what's so unfair!! Well my 00minutes have flown by so, I will write to you soon for assignment #0. good-bye and take care. 
__label__label0 I usually don't let too many things get to me because I just want to enjoy life. I think that there are a lot of interesting and wonderful things that each person is offered in their life time and I think that it is a shame if people don't take advantage of the things that they are given. At this moment, I am happy and cheerful and I don't have anything that is bothering me. It rained today and I didn't like it, but I wasn't too upset about it because I figured that we could use the rain. It also felt cool outside so the rain really didn't bother me too much. I also have a lot of homework that I need to get done, but I think that I have handled the stress very well. Even though I have many different things to do, I have tried to pace myself and organize myself as to where I have less tension in my life. I try to organize myself based on what I think is convenient and this helps me be a more efficient person, and thus causes me to stay in a pretty good mood. During the past three weeks I have often thought about the new life that I live here at LOCNAME. It is completely different from high school, and even though it has taken a lot of adjustment on my part, I am beginning to see the benefits of college and I am beginning to enjoy myself a little more. At first I was really scared about attending college. I don't think it was anything specific about college, just the whole concept of moving away from home and being without the people that I love most in my life. But, since the beginning of school, I have been able to cope with this type of anxiety a little better and I feel that even though I have left home, I have a chance to start a whole new life here at LOCNAME. I will always be able to see the people that I love and I have accepted the fact that I will be able to see them whenever I want, and this has helped me in enjoying the college life better. There aren't very many different feelings that I usually feel in a day. For the most part, I am usually in a pretty good mood and I see myself as a fun person to be around. I try not to let the little things bother me, because I see so many people who let the small things in life ruin their entire day. My philosophy is why let one bad thing ruin all the good things that you have in life. This is why I usually try not to let too many things bother me or stress me out, it just takes all the fun out of life. I think that happiness is also a choice, people who are happy choose to be happy. They don't let too many things interfere in their lives and this helps them be happy with themselves, happy with those who are around them, and happy with the lives that they live. I choose to be happy everyday, and one of my short-term goals for each day is to end the day on a happy note. I think that it is important to end each day in a happy state of mind, otherwise your gloomy mood just carries over to the next day. When I have to evaluate my feelings, I would like to think that I am in a good mood most of the time and that people are happy to be around me. I enjoy making people's lives a little bit more fun for them. Being happy is a very important aspect of my life and I think that happiness will help me achieve my goals and it will help me lead a happy and prosperous life. I hope to be happy with myself and have others around me be happy with me as well. I think that happiness brings success in your life. I think that if one is happy, then he is successful as well. 
__label__label1 Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group ORGNAME people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside ORGNAME my world at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards PROPNAME, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of LOCNAME. Coming from LOCNAME, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?  It's not that I'm depressed or willing to let go of PROPNAME to free myself of these "troubles," it's just that I want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just "click together. "  Too optimistic, I know. That'slife, I know, but I can still wish that things could be different. I never tyhought I'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. In a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. I guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. But, I've still got troubles. God, I sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually having a pretty good time. I have made friends, and I relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. I truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. Damn, I've got to wake up early tomorrow. I wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life!  My twenty minutes is almost up, and I really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.  
__label__label1 I am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. I don't know if I made the right decisin in coming here, I guess that's because people keep on asking me where I an from and when I say LOCNAME they all ask me why I transfered and why I came here, as if LOCNAME is so amazing and this place sucks. I guess LOCNAME is pretty amazing in some ways. But it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. Added to that I don't like knowing everyone, well I like knowing people but I don't like it when you have no aninimity. I also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, I guess that goes without saying. I feel like I have to step up my game and almost go out "hunting" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. It's not terrible romantic, but I'm getting pretty desperate. There are some hot hot girls here. I don't know what's my problem, It's probably because I live in LOCNAME which is on the other end of the earth. That's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. Although it is a lot easier when your living with them. It's not so bad I've meet some women here, but the one that I am more serious with, I don't find myself attracted to at all. She's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but I really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. It's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. But I really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from LOCNAME. No I really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. I need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem. But I really want to go out with PROPNAME, she is a goddess on earth, she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous. I can't belive it, and I act like such a dork around her but she doesn't seem to mind, and that's what I loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot, I must do eveything in my power to win her I must put the wheels in motion before she gets snatched up, because I know that if I don't act soon and I mean like in the next five minutes, some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what I see and I cannnot let that happen not this time, I've let that happen too many times in the past I've let every girl that I've ever had feelings for get away. And PROPNAME may be the one, she's in the fricking Pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that I am, but if I were with her I would not let that happen. I would do everything for her, I would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her. I have my mission, I must develop my plan, and somewhere in between I must get some studying done. Straight A's and PROPNAME that will be the story of my life for this year. 
__label__label1 I am glad that I am finally getting to this assignment!  I have had so much homework, and just can't seem to stay on top of things. "I'll have the weekend," I continue to say to myself, but I know I'll just want to watch television or hang out instead. I went to the meeting of the tennis club today, and am very excited about that, even if I have to ride the bus to the courts whenever I want to play. I went running this morning, but just feel so out of shape. I know I'll never be super skinny, my body just isn't built like that!  I'm looking forward to playing again. I'm even willing to brave the tournaments, or at least look cool wearing a new t-shirt showing off my participation. I'm sill hoping to meet some people who I can actually hang out with, go out with, stuff like that. I meet many people, but none of them seem to be willing to get to know the real you. They all have friends here from school, yeah, like anyone else from LOCNAME is crazy enough to come here. I also want to play the piano some while I am here. I don't have my books, so I'll have to recover them when I go home in October. I am excited about that, it will be so neat to "fly home" for the weekend!  Hopefully I'll make it up to LOCNAME and LOCNAME to see some people. I've been thinking a lot about PROPNAME lately, and would love to be able to connect with her through seeing PROPNAME'ja and preserving her memory. Too bad he is never home when I call. While I am doing this, I realize I need to do the pre-test, I just can't seem to find an hour!  The weeks are already flying by, and the panic of upcoming tests is setting in. "Oh no, only a week and a half until the first Psych test!"  I'm caught up in reading, re-typing notes, now all I need to do is read them over. I'm so tired right now, all that is left on the agenda for tonight is German, and reading Chapter 0 of Astronomy. It will be nice to actually do problems for once, instead of living my life reading and taking notes. I can't wait until I am confindent in my self-image, if that ever occurs. I just don't have the will power to work out like a crazy woman!  Tennis. just keep thinking. tennis. I really do love tennis, and its number one male star PROPNAME PROPNAME. Too bad he is injured, the US Open just isn't the same!  Maybe my new tennis partners will become my new buddies!  Speaking of tennis, another thing to add to my list is to check on Match Mates. Wow, twenty minutes can be a long time when the assignment is to ramble on about yourself. PROPNAME has to go to the mall this weekend, so I'm going to go with her. RUE 00 and Forever 00, I need to buy myself a new outfit. It will be quite the experience catching the bus to get there though. Just like making it to the tennis courts, I'm a pro at the campus look today. I hope the woman who feel outside Jester is ok, that would be so scary!  I need to go to bed, and tomorrow is my super long day. The SI sessions are going to be a big help, but they are just such a pain to attend. An extra three hours a day is enough to make me crazy. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME meets tomorrow, so that will be fun. Also, Party on the Plaza is tomorrow night, a fun function. I hope I didn't miss Austin Powers playing on the south mall. I didn't get very much e-mail today, that makes for a depressing day. I did, however, get my high school yearbook. I loved how I pimped that school, I miss the friendships. I miss tennis season. Most college students say they don't want to go back to high school, but at this point I wouldn't mind. I'd have to say I loved not doing homework. Ooh, our sing just sounded like it was about to die. I love the internet, it is so convienient typing this paper to submit via the information super highway!  I am completely addicted to my computer, and I'd die without it. I type everything, e-mail everyone, it is truly my life! Well, my 00 minutes are up.

__label__label1 so, what am I suppose to write about? I guess just anything huh. well , there are too much things for me to do this week, so many things. I have voluntary works to do, lots of school works are due by the end of the week, still lots of meetings for organizations and clubs. Also I have to work too. that takes up a lot of time, it seems like everytime there's a meeting they are all bunched together on Tue and Weds, which I can never attend because of work. Sometimes I really wonder if work is really that important that I have to make it all the time, it seems like no one really cares if you do show up or not, you just clock in and find something to do. I don't even have a real job to do yet, I've been doing a lot of different stuff, just wherever they need me. I don't even think the people there knows me at all. I'm pretty new so I guess after a while they will know me. I thought about just skipping work a couple times , but I think I better not. but after I show up to work , there's really nothing to do. they could handle the stuff without me, so then I feel like I should have just skipped work. I forot what time I started writing, I wonder how do they know how long I've been writing. oh , I just got something cool from my ra, and a call for me to go shopping and meet people, cool, so I guess I have to go even though I haven't been writing for twenty minutes, but this thing is pretty long already so I guess it won't matter that much. well, the more I look at it , it seems kinda short! well but I really have to go, what should I do??? YIkes, well I wonder if I can come back later and continue to write , but I don't think that's possible because that just voids the purpose of stream of con. for 00 minutes huh. but I really have to go. so I guess I'll cheat this time. but I'll write longer on the next assignment to make it up I guess. 
__label__label0 I am so tired. I cannot wait to go home tomorrow and sleep in my own bed. I really didn't think I would miss home that much, but apparently I do. Seriously, I cannot wait to go in the car and drive back to LOCNAME. But it's not like I am homesick. Well, actually I guess I am homesick, but it's not for my family. To be quite honest, everytime I talk to my mother, she annoys me. But what I do miss is my bed. Not the house, because we don't' live in the house anymore. NO, we have to move two months before I leave for college. What were my parents thinking???  Obviously they weren't. But I do miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really want to go back to MY room. But, now I have no room. Honestly, I do not consider my dorm room MY room. Thinking of, I definitely need to bring back some more stuff. Pictures and frames - stuff like that. My room mate brought so much crap. It makes my side of the room look so bare. But at the same time, I DID bring a lot of stuff. Anyways, this weekend. My date with PROPNAME. I really don't want to go at all. I know that I completley led him on. I mean I could have told him that I was joking, but I didn't. I basically told him that I liked him. BUT PROPNAME PROPNAME! - UGH!  I still sound like I am totally in highschool. I know that in college you are supposed to throw away all your passt conceptions of people, but how can I do that about the guy who teased me for like 0 years. How many times can you say, "But Mr. PROPNAME, I'm only eleven?"  and think it to be funny. I swear in seventh grade I could have shot him and PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME is another boy, who I would never ever date. When he got to be such a heart throb in high school is beyond me. But then again, I never ever thought that I would have a crush on PROPNAME. I am such a hypocrit. The amount of time I was telling PROPNAME, not to like him and not to go for him. But then again, PROPNAME and PROPNAME would not have lasted anyways. Gio is so prude, PROPNAME would have either dumbed her or cheated on her pretty quickly. Gosh, I really hope that this assginment is completion, or else you will think that I am a really shallow and superficial person. Not to meniton judgemental. But actually what can you expect coming from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME - thrid snobbiest school in the nation???  I seriously had fun at high school, but it definitley was a different type of fun than the type of fun I'm having now. I mean in high school I hardly ever drank really, until my senior year. But even then it wasn't EVERY weekend like I do now. I mean, we used to do stupid stuff like go to the airport and play airport tag, wrap or in the case of PROPNAME "condimenting" houses. But now, it's frat parties every weekend. Not that I am complaining, because I am hanging out with PROPNAME - what a hottie. But he is so rude. and PROPNAME - honestly, I havent' talked to her since 0th grade. It is so wierd how people who were so close are now so far appart. But anyways, maybe the frat parties and the drinking is what is making me so tired, because I am pretty sure that I had less sleep that I am having now in highschool. Is this even stream of consciousness??? I ended up talkign about the same thing I began with, but I guess it is because I did go off on several tangents. But oh well - time's up! 
__label__label1 Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 0. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either. 
__label__label1 Well I have to say I'm alittle nervous about this assignment. Writing for twenty minutes continously will be a challenge sine I don't think I can even sit in the say seat for twenty min. but anyways. PROPNAME I hope this is sufficient, and I'm sorry that you have to look over all of these. THat's quite a task. I'm in the computer lab and there is a guy using a typewriter . I think that's kind of odd. but whatever. THen there is a girl next to me who could probably type 0000 words a minute and I'm over here using my index fingers. Anyway I don't really know where to begin Maybe I'll talk about the use this exersze would be to a psychologist. I bet you can tell a lot form one of these. People are probably honest and least once they get going. And honesty is hard to find these days. We are all actors on the stage of life. "  I take this to mean, to our outside world we put on plays. We are afraid of truely being ourselves {whatever that means} and we end up conforming into a type of behavior that is acceptable to our society. I know If everyone followed this belief, then we would all be the same. But good thing about it, is we all have different wviews of what society is,  And we have diiferent feelings toward that society. Such as rebellion, isolation, acceptance, contentiveness, that's not a word is it. but you know what I mean. I do know this isn't crazy the way things work, how well basically the same but we can be so different. It's very humbling to me. To be just another face in the crowd but there is so much there twhen you look at it. Sometimes I like to look at life{my reality} as a fractal. If you don't know a fractal is geometric chaos. It has an infinite amount of surface area, so If you look at one point, it turns into another point, and so on and so on. THat's what I think the human brain is like. You have human race as a species, then country, then state, then county, then town, then extended family, then nuclear family, then the mind itself, and in comparison to the rest of theat one hasn;t gone anywhere. THere is so much learn.  
__label__label1 I am just sitting here watching ORGNAME with my roommate. They're talking about PROPNAME PROPNAME' ankle injury the other day. Go PROPNAME! I really don't have many emotions right now, I'm pretty tired. I've been at a horse show all weekend. My girlfriend competes in them, and I go for moral support and to help out. Shes coming over later today to go to lunch with me. Now theyre showing some really amazing plays on sports center. woah! I'm really enjoying psychology, a lot more than I thought I would. Its really fascinating, especially with my professor. My major right now is architectural engineering, but I'm thinking of changing later to maybe mechanical or architecture, I don't know. this stream of conciousness thing is pretty hard. will I get information later and be able to analyze myself or is someone going to read this and say "man what a dumbass" or what? I'm kind of curious about that survey, too. I understand the fear questions, but what the hell was that one page about sex all about? Kinda personal, don't you think? Oh well, I answered truthfully. Why does this thing have to last for 00 minutes? this is hard. I enjoyed the lecture about the lie detecting. I didnt guess the right number, but I could tell when he lied. oh well, I'm done 
__label__label0 It's Sunday and I need to go to church since I didn't go this morning because I woke up at 00:00 and church is at 00:00. So I already took a shower and I'm dressed to go at 0:00 p. m. Right now it's 0:00 and I wish it was about 0 because it seems like the day has just went by and I haven't done very much. That's alright though because I'm listening to my favorite rap music. Trick Daddy Dollars, Ja Rule, ORGNAME, Ice Cube, Hot Boys, Juvenile, Black & Dangerous, LOCNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, ORGNAME, and JT Money they seem to make me feel better. Even if I'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. Earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. She got mad because I was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where I was at. So I had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. I was mad also because I gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. So we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that I didn't approve of. So I was instantly angered because I have a short temper to begin with. It was a big deal really but I don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. So we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. She decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. I acted like I didn't care so we just ended it there. This worries me because I hate to end it like that but I'm so hardheaded that I won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. It also hard because I'm here and she's 000 miles away and I can't see her the way I use to. I guess I'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what I'm use to. The girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people I've never seen so many people in one place at one time. Being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that I'm not used to. Hopefully I'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. I don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. Whatever happens I'll just try to do my best and do the best I can as things come along.

__label__label1 Wow, here is Friday night and I'm doing my psychology assignment that was supposed to be due yesterday. I remember setting all of ORGNAMEse personal goals for my four glorious years at college, and here I am in week three coming to the not so surprising realization that these goals were totally unrealistic to begin with. Why do people even set goals?  Goals lead to expectations, expectations lead to disappointments. PROPNAME, one of my personal inspirations founded the great religion of Buddhism. He came up with the not so clever theory that those who desire nothing are never disappointed with life. I think most of us had that one figured out in Kindergarten or perhaps I was just exceptionally bright. As humans we set goals because we find ourselves having nothing to do, and because we fail to accept the fact that we have absolutely no control over our future, which makes man totally uncomfortable. Our technological advancements were not necessarily for the good of humanity but instead to compensate for our innate fear of nature. It's ironic because most Americans have adopted the religion of Christianity, and according to Christianity God created earth and all of its creatures, yet we put absolutely no faith in nature and certainly not in mankind. We're supposed to believe in that which we can not see and yet we can't even trust what it is we do see. Man is full of hypocrisy in every aspect of life. Some are better than others but in the end we're all hippocrites. More specifically, Christians in general are very interesting group to observe. Every Sunday people enter a building to worhip and praise God. They may sit in a pew for an hour but does this hour really change anyone's life?  Most people struggle simply to stay awake, to walk away getting something out of the sermon is just too much to ask. Sadly enough most people think that because their religion is the "chosen" one that this hour makes them better than those who choose to sit at home and watch ORGNAME the ORGNAME. As much fun as this tangent I've been getting on really has been my twenty minutes are more than up. So we'll just continue this . what is this they say. next session. 
__label__label0 PROPNAME happened today. i can't believe PROPNAME killed himself I'm fine but what about PROPNAME and PROPNAME What was going on in his head. I hope PROPNAME and PROPNAME can deal. Horriblr thing to happen. I hope PROPNAME stays in school. I worry about everyone too much Not enough about me. I'm glad I can be the strong one and be there for them. i wish we were all back at home. Right now home feels so far I would love to hug my mom. she is worried about me. her baby away at school. what am I doing at this school. i feel so lost. Is this where I meant to be  Ineed a reason to be here. I'm not supposed to be lonely. Will I ever fall in love I hate being in this room alone. I need someone here with me. why is life so confusing? What do my feelings mean everyone has it so together. Will I? I put too much meaning in everything. Poor Max What a wasted life. He needed someone to help him. I want to be there for matt but he needs time to grieve. I can't be intrusive. I need to stop trying to fix everthing. Its all planned out already. I hope I see PROPNAME tomorrow. He gives me something to look forward to. Hes such a nice guy. Is he interested in me? Tomorrow is a new day. Today has opened my eyes. Don't take life for granted. 
__label__label1 Free asscia-association. My friend and I have a game that we play on instant messenger with free association. it's fun. My nose is cold, this dorm is always cold except for that one time- where it was hot after I had walked in from already being hot in this hellish austin climate. I'm listening to john coltrane. my friend bought me this cd. it's really hard to not press backspace when I misspell a word. um. i like the music I'm listening to but it's kind of a bad recording. a girl down the haa, syd and I were taling about britney spears the pop singer tonight. I was concerned about how she's making pre-teen girls want to change thiere bodies since she got a boob job and since seh she's an pop idol- it's okay to get one or something. I was never happy with my size when I was little, but I just don't think that she should have gotten one. it's not that important. um,. 00 minutes>? I have all of 00 more to go. I'll stop at 0:00. I went to my first frat party last night. that was a trip and a half. there were several people from my high school and one girl from my ex-boy's college(baylor) and I don't like her much, becuase I don't know what kind of relationship they had. that boy. jesus christ. that bastard. well, it's okay I talktd to him f on the phone for a while today for the rfirst time in -well, since I got here. we erewere really close over the summer. he was smoking pot when I called. I called becuase last night after the party I came home an dwhen I checked my email, I recieved amn emial fronmm some guy named richard _will I print this out?- he has a n address similar rto my ex's an di've been sending emial to the wrong guy. so I emailed him back event though I didn't knowhim and explained to him what had happened. then I got a respncse today from him and I mailed m him again. I relly like my computer. I t upset someone , thoiugh. , I went out with a guy that I met becuase he built my computer, he told me I that he loved me after 0 weel and I (week) got scared. I hate most men now. but that's okay. hating boys is what made the frat party so fun last night. I danced with a boy for about a minute and then dropped him - just like that and walked back to my grlfriends, laughing. ewe walked home last night- right past some cops-we also made friends with the bouncer. he told us a joke to see if we;d been dringing. I thought he was great. well, I son't know what else to say. my fingers are cold my nose itches and my hair is in my face. syd said that someone's talking about you when your nose itches. I always though taht when your necklace was on wrong someone was thinkg og of yu. I have a stuffed animalk. she's the super adventure team mascot. esta eric and adnrew and me. we had so much fun. ruby was the mascot. jojos, photograh, high speed, gun. I meanyt fun, but it came out gun, I haven't been looking at the screen becuase I am not very good at typing like that. I'm starting at my fingers and io know when I mess up, still, but I'm not fixing it. I was a little at the beginning out of habit- ani di franco has a sog called out of habit. "you know, art is why I get up in the morning, but my defif\nition ends there, it soesn't seem fair that I;'m living for something I can't even tdefine,. and there you are right there in the mean time, wekll I don't want to play for you anymore. Show me what you can do. Tell me what are you here fo. I wasnt my own time I wasm my old friens, I want my f\old face, I wasnt my own mind. Fuck this time and place. I like that sone. it's a favorite, I only have 0 minutes left. I wanted to do this when I had full concentration adn preferably not a roommate bugging me. she went home for the weekwnd. she wasnted me to go with her. she talks in her slepep, and it 's really funny, but I try not to laugh becuase I'll wake her up. I'm worried about my friend breda, I miss her. I worry about PROPNAME and Esta too. I love thenm. I have on e more minute. Maybe I'll have a tic tac when this is all over. I need to go to the ORGNAME tomorrow for art history I need to sugn up for experinments, too. I'm not going to sign that health form, though. I don't know if I want to give access to my health records like that. I have nothing to hide, I'm just not comfortable with it. I have cramps now. an dmy time is up, so bye. 
__label__label1 feeling free right now. door underneath punded. resonated and left me shaking. there is music next to me and it has a beat. the bass bothers me sometimes. like when I was riding in the car with my brother when we went to the zoo that one time. he used to always pick on me but now he is not here. its not the first time that I hav enot seen him for awhile. but I see casey everyday. I like being here at ut. this apartment is great. just leaning against the bunkbed while typing feels great. I feel at home most of the time, except for tommy when he makes his comments. I keep expecting to have to go home and climb in my own bed but every time that I walk back to my dorm from here I realize that I am going to my new home , the dorm. My roommate is nice, she studies all the time. I feel that I don't study enough when I am with her. She is going to major in math just like I am. but I don't know what I want to do or if I really want math. this song is great. it makes me happy and hyper. but I am still upset that I don't know what I want to do. Everyone here does. they all have their special thing and I am just feeling the way along. that is more comfortable. the keyboard is on my lap and now my hands or wrists rather don't hurt as much. I like psychology. I am excited about the experiments. from what dougs mom was talking about them earlier they sound like a lot of fun. But I don't know if I will be able to just go up and talk to people like that. I am glad that I will have casey in my class this year. He is so smart and wonderful and I love him. I am really glad that we are engaged. he is the best thing that has happened to me since I moved to texas. LOCNAME was not good at all but I have to stick up for it when doug and casey pick on me and tell me that I say things weirdly. This is a beautiful song. I really like it. But one bad thing about it is that I remember being with ryan when I listen to it. Riding around in caseys car when we were first going out. We listened to her then too and I made him sing to aida. He has a beautiful voicce and I love to listen to him sing. I love the way her voice sounds and the different inflections in all the right places. My foot itches and now that I scratched it, everything else is itching too. Sometimes they talk too much about computers and that junk. But that is their thing and it makes them happy. I just have to find what makes me happy. Skiing. I want to go skiing,  It is so hot here. skiing would be great and romantic. last year was the first time that I ever skiied and it was great. I did a lot of things with church that I had never done before but I think that all of these things were because I got together with casey. like this barbie girl song. I hated it but then he would always play aqua and I got to liking all of the songs and liking him more and loving him and falling for him and casey is wonderful. aqua/  like an ocean or island. so peaceful and wonderful. I like heroes the game with amanda, It reminds me of lord of the rings. My hair tickles my face. my ear itches. doug has a cute voice. he is trying to sing. idont hate casey's cat. it is really cute. I just wanted to get him something better and I wish I could have found a cuter one so I have to put it down because I don't know why. it does not really matter. I overreact too much and am selfish and whine. this is kind of fun actually. I want to take a photography class next semester. My mom says that I am good at it. I jsut want to find something that I am good at. Make everyone proud. But I put too much pressure on myself. I think that is why I am nervous this week because I want to adjust and I don't know if I am going to do well in my classes and I hope I do but am scared. My wrist hurts like when I am playing minesweeper. an addicting game. somethign I am good at, unlike half life which I am getting better at. My ear itches. I need to go to the store and get some cables, I hope to find them and understand how it works. physics scares me and I am not good at it. why am I majoring in math and how did sarah make up her mind in one weekend about college. I think those are the same reasons. Time's up. 
__label__label1 I have no idea where to start on this thing, and I forgot to look at the clock 0:00, okay, I feel better now. This has got to be the longest version of LOCNAME LOCNAME ever, it takes them about 0 years to start singing. I need to go to the grocery store, need to get some milk and hot dogs. the essentials. Could probably just run to the 0-00, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion. Should just by a new one, but don't know where I'd put this one in this tiny room. Dorms suck. Living it up at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man, my typing skills have gone downhill, it's sad. I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 00 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 00. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised PROPNAME hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love PROPNAME PROPNAME. this song brings back memories of 0th, no 0th grade. I think I liked 0th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s. I should really go find PROPNAME and reminesce. Don't think that's spelled right, whatever. Haven't talk to PROPNAME in awhile, she's probably off trying to be the next PROPNAME foster. psycho. Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy. PROPNAME will probably be back in my spot. That would suck. My foot's asleep, three minutes to go. The computer better not crash now. I really should clean this room up, that's probably on the list of things to do. I wonder what song is next. Oh, that's the end, good my time is up. 0:00, yeah. 
__label__label0 Ever since I came to LOCNAME about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in LOCNAME. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. 
__label__label1 Coming to ORGNAME has to be one of the best choices I have made. Living in dobie has to be one of the worst. I wish I would have stayed at one of the honors dorms because the people seem so much more sociable. It seems that this place is extremely cliquish and such. My roommate is cool, although he seems to already have a group of friends here and isn't at all interested in making new ones. I'm a very social person. I have to be in contact with people all of the time or I get severely lonely. I don't like to feel cut off. I wouldn't even stay at my dorm the first night because I didn't have the internet or my cable connected. It is odd how we feel like television, internet, and phones make us feel so connected. I would die now without the internet. I love being able to chat with all of my friends about how they are doing in college. It is so odd being here at LOCNAME with so many students from big schools. I'm from such a small school I feel like I don't fit in or I don't know enough. It is odd how being from a small school can make you feel so inadequate at times. I feel like the others have some greater advantage than me. Being at such a big university is such a big advantage. That is why I chose to come here. I really love how much a university this size has to offer. I mean look how awesome the stadium is and the the academic programs. The theater is wonderful and who can top gregory gym?  It is so awesome to be surrounded by so much, but it is also so odd to feel so lonely sometimes. There is so much to do, but not always someone to do it with. I have one friend here with me from school. She is so much more than a friend. She means everything to me but she has hurt me so badly. I don't know if it is possible to overlook what she did to me last october. I can't tell if I could possible love her more than anyone else I'll even incounter, but it really seems possible. How else could you forgive someone so easily for hurting you so bad. She wants to be everything to me and all she wants is for me to say the same. But it is hard to base my life around someone that has thrown my life off balance once. She is such a good person and all she needs is someone to really love her and I really do love her a lot. I hope I can put the past behind us. We are so perfect ogether. We love similar things, yet we are really different. She loves art, I love art. She loves music, I love music. We are passionate about many of the same things. The sexual relationship is so nice too. I like feeling so hot and passionate. Sex is kinda a thing in a relationship that is sybolic of acceptence to me. I mean when I bare myself to someone else it makes me feel good. I feel like we are really together. I've never even been with another girl. I feel like I am so unexperienced but it doesn't matter I guess. If you find someone you are willing to stay with why does it matter how many people you have sex with. I guess it is just society that tells us that we should have many sexual partners before marriage. That is so different from what the church teaches. I really don't agree with much of what the church say about sexual represion and not going with basic instincts or enjoying ones self. I kinda am a member of my own sect of religion. I think that there has to be some supreme authority but how am I supposed to believe that man can concieve this preterhuman figure. It doesn't seem like man should be able to explain the creator and so why try. I think that mans purpose it to better himself and the generation following him. 
__label__label0 The computer that I am on is not very good, so oi hope that it doesn't kick me off, because it would really suck to have to do this all over again. I don't reallly understand how writing my miscellaneous thoughts will help me to learn about psychology. I do see how it can help others study my psychology, but what do my thoughts have to do with a class on introdutory psychology. This last few days I have really missed my girlfriend, seeing as how she is still at home, finishing her senior year. But thankfully I get to go home in 0 days and will hopefully get to see her for an entire saturday. I love her more and more every day which leads me to the conclusion that absence does make the heart grow fonder! I got a job as a houskeeper in the union on the weekends from three to midnight. The sorry thing is that I won't get to see any football games and also my dad is coming to visit me this weeekend, and won't get to see me untill monday because of my job. the good thing about my job is that I really won't have a chance to party. I have been sober for a year now and would lie to keep it that way, and my job will hopefully keep me away fromthe parties. I have given up drugs, cigarettes, and alchohol which leaves me with only reforming my dirty mouth. The way in which I plan to do this is by wearing a rubber band around my wrist and popping myself everytime I cuss. I also let the people around me know about this so that they can inform me of the times that I cass without my knowing it. College life has been pretty good to me so far, but my cousin is not responding nearly as well as I am. I have heard that she calls hrying everynight to her house. But I think that it is because of the fact that her parents, particularly her mother have done everything for her and always spoken for her the entirety of her life. Now that she is own her own, she doesn's know what to do with herself. I feel sorry for her sometimes, bt other times I think that it is about time she learned what life outside her family is like. I do hope that things get bette for her. and that things stay good for me 
__label__label0 Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 0. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to ORGNAME ORGNAME too. Which makes things even more confusing. One, if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing?(It's only an hour and 00 minutes away, but still that's different than living in the same town 0 minutes away) Also what goes on in my head is would I really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would I really want to put up with whole long distance thing. I can't stop thinking about him and I think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too. He is actually 0 years older than me, so I know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college. I don't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways I am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head. I just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that I do, but who knows I guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and I are going to work out, so I should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much. I guess I can only prepare myself the best I can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy I guess is ment to be. 
__label__label1 I guess right now I would be feeling on edge, or wary. It is on rare occassion that I have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. I worry about everything, though. I worry about this class. What will the tests be like? Am I studying enough? How many times should I review the material? I know that it is better to "overlearn" something, but in doing so, I think I will go crazy. I try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top  of the previously assigned work. I cannot convert into a complete "bookworm" because I would not be at ease with myself. I need time to relax and just chill with my friends. It is almost a set system that I have with myself that I read as much as I can, and then I go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. It's kind of ironic that the thing I reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, I have a killer soar throat. from what, I have no idea. It's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. I'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because I hate being sick. I love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. Yes, I am aware of DAYquill, but it has such a bad taste. Gross. it does work, though. hopefully what I have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever I had the other day. I was burning up. The only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. I took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the ORGNAME called to invite me out to eat. I really wanted to go, but I couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that I couldn't go because I want to be able to be as involved as I can in any organization that I join. I felt as though I had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. Thursday, I will hosting for apple computer at the ORGNAME company night. I think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but I need to do some "boning" up on the apple company before I speak with any of the recruiters. of course, I will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when I have four classes, and which is also the day that I promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night I was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. From everything I have mentioned, I have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that I am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if I really could have done something or not, or even where I stand in life. weeks before I came to ut, it seemed like I had a firm grip on life. I had a group of friends that I partied with all the time, and while I knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while I still have my ties, I now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, "What am I doing with  myself?" I know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because I am  "building" myself, but I don't think I can completely be myself yet, because I don't know "completely" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, "Be yourself. " I'd say that half of the people at this school don't know who that is. in any case, I need to go smoke. 
__label__label1 okay, well to start off, I'm really not sure or confident of how my experience here at LOCNAME will effect me. "will I succeed, or fail, only time will tell", I really have a hard schedule for my first semester, a lot of memorizing, which I can do, but just don't want to put that much effort. Sound like I'm a no brainer, but if I have to do it "ill do it", that doesn't mean I want to. my goal is to have a midrange of a 0. 0 to 0. 0 avg. but right now I'm right this short writing assignment for Psy. and I reallly just can't seem to expand my thoughts on the consccious, I guess it's because the prompt says, think spontaneously, but how the hell do I do that if I'm under pressure. excuse my language. but just thinking spontaneously. well I really like this prompt, because there is no right or wrong answers and its just basically a written expression of how one's mind works. I'm not trying to kiss up or anythin, but really I do enjoy this. I would have hoped though, that the class would be a little smaller, so I could ask questions freely and not feel bothered, but that's no excuse I guess, what kind of reputation will I have amongst 00,000 people. Well my goal, is to continue doing well academically and also create a good social life. becoz I can't just study and have no fun, that's not in my domain. I've never had stress before, but I might break that barrier this semester. first day of class was pretty cool, because the professor , mr. peddebaker was pretty funny, and I hope I spelled his name right. anyway its a nice experience. I wonder how long it will take me to study for biology, thats probably my toughest class, coz I don't really enjoy it. I loved it at first, but then I took ORGNAME ORGNAME in high school, and my teacher made it so much work, and I didn't reallly get to enjoy it. it was not a fun learning experience. well it's been ten minutes, and ten more to go I'm really counting down dnow. I just say that click once to submit button ( click just onece on submit when you are done)  right now I'm watching this girl, while I type, write the longest email I've ever seen, and on lmy left that girl's writing one too,  god, don't they have somethin better to do? wrong statement, I was judging them, the truth is I probably write more emails then them. that 's because I lived in three different places less than thrree years. Los angeles for 00 and dallas for 0, and austin for one month. I'm movin like a train. but. well I forgot what I was going to write, ooopos oh well, I just got off my spanish class, and that profesor was pretty cool, although I understood his spanish better than his english. but it was still enjoyable. I want to join a fraternity, but I'm afraid I wont have time to do my schoolwork. but I still want to be social and everything like that, I guess is just another decision to think upon. oh my god, this girl stopped writing her email! the lab must be closing, nope, its not , just being sarcastic well I've got exactly five more minutes and I'm officially done with my first college assignment. I wonder how many words I've written,  babbling on and on is something I could do. well I just got a new neighbor in the lab, she's pretty cute, I wonder if I should talk to her,  naaaaa, seeems to involved with what shes about to do, oh well, maybe ill see her around, yeah right!, in this place no way. man I wish this one girl went here, PROPNAME, she was my high school crush, she was a good friend of mine but I never really asked her out or anythin, I thing she was dating someone at the time, oh wel, thats why I got to be aggressive over here, its a fresh new start. two more minutes left, well I just had to rub my nose it was itching, and fix my hair. well I got one minute maybe ill start on the other assignment, but I don't know how long that would. done 
__label__label0 I don't like computers really,  they are kind of a pain in the arse, but things are getting better, you know,  people learning new things, new methods of compression and technology makes you stop and thinks when is a computer going to be too fast. . my parents are okay too I guess they just aren't in the "loop:" as one might say,  always having to show them how or bring them up to date and shite, but . . school's fun, math is not okay. PROPNAME PROPNAME is awesome I'd love to meet one day. lot's of people listen to her, why should I be the only one to get to meet her?  carl thinks he can play bass, but he can. why?  why does jimmy stink?  why do people love anime so much?  ani is a hottie. often in class I find my self fantizing about what is would be like to meet her. just hang out with her and stuff. be all buddy buddy, get a fone call everyonce and a while and just see hwo things are going down. making sure she okay, even tho she's married,  I don't' think it will last, she's too free and out will mr. difranco is never around always at home,  I think it's first love syndrome. oh well.

__label__label1 ok, right now I feel tired and annoyed. maybe because I just broke up with my boyfriend of 00 months but maybe its because I couldnt get this website to work forever or the fact that I went to bed at two for no reason. putting the tired aside, I'm also pretty exited. my brother is teaching me how to solve a rubiks cube. I love doing things like that, but sometimes I give up too easily. not now though, I can't. not about the rubiks cube, but about the business school that everyone I talk to feels the need to tell me how difficult it is to get in,  but I'm not giving up. I'm trying to adjust to austin and its really not that hard, I just don't want to call it my home because its not- I've lived in houston my entire life. that's my home. even though I was raised in houston, ill end up in colorado. I feel like I'm trying to make conversation to a comuter which doesn't really work so ill just tell you about me. I love the color blue-any shade of blue, I love them all. I love cold weather even though I don't know what its like to be in a snow storm or shovel snow to get out of the driveway. I want a big truck when I'm old-not to show off but to be comfortable. I want to work, not be a housewife even though I do want kids maybe two or three. I admire my mom. she struggles and I love her. I was raised mormon even though I am not mormon anymore. I love dave matthews and sarah maclaclan  thier perceptions of life are awesome  I love songs that hit me right in the heart whether its an uplifting song or not. I love writing even though it takes me forever to write something worth reading. I like kissing. only when its sweet and meaningful for him and me. I love being a friend. helping those that I care about-it just makes me tingle inside. even though I wasnt always like that. I used to have the best scream. I was a selfish kid. I threw fits. I'm better, now I like to share. I didnot smile until I was two. sometimes I worry I have a bad heart because I can randomly have my heart go wild (literaly)  I wonder sometimes too if I got my moms manic depression. I'm not a sad person overall but I can be a lot. I always wondered how that worked too. maybe this course will help me understand. I like beer, but not too much. I used to drink to get my mind of things, now I realize that was dumb. now I write to get it off my chest. what do I think about?  god. the world. people. why?  I don't stand up to my dad even though my front pretends I do. I really just avoid him. his wife is evil, but her kids are the best. how do things like that work out? I have four brothers and a sister. I love them all. they are all so interesting and so individualistic. I have an ex boyfriend named ben that I am obsessed with and so does my roomate, mary. we both wore the same prom dress and bought the same bedding even though we did not shop together. I want her dad to mary my mom  hes neat. he writes for the houston chronicle and my mom is an english teacher. even though it wasnt her choice. she had to start working to be financially stable to avoid my dad. that s why I'm determined to make it in the business school and not be a housewife and drive a big truck. 
__label__label1 well here I am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. I don't like hearing music while I work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. I have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. I don't need music in there screwing things up while I'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as I do. I keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that I neeed or want or should do. but will I ever get to them?  sometimes I think I will never be bored. I would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, "hey, I have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. "  that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps I will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that I am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do SOMETHING that my mind tells me should be done. even if I had no school work, even if I finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then I'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated "projects. "  to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. I'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. I'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible?  that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streamS of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. I could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy I am, how stressed my life is right now. I could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. I could speak of the things I want in life -- the never ending flow of "man I want to do that someday"s. I could gripe. I could gripe about anything and everything. I could turn philosophical. I could question. I could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet I am thinking of them all at once. so how do I transcribe that?  and then I look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. I have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how I love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. I wish I had written more as a kid. I wish I had kept a journal. I did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. I can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why I find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. I wish I had more time. I wish I could make everyone happy. I think I could if I had the time. I'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 00:00 at night, and I wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. I never get anything done it seems when I start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. I guess I should; it's saturday night. but hell, I went out every night this week it seems. why should I go out this night as well just because it's saturday. I should stay and work. I guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and I said yes. if I hadn't of been waiting for him, then I wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that I need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  I can't stand not to proofread things. I'm such a perfectionist. I had to make sure that word was spelled right. I can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but I guess I will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but I will rebel; I will leave it be. I will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps I should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if I didn't worry so much things would be much easier. I stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until I thought about it again. I guess I should relax in life. I guess I should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. I guess I shouldn't proofread this. I guess I should just hit that submit button. 
__label__label0 Today, what am I feeling. actually my roommate and I were talking about how we werer homesick. not in a bad way. we just miss home. I wish I knew what it was about home that I miss. is it the people? no not really considering I didn't have any really good friends when I left home. it it my parents? yeah some of it is that. but there's just this emptiness and I can't figure it out. I also feel like I am in a hella bad mood. it could be pms but it think it is a little too early. I really really hate pms. I get totally irritable and I was noticing yesterday how I felt really annoyed with people. especially my roomate and another friend. I figured it was just cause I was tired and sick of people in general but now I think maybe it is something more. well the stress of school finally begins. I'm remembering how much I hate stress. this stress is alittle different because its mixed with a lot of anxiety. I am a very anxious person at times and I hate it. I get very freaked out when I don't know what is going to happen. I guess you could say I have a big fear of the unknown. when I was applying to high school I used to freak out a lot and have crying fits because I didn't know where I was going to school. then this spring I would have freak out attacks about where I would live. I hate not knowing what will happen in the future. I think its kinda funny that I am a christian yet I struggle with the unknown. part of being a christian is having faith in god to work out all the things he has for you. but I find it really hard to trust in god and just let the fear go. I guess I have my weak areas just like all christians. anyways anxiety, I am really anxious about school. I have no idea what to expect as far as tests and grades. I told myself that because I couldnt drink this semester I would try really hard to get good grades. but it is just so hard to make myself sit down and study. I am areally lazy person and I don't like to work very hard if I don't' have to. I'm starting to ahve doubts about my major. I reaaly love spanish but I'm not sure I'm good enough to pursue it as a major. I guess there are just a lot of people in my spanish class who seem to be  so much better that I am at spanish and I get discouraged. anyways, I think my friend graham made a good point when he said that a lot of people didn't place out of spanish hours like I did and that college spanish teaches you a lot morethan high school spanish. I think he was right. but still, I'm just not real sure any more. ugh the people next door play their music so loud. it really is rude. I wonder if we play our music too loud nad jus tdon;t realize it. hmmmm. well time feels like its going by really slowly. perhaps my bad mood is jus t the devil trying to take away from the awesome things god did this weekend. well that's a thought. that retreat kicked some booty!!!!!! 
__label__label0 I don't know how to start a paper like this but I'll do my best. I really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all I miss my boyfriend PROPNAME. He means so much to me and I feel as if our relationship is falling apart because I live a 000 miles away. I don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. I meet a lot of people but I still always think of him. He is so understanding too. He said he would understand if I wanted to date other guys. But to be honest with you, I don't. I know I am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. I cry every night because I miss him so much. I'm tired of crying and feeling scared. I want PROPNAME to be here with me but that is impossible. I went home this past weekend and I realized how much I loved it. I never wanted to come back to LOCNAME. I hate it here. Nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. I wish I could go back home but I can't. I would transfer somewhere closer but I am in one of the top business schools and if I get out then I might never get back in. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, I am just so homesick. I guess in time though it will get better. Everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. It is such a big adjustment to make. I just hope I will adjust. What if I never do?  Then what happens?  Am I to be unhappy forever?  That is how I feel right now. That I will never be happy again as long as I am here and PROPNAME is down there. Maybe I will feel like that for 0 more years, maybe I won't. One can never know. Sometimes I write poetry to ease my mind. I find that it really helps me express my feelings. Whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that I could take?  I think I would really like that. I also want to  learn how to play the piano. Then PROPNAME could play the guitar and I could play the piano. That would be interesting. I wish Christmas holidays would come so I could go home for an extended period of time. I never thought that I would miss it this much, but I do. I think I want to live in my hometown when I grow up. It is such a nice town. Everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. And there I won't be alone. I hate being alone. I'm tired of being alone. I have friends here but they can only do so much. It takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. Maybe someday, we can be together again. At least that is what I dream of at night. He is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up! 
__label__label0 well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were "men". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 00 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now. 
__label__label0 I feel really crappy, today, I didn't get enough sleep last night. I think part of it is the LOCNAME loss on Saturday, especially the way they loss. Least the ORGNAME won last night. So far I haven't been very home sick. It might be because my roommate went to the same high school as I did. I have also been able to talk to my parents a lot because of instant chat. My mom wnts to get a web cam so she can actually see me. I think she has a hard time with me leaving, I'm the first child to leave home. The network here at LOCNAME is really cool. The connect rates are really fast. I had a crummy 00. 0 modem at home. My dad was going to get DSL, but we lived to far from the central office, that sucks. I'm really hungry now. I'm not hungry in the morning, but halfway through class, my stomach starts to hurt. It's probably because I'm used to sleeping late and not eating breakfast at all. 00 min to go. I'm not taking an English this year. That's good. I don't like to write papers very much. You might write a paper you feel is perfectly valid, but turns out to be wrong. Yet you put so much work into it. 0 min. Milk tastes pretty good. I'm used to 0% at home, but here, my roomate and I just buy the full vitamin D milk, yum. I hope there isn't a writing length, I'm having sensation block. 0 min. Time is almost up. Might take a nap, my next class isn't for another 0 hours. I don't have classes on Fridays which is so cool. 0 min. My alarm is about to go off. Set it for 00 min, so I wouldn't write too much. Time's up.    
__label__label0 At this very moment I am feeling slightly depressed. My roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. That's great. The first weekend of school and she decides to go home. She left me all alone even for the first football game. It's not that I am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. It gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. I'm also a little stressed. Moving to college has been fine for me. I haven't gotten home sick, really. And I'm having a lot of fun. But adjusting to how much work I have now is hard. I one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. That's impossible here. And if your not computer literate your screwd. So that means that I am screwed. But on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. I have no option if I want to succeed. Succeeding is important. I was valedictorian of my high school. I think that is a curse. It seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. And it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. I want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. I hope it happens. I really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. He is 00 and lives in LOCNAME. What a bummer. Not that he is 00 but that he lives in LOCNAME. It is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. Most of the time I don't know how to read him. What is he thinking?  That worries me most of the time. I don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. We once got into a fight and he told me that I had become to dependent on him. That really pissed me off. I don't believe that I had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. Bored because he had moved and I had nothing else going on at the time. How dare he call me dependent. How am I suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to LOCNAME and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. Dependent my ass!  It just really irritates me. But I don't know what to think about it. Moments like these, when I'm all alone is when I miss him the most. And I try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time I can't help it. then I have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. Its him that has the problem. Why does he have to be so independent?  I don't believe that someone can be totally independent. Everyone from one time to another needs someone. Everyone. So why does he have to act as if he doesn't. I wonder if my time is up yet. I honestly don't think that this has helped me much. Its just made me think more. Great. yes my time is up. good. 
__label__label1 Right now I am sitting by the phone debating on whether or not I should call this guy who is both my friend and currently the guy I have a crush on. He lives in PROPNAME so I miss him a lot. I also have this nervous/excited feeling. I can feel my heart race. I tried calling earlier and talked to his dad - I think. I don't know what to do! My roommate just walked in and smells nice because she just took a shower - reminding me that I still have to shower sometime tonight. I keep thinking about all the things I still have to do tonight - like shower, read for journalism, read for art history, back my bag, someday soon wash some clothes, and maybe clean up a little. Just random things but I don't have much time because my roommate goes to bed early and I/m such the night person. Getting up is a pain in the ass though. Those 0am classes are hard. I'm so tempted to skip but I never will because school is important to me and especially my parents! What a mess of papers on my bed!  Too much to do and too lazy to do it. I just thought about my email. I love email. I check it all the time and am so disappointed when there is nothing new. I had a crazy email crisis this morning. I hit the wrong key and sent all my mail and a folder to the trash can. What a scare!  I recovered it though but was almost late to art class. Now I can't help but think what to write next. I am still thinking about the phone as time goes by because I have to call - if I am going to call - before 00 pm. I guess I won't call tonight because it will probably just stress me out or bother me. I am done with class by 00:00 tomorrow so I will call late in the day. I miss him and worry about him and so desperately want to see him. He makes me feel so comfortable and always makes me laugh. I can't open up with many people as easily as I can with him. I miss him and wish I could might more people like him. I just don't know where I stand with him and I wish I did. I worry now that time to stop approaches if I said enough because I type rather slow but I did put honesty and effort into this. It is weird opening up for this assignment. 
__label__label0 I am really hungry right now. I wish I could go and get some cooking form home. I miss my mother's cooking. I won't be able to get any home cooking until I go home next month. That's a long time . I wish I could go home labor day weekend. I wonder why everyone else is homesick,but I'm not. I miss my parents,but I guess I fell that I'm going to go home soon. Why is this stupid song on mtv. I hate when they have those people interrupt the video to talk about why they like the video. I wonder wat I'm going to do today. I wish I had my car up here with me so I could go to the mall whenever I wanted to. I hate being immobile and relying on other people to tote me around. I need to go pick up some trashbags for my room. I wonder if the Jexter store is open. I don't fell like going down to the drag just for some trashbags. I ove this song on tv. I should put the ck in and listen to it. That reminds me I should meet my roommates who always play that loud music across from the bathroom. I guess I'll meet them when we finally have our wing meeting. I feel like going to that stepshow today, but I don't have a way. That's another reason why I wish I had my own car. I really need to wash my clothes today. I don't feel like it ,but I don't do it now I'll never do it. I'm glad my mom taught me how to wash clothes. That would be pretty bad if I went of to college and didn't know how to wash clothes like my roommate. That's one downside to living on your own, your parents don't do your laundry anymore. Now that's stupid. How are people supposed to know that on saturdays the parking spaces by the field are reserved. I can't even contact PROPNAME so she can move her car. I don't understand why they didn't tell people when they assigned parking spaces. I hope they don't tow her car. She should have left her brother's phone number. She doesn't need anything else bad to happen to her. She already doesn't like being here. Poor thing I hope she feels better soon. I can't think of anything to say to make her feel better. I know I look bad because I haven't shed a tear over my parents and she's been bawling. Okay my 00 minutes are up so I'm going to quit typing now. 
__label__label1 How strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. The only sounds I hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. I hope I am not making too much noise. I don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. I can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. I wonder if my friend has arrived at PROPNAME and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. HOw much time has passed. Oh I still have four more minutes. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? I think he is working. Should I go out with my friends tonight? No I'm going to stay home and read tonight. I miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. I wonder if my friends miss me as much as I miss them? Life in LOCNAME is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. I think I'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that I have been accustomed to all my years living in LOCNAME. I had a routine in LOCNAME, which can not exist here. 
__label__label0 I was writing a previous paragraph when this computer accident submitted my paper. I was not finished as you probably might have seen. I will continue from here on. As I sit here and try to do this assignment, many things come to my mind. One is all my homework assignments that are due for my other classes. I have spent all day doing chapter readings for other classes and now, though still behind in some classes, feel a little better that I actually made myself read for those classes. At this particular moment I feel very hungry for I have only eaten once today and it was at 0:00pm. It is currently 0:00pm. I do not know how long this paper has to be but when asked to write my thoughts down as soon as they come into my head, my mind goes blank and remains blank for a while. My mind is still held up on the homework assignments that are due for tomorrow. It's been 00 minutes into this assignment so I'm glad I only have to do this for 00 more minutes. Yesterday's lecture just came into mind. I love neurology so I thought it was the best lecture I have heard in a while. There's something about the brain that makes me want to make that field my career. It is a mysterious organ that we are just starting to unravel. I thinks its the challenge that we face in trying to fully understand it that makes me want to become a neurologist. Well surprisingly its been 00 minutes already and I have lots more work to do. 
__label__label0 Well today I feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. Like today I had to do this writing assignment to get it out ORGNAME the way and do my math homework. By the way, I have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. Anyways this weekend was pretty fun since I went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. I am a transfer student and I really miss ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (the college I went to last year). At ORGNAME you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Today I have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first Monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on Mondays. Next week will be my first week to start work so I am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest I am going to get with school and work. It is my first job so I don't know how I am going to deal with it. Well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time I don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally I am not a real psychology fan. I mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. I believe that God does everything for a reason so why question what God has done he knows everything. Don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. For example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. Well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. Also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. Another example is that I still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the Discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all I know. There are other terms that I am not to familiar with also and I hope I understand them better soon before the test. I really want to get good grades this semester so I don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I really don't know that many people here, but I have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to University life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. Well I think that is about all I have to say today, hopefully I will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses. 
__label__label0 I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 00 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 0 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. 
__label__label0 I have to my homework. I have to study for my chemistry and history. I have to go to LOCNAME this Thursday, so I wont attend class. I have so much shit to do. my mind is going blank right now. oh yeah. I have to go home and clean the dishes, wash my clothes, wake up at 0:00am, get ready and because of my homework I will not be able to go to sleep until 00:00. Tomorrow first thing in the morning, I have to pay my tuition bill of 0 dollars, go to the bookstore and buy my precal book and psy. book. right after I type this I have to go to ORGNAME and do some grocery shopping. since I have no food at home I will buy milk, cereal, junk food, chips, pizza, juice, Gatorade, water, bathroom, paper, tilex mildew stain remover. this is hurting my neck. it really hurts. I need to go home and go to sleep I will be so happy after I get this assignment done; I will be done with at least one of my homework for school. I feel so tired right now; I just want to go home and go to sleep. I cannot stand being here [library] any longer than I have to. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm not really sure what to write here, but here goes. So, I'm in a new state, in a new place, with no one here that I knew before I arrived. Sounds kind of scary, but I'm dealing. I came to texas from LOCNAME, TN. And it really seems that I am one of the few that are from out of state. Everyone is from LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME, or LOCNAME. And it has been rough, because most people came here with all of their best friends and here I am, this outsider who knows no one. But I was excited anyway, because I loved the school and all the school spirit. I came here early, because I was going to go through rush. Unfortunately about a month before I left for school, I was diagnosed with mono. I had been feeling okay, but started feeling bad right before I left for school. I had to skip the open house round of rush because I felt so bad. I participated in the rest and actually pledged the one that I wanted, but it was one of the hardest experiences. I had to be perky and cute when it was 000 degrees outside and when I felt horrible. I got through it and now I feel much better, but I will always remember that! Now that I am in the sororityI definitely like it but it is still hard. All the girls live in a different dorm than I do, and 00 out of 00 of them are all from the same high school in LOCNAME! It's crazy. They are all really nice, but it is hard to make friends with people who already have all of their best friends here. I, so far, like the older girls better than my pledge class. We have our retreat next weekend, so hopefully I will get to know them better after the retreat. Classes are going well, but I'm struggling with the huge ones, because they are bigger than my entire high school! I only graduated with 00 people, so it is very different here. It is hard to know everything that goes on on campus, because everyone else already knows what and where everything is and I have no idea! Anyway, all this sounds like I am not having fun and that is absolutely not true! I LOVE school, but it has been so hard to force myself to stay home to get rid of the mono when all I want to do is go out, meet new people, and have fun! I do miss home a lot. I have always been very close to my family, especially my little sister and my mom (and my little dog Missy) So I miss them all a whole lot, but I am dealing. I have made some great friends in my dorm and I like all my professors and the people in my classes. I am looking forward to going home for Thanksgiving to see all my friends, but I am also looking forward to a lot of fun before then. Okay, I think it has been about 00 minutes, so I am going to leave now. So long, professor, even though you aren't reading this! :) Bye 
__label__label0 I am so mad right now. I have tried so many times to go to the Internet site for this class, and it says error. The URL. I am upset. This thing is due Friday. So now I'm in word, waiting for the stupid site to be fixed. I just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense. There was a party in the town I am from, and some guy got stabbed and died. He was 00 and from LOCNAME LOCNAME. The weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed him. Now to me this makes no sense. They were at a PARTY. There are usually people everywhere. Oh well. I have a lot of stuff to do. Me and PROPNAME are going apartment hunting tomorrow. ItORGNAME weird, I've only known her since I moved here in August, and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year. We want to live at ORGNAME ORGNAME because it's cute. I looked on the Internet for some info on it, and there is none. I think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in September for a place we won't move into for almost a year. Oh well, we are doing it now so we don't get screwed. I was just talking to PROPNAME, my cute boyfriend, and I was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans. I always tell him what I've learned in class because it helps me remember it. I feel sorry for him, I wouldn't want to hear it if I were him. He's so nice like that. I ordered cookies last night from ORGNAME's ORGNAME, they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door. Anyway, I was in a friend's room at PROPNAME PROPNAME I hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff. I told them I want to get married on November 00, 0000 to PROPNAME. They laughed and asked why, so I told them. We've actually talked about marriage, and we both love each other that much, so it's cool. We want to live together in a couple of years. Actually he is going to live near us at LOCNAME LOCNAME if at all possible. He has a brother who is a year younger, PROPNAME, who is a pothead. He has a girlfriend PROPNAME, who I don't like. She's only a freshman in high school, but she doesn't belong with him. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are total opposites. I have a lot of work to do. Tonight I have to do calculus, read for my freshman seminar, and do my Italian work. I got a quiz back today from that class, and I got a 00. I was so upset. I'm used to A's. Italian is not a required course for my major, so I was wondering if I could take it pass/fail. That would be good, then it couldn't bring down my ORGNAME. I need to ask some one about that. I hate my roommate and suitemate. They are so damn loud. PROPNAME, the suitemate has people over now who are very loud. I like it quite, but that doesn't happen here at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I went through rush this year and got a bid from A Chi O, but I decided not to pledge. I am glad I didn't because they are out all of the time, and I'm taking 00 hours this and every other semester. I want to finish in three years, so I have to take 00 hours every semester, and 0 in each summer session. That's cool with me though, since I don't feel really comfortable here. My dad is an accountant for the LOCNAME LOCNAME, in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. We don't have the major bucks, which is totally opposite from the girls that live here. We aren't poor by any means. I have a 0000 Eclipse which my dad got me for my birthday last year. My brother is premed here at LOCNAME. Actually, he's supposed to graduate in December. He took an extra semester to take some business courses. He's really smart, but he likes to party. He was a LOCNAME, and that is just a synonym for partier. I don't like to party much at all. If I didn't have PROPNAME, I'd probably party, but I'm just not compelled to get drunk on Friday and Saturday and spend Sunday recuperating. That is not my idea of a good time. It used to be though. My sophomore year, I was the party queen. I have never done drugs in my life. No pot, coke, or anything. I did drink a lot, but I don't anymore. The last time I got drunk was a "Roundup" in April. I threw up on my own shoe. Needless to say, I don't do that anymore. PROPNAME has never been drunk before. He's so innocent to meet, but only I know the "real" him. I think that's cool. I just got an email from my exboyfriend. We dated for almost a year and a half, but I had to break up with him because I liked PROPNAME more. Me and PROPNAME will have been together for 00 months on 000000. He's so wonderful. I'm obsessed with him, which is okay by me. I'd do anything for him. My birthday is the day of the LOCNAME game. My family is coming down and so is PROPNAME (he's only a senior). We are planning on going to LOCNAME's on the Bend, which is one of my absolute favorite places ever. We ate at the ORGNAME on Friday. We got lost, but it was still fun. I was so scared when we got to my brother's house. He lives on the east side of 00 which is really scary. We were trying to unlock the door, and a car parked across the street and watched up get in. 
__label__label0 I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in LOCNAME, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, LOCNAME? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is LOCNAME, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 0. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 00 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. 
__label__label0 I wonder if anything is going to come to mind as I am supposed to do this assignment. It is really hard for me to do something when I am put on the spot, such as this assignment asks me to do. What can I possibly write about the 00 minutes I have that will be enough to satisfy the professor. I wonder why there are Braille letters on drivethrough ATM machines. It was a coincidence that I mentioned that to my friend and then in Family Relationships the professor mentioned it. What do I have to do today? I have a crapload of Math that I have been putting off that is due Wednesday. I still have half of it to finish and I swear to myself that I will finish it today, but I know that I will keep on putting it off until I have to stay up most of the night to finish it the day before. I never stay up to late though, unless it is a project that I am really into and I will spend the little time that I have to really do my best on it. On other stuff like Math or something I am less passionate about I won't care what grade I will get, I won't stay up past 0:00am on a project I am not interested in. Ah, a procrastinators life. But well, I am not sure if it will work for me in college. In high school I did just fine, but I am not sure about college. I guess I will have to wait until my first tests to decide if I should change my ways, but looking at it realistically, I probably will not. I always tell myself to do this or change that, and I do for that week but I always know I will go back to being the same thing I try so many countless time to change. I really want to be like my roommate. She studies all the time, but like my friend PROPNAME said yesterday, she is one of those people who really has to try hard to get good grades. She doesn't think I am one of those people, She isn't. But honestly I would not want a doctor that never cracked a book open until the day before a test and made all As to be my doctor. If she ever decides that is what she wants to be. She is always changing her major, but she is going to med school, at least that is what she says. I don't know what I want to be. I am confused. I tell her I want to be a vet, and then she reminds me of the day I almost vomited when ORGNAME, my dog, took a crap in my room. If I can't stand dog crap, how am I going to be a vet. I just realized that I have to pee, but I still have 0 more minutes to write and then check my spelling, I think I am just going to submit it like this, he said so himself that it will be graded if I have done the assignment, not my spelling. I just realized that I have changed the subject. I always to that. Somebody could be talking about homework and I will bust out saying "Look a my new sandals. " I think aloud too much. Oh, yeah. ok. I also said I wanted to be a marine biologist and she reminded me how afraid I am of sharks. I don't know what she is trying to do to me. 
__label__label1 I like this writing assignment. It seems easy. I know I'm doing this pretty early, but it's okay. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My roommate is playing his music pretty loudly but I don't care because I do the same thing. I wonder if I set my alarm clock. 0:00 is way too early for me. I sure do type slowly. I can still hear my roommate's music. I need to pee, but I can't. I have to wait 00 minutes. This is getting boring. I'm not very thoughtful today. Maybe it's because I am tired. I may go to sleep early today, but I know I won't. I am so glad that I only have two classes tomorrow. My roommate is talking on the phone again. I'm very delighted that I got a cool roommate. Man, only seven minutes passed. I'm getting so tired and bored. My roommate just left. He sure does go out a lot. I hope he doesn't wake me up tomorrow morning. Home. I miss my house, my turtles, my mom, my dad, and my friends. I sure do have lots of electronics in my dorm. I wonder why dogs howl at the moon. Man that was sure random. My keyboard is pretty cool. I still need to pee. Gosh only ten more minutes to go. I am halfway there. My shoulder is starting to hurt. I wonder how many words I can type a minute. Gosh, I'm glad that I am using Word. I cannot spell today. I still need to get my course packet. I'll probably go tomorrow. This is weird. I feel like I am talking to myself, but it is kind of cool. I wonder how people just came up with computers. I am sure glad that I am living in a society with AC. I would so be sweating everyday. It's so hot here, but not as humid as LOCNAME, that is a plus. I wonder if I am supposed to be writing sentences or not. Oh well, I only have five more minutes to go. I don't watch television as much as I used to. I need to start watching the news. I never know what's going on in the world. I don't even know the names of the presidential candidates' running mates. Gosh, I wonder how many words I have typed so far. This page is filling up. There are only three more minutes to go. Then I get to send this in. I wonder if you are going to read this. I need to stop my online slang for writing. My chair sounds like a fart when I move it. Oh oh, two more minutes, and then I'm done. That pretesting sure took a long time to fill out. One more minute left. Man, I lost my thought. I wonder how many seconds are left. My stomach is starting to make noises. There sure are a lot of underlinings in this paper. Woohoo, all done. 
__label__label1 I guess I have a life now, which is great for me. I always wanted one. Well, I did have a life before. I grew up in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I have 0 brothers and sister and along with PROPNAME, are all my best friends. Of course, there are things that I will not tell my brothers like when I have sex or whatever, but I will tell them that I kissed a guy. I tell PROPNAME everything. She is one of the closest people in my life. It is hard to be in LOCNAME and away from most of them. In LOCNAME LOCNAME I never worried about meeting other people because I had everything I needed in LOCNAME and my family. Now that I am in LOCNAME, it is hard to find friends. I am, though, and actually like the people I hang out with, even though I do not see them all of the time. I like going to live shows and now I have gone so much that I know people in bands and people that always go to see bands and it really is great. I do not really see them outside of this, but I am satisfied for now. There was this guy that I liked named PROPNAME who is the lead singer for a band. He is good looking and really is not my type at all. I did need a change. I needed to like someone who would make me feel ok and have fun and he was the perfect person to meet. I went to LOCNAME this summer. It was an experience and I went by myself which was great for me. I used to sometimes get lonely and hated to do things alone, but not anymore. I finally have proved to myself that I can take care of myself and that it is ok to be alone. Also, I learned that being alone and lonely are two separate things. I go to live shows by myself because I am pretty sure that I will see someone I know there. Would I still go if I knew that I would not know anyone? I do not know. I have not been put into that situation. Anyway, so when I came back to LOCNAME I discovered that PROPNAME had a girlfriend and at first I did not want to like her. But, I started talking to her and she is really nice and now I could not be happier for PROPNAME. I figure that if something is supposed to happen then it will happen and if it is not, then there is no need worrying about it. I think that PROPNAME and I had a little window of opportunity to get together before I left the country and it never happened and we missed our chance. I think fate can only do so much and that she gives us the opportunities and if we take it then great and if we do not then it was not meant to be. These windows of opportunities may come again, but they may not. There is no reason to wait for them to come because there are no certainties in life. I am happy that PROPNAME has such a great girlfriend. That is all I can do and just stay friends with him. PROPNAME does have this cute friend named PROPNAME who is also in a band. He is not the greatest band member, but BOY! Is he a looker. The first time I met kevin I had drank a lot and he was totally hitting on me. I did not take his advances because a)PROPNAME would not have wanted me to since I did not really know that guy b) nadia was coming home with me, and c) at the time I liked PROPNAME and wanted PROPNAME and not him. I saw him later on (after LOCNAME) and let me tell you, I kicked myself for not at least kissing him. He is SO GOOD LOOKING! Every girl that sees him on stage all say the same thing whether they have a boyfriend or not. About 0 week ago, we went to this party and he was going to give me a ride home so we got dropped off at his house and just made out. Man, I wanted that guy. We did not have sex, though, I cannot figure out why. I do not really know him and thought that since he was so good looking that he would be a little slut. I mean, I am sure that he was nice, but I was also sure that he was pretty experienced. So, when he was taking me home he talked to me and seemed pretty nice and I was shocked. It was a good shock, though. I saw him later on and I wanted to finished what we started and he took a rain check because it was late and he had to work extremely early the next day. One of his good friends told me great things about him and now I am interested. I do not want to start thinking that something serious is going to happen, but I cannot dismiss that it MAY. I just want to get to know him better and see if now is our window of opportunity. If it is not, then maybe I could get a good friend out of it. Either way, it is a win win situation. as long as he does not ignore me in the future. I do not think he is like that, but I guess I always think the best of people. We will see. 
__label__label1 I feel a little behind in everything I am doing for school. I have a hard time reading for long periods of time. My eyes cannot stay focused for very long and words become blurry. It's a constant struggle to understand each sentence. I'm not sure if I have always had this problem. I can read novels fairly easy. I really hate being in class with a lot of people. I don't like to interact with them. They seem to be very clueless over the important parts of the material covered in each session. I'm tired of stupid Internet questions that waste class time. If I had a computer question, I wouldn't stop class to ask it and make myself look stupid like most computer illiterate students. Students in psychology seem to pretend that they are interested in what is taught, but they really are not fully in to the subject. There are so many students who claim they are psychology majors, when in fact, after they take Psy000, they'll change their minds to something over and over until they slide into the working class. I cannot understand many of my peers. Their conversations are pointless and insignificant to their life as a whole. They spend so much time conversing over issues that they usually don't care about. I dislike the general public in the college atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoy the professors, but I can't get any intelligent feedback from my peers. I realize I'm not perfect, by any means, but at least I attempt to improve my intellectual state, somewhat. There are way too many sheltered students. I assume that professors have a hard time, especially with freshman, in trying to relate cultural differences. It must be extremely difficult to maintain the patience required to teach any level of pupils. Students forget that they are the ones paying for the class and the professor. Even in college, they still act as thought they're being forced to attend each session and assigned a certain professor. Most of the time, students fail to research their professors before they sign up for their class. I suppose it takes all kinds to make a world. 
__label__label1 I've never done this before, but hey, whatever. College is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments I've had to do so far for classes. I don't really know what to say. I just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss her. And borrowing her clothes. I miss my little sister, too. It's funny because I didn't think I'd really miss my family and most of the time I don't, but the other night I just got this sporadic mental picture of my Dad. It was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. It sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. Such is growing up. So, no one's going to read this. That's pretty good because I'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. I love that word. I try and use it whenever I can. Ha! This is crazy. Actually, PROPNAME's class is one of the best I have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. I only took it because this girl I know said she knew PROPNAME's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. And he is. And he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. I mean, some of my professors are crazy. I have this one professor who barely speaks English, which is cool and all, but really, how can I learn from someone I can't understand? And the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, "In LOCNAME. " At least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and I've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. I don't get it. Does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in LOCNAME? Because that's what we're studying right now. Bacteria. And it's not even interesting. I mean, who really cares about ERs and lipids and lysosomes? Well, I guess that's a pretty dumb question. Of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. I personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. Really, guy. But I have to take the class, whether I want to or not. I only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, I'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. Ah, geology. My eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. After this, I have some serious catching up to do. And it's not because I miss my classes or anything. I mean, I don't even drink. Except for wine, and that's really only when I eat out, which I do less and less these days. These dayswhat am I talking about?! I've been here for less than a month. It feels like I've always been here, though. Which is weird. I love LOCNAME, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. Seriously, they're nasty. And what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? They're not, most of them anyway. My neck hurts. That professor I was talking about earlier, the one who speaks English very poorly? He sings in class. Right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. And it's not like he's singing to himself. I mean, he's wearing a mike. We can all hear him loud and clear. And the only song he knows how to sing is "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning. " Except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. He's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. Anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, I would never go to class. That's pretty weird of me, right? 
__label__label0 I wondering about what I should write here but I know that I'm just supposed to write what comes to mind. I just ate a chocolate cookie and now I'm craving some milk. My nose itches. I can see my shadow on the wall in front of me because of the light behind me. This chair is really uncomfortable. I need to buy a pillow to fit in it. Now I'm drawing a blank. Now I'm thinking about studying chemistry after I finish typing. But I don't understand the work, so I guess I should just wait and do the homework after I go to the discussion session tomorrow. My chemistry professor was "sick" today, but the sickout is not supposed to start until tomorrow. Maybe she really is sick. My arm hurts because the edge of the desk is sharp. Now my back itches. It's this darn chair that's making me so uncomfortable. Now I'm wondering if it matters if I type contractions or not. I know that in a proper English paper, I am not supposed to say "isn't" or "I'm" or anything like that. But this is a stream of consciousness so I guess there aren't any rules. I wonder when my roommate is going to get in tonight. I hope she doesn't walk in while I'm still typing this, then it will distract me. But then again, I'm not doing a very good job at focusing on my thoughts right now, anyway. Hmmm. my thoughts. I wish I had not just eaten that cookie. That's unnecessary calories and now I'm thirsty. I wish I could talk to this guy that I like, J. J. He's on a sixmonth float for the navy and I won't get to see him until spring break. But we care a lot about each other and email everyday. I wish I had some music on right now, but I don't know if I should listen to music right now, anyway, because that might mess up my thoughts, also. I hope I like this psychology class. I'm thinking about being a child psychologist. I love children. I want to have two kids. I think I want to have kids before I'm oh, 00. I don't want to die before my kids graduate. PROPNAME PROPNAME is 00 and his wife is pregnant. That's ridiculous. That's traumatic on the child, I think. I just popped my knuckles. My mom would always slap my hands when I did that in front of her. My nose really itches. Sitting here makes me notice all my aches and pains. My ankle hurts and my arms are hurting because of this desk. I need to repaint my toenails, but I'm so lazy. I want to go smoke a cigarette outside really quickly. But I only have 00 more minutes to type. Wow, only one fourth of the time has passed so far. I just popped my neck. That's probably not too good for me. I'm going to have arthritis everywhere by the time I'm 00. Now I'm trying to get more comfortable so I'm sitting indian style in this little bitty chair. My closet light is on and it's kind of bothering me. I hope I do well in all of my classes this semester. My easiest class is German but the rest I know I will have to put forth a lot of effort to do well in them. But I really think I'm going to enjoy this class. The first day I walked into psychology class last Wednesday, out of all the people in the auditorium, I happened to sit right next to someone I had met the night before. It really is a small world, even thought this is the biggest college in the nation right now. My roommate is a raver. She has all of these rave flyers all over the wall. I've never been to a rave, but I think I might go to one this Saturday. I'm not too pumped up about it, but I think I should at least give it a chance. I just hope I don't get drugged accidentally or something. And also, ravers wear really funny clothing. I'd look funny if I wore "normal" going out clothes to the rave, so I'm going to have to borrow my roommate's clothes. Okay, time is up. 
__label__label0 As I sit here, I wonder what I got myself into. I came from a school of 000 people. I graduated with a senior class of 00. The University is such a huge place, I wonder if I'm going to fit in, or should I say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. It's not that I don't like my classes that I have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but I wonder what the future holds. My birthday is today, and I am finally 00. It seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. But now that I finally made it, it's no different. My mom called this morning to wish me a Happy Birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. Her little baby girl is now 00. She asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. My grandparents also called this morning. They live across the street from my old house, and I was continuously over there visiting them. She told me that she still thinks that I'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. She says it's like I'm gone for the weekend, but I'll return soon. And my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. Every time I look at him, I see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. Raising 0 kids is no easy job. The day after their 00th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 00 grandchildren, 00 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. I was going to read for the mass. I went up to the podium and I looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. I was so proud to be a part of that. I was thankful that God allowed me to be there and have that feeling. And now when I talk to him on the phone, I get that feeling all over again. I miss him dearly. Sometimes I think more than I miss my mom or my brother. Now, my step dad, I don't miss him at all. Sometimes I look back, and I don't know how I put up with him so long. He is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. He married my mom when I was 0 years old. I didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. He was just a total control freak. Nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. From getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and I had gotten into a name calling fight. He's a dick, that's all there is to it. I never brought friends over to spend the night; I never wanted any guys to come over to see me. My escape place was at my grandparent's house. I would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. All he would tell me was that I could come up there and live with him any time I wanted to. On weekends I was hardly home, I was usually spending the night at PROPNAME's house, she is my best friend. Now that I'm at college, I don't have to put up with him anymore. I don't plan on coming home anytime soon. My mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. Talking about what comes to mind is difficult. I feel that I have burdened you with all of my family problems. Don't feel sorry for me, I don't. Life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes. 
__label__label1 Okay for 00 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest ORGNAME my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to LOCNAME last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend PROPNAME who is now in LOCNAME trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for ORGNAME and the PROPNAME concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister PROPNAME is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a ORGNAME church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in PROPNAME, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in LOCNAME. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister PROPNAME, for example, is 00 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when PROPNAME is getting home. I think she said 0:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with PROPNAME. PROPNAME is probably lonely without PROPNAME around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. PROPNAME is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 00 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on PROPNAME's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! 
__label__label1 Okay I guess I should begin this by mentioning a little bit about me I guess that's one thing we can I mean I can talk about. I was wondering when I was going to put a period in. That's one thing I'm bad at, I forget to put periods. I hate computers especially when they act up I mean I don't hate them it's just there so sensitive almost like people. People are sensitive to things like for instance today this guy I was talking to. I brought up why I had only seen him say hi to hispanics. Because I feel that you should be as friendly with every sort of people. However I know he's not a racist but I just wanted to bring that issue up to him to hear his response. This question was what my other friend said had made him mad. But hey I'm just frank like that I can't help it. I think now that I'm getting into the mode of things I'm starting to realize how my old self is coming out of me but I told myself that I was going to be me. Not to stop or halt to my small voices in my head. Actually its just one I don't want to give you all the idea that I'm schizo or anything. However I wanted what drugs can do to one. Is there any positive effects from psychedelic drugs? But I'm too afraid to find out that answer. That is something that I've noticed here in campus. It seems to be the main issue at hand but I also think that I just may surround or interact with people with a drug background. Like the book said you group yourself with people like yourself. That's so great about college, no matter who you are you'll find someone like you or for you. Right now I'm working on the female part of that companionship. I read somewhere that right now at this age one is in an endless tireless search for love even to the extreme of promiscuity. But I guess its pretty lame talking about my love life on this assignment but "hey" no one said I was confined to a set of topic. In fact, as I understood it. it's pretty much what we want to write about it. Is that not true, I think so. Notice how I'm burning time writing about nonsense. Or B. S. as some might call it. I'm really glad that I didn't procrastinate this to the last second. The scary thing is that I'm doing this assignment at about twelve thirty or so. In that vicinity. I guess. I guess my time is up. 
__label__label0 Today was a pretty good day. I had only one class and then I had the chance to take a nap. I was so tired. And I am not sure why. I mean I know why, I am up until late on the phone every night with PROPNAME but I should be getting used to that right? I think that after over a year of talking on the phone that late I would be used to it. I miss him so much. I wish he were here with me. It seems like everything that I do or see or hear reminds me of him. Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating in class because I am thinking about him. That is not a good thing; I mean I need to concentrate on my work and my studies. Sometimes I feel guilty because I feel like I miss him more than I miss my family. Is that bad? I mean I feel like it shouldn't be that way. But I love him so much. I constantly wonder if we will end up being together forever. I really think this could be the one. I am really nervous though about even telling my parents about how serious we are. I mean they must suspect something but I know they would never guess exactly how serious we are. I always wished I could tell my parents more than what I do but I never have felt like we have any kind of connection in that respect. It seems like all my good friends have that and I am defiantly jealous about that. I mean PROPNAME, my roommate, has that with her mom. She can tell her mom anything. Why is it that I never felt like I could talk to my mom? I will never do that with my kids, I mean when I have kids I am going to keep that line of communication open. I mean I don't think they want me to be their best friend or anything and that doesn't faze me but I would like to be able to talk to them about the daily gossip at school or the party they went to last weekend or their boy/girl problems. I think that if PROPNAME and I do stay together, he would make a great father. I mean he has the same opinions as me about raising kids and all that. I mean that is a lot of the reason we are so good together. We think alike and we know what the other one is thinking. Something I just thought about is our friends. I like his friends, and they like me. But it seems that some of my good friends just don't think highly of PROPNAME. I mean it is upsetting. PROPNAME makes me mad because she thinks she knows what is going on and she thinks that I could do better, I constantly tell her that she couldn't know. She doesn't know PROPNAME like I do and she doesn't know the type of relationship that PROPNAME and I have. PROPNAME usually is pretty positive about things with PROPNAME and I and so is PROPNAME. PROPNAME it seems never is. But PROPNAME is a whole other story. I don't talk to PROPNAME all the time anymore being that he still is back in LOCNAME LOCNAME. One thing I can't stand about PROPNAME is his constant mood changes. It is just so hard for me to deal with that sometimes. And it seems like no matter what happens he always knows what is going on between PROPNAME and me and if he doesn't he asks me and expects that I am just going to tell him. What does he think I am stupid? He can't keep a secret and that bugs me. I mean if I tell a good friend of mine something that I think is personal, I would expect them not to say anything. The problem is that I don't always tell them not to say anything but I would hope being that they are my best friend they would be able to figure that out on their own. I think that is not too much to ask. Just the other day PROPNAME asked what PROPNAME and I did the other night. That is none of his business and I tell him that and he still pries. What is his problem? Sometimes I wonder how Matt and I have stayed friends for so long, and good friends at that. 
__label__label1 What does the drug ecstasy do to the brain? I have been very curious about this for some time now. Maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug. The reason why I am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it. In fact, in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school, it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic! Several of my friends have done it up to 00 or 00 times already! I haven't tried it since I refuse to do drugs but I'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does. Apparently, when on ecstasy, it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect. LOCNAME is everything and once listening, someone who is rolling (the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking X) can't pull away. Also, they say they feel as if they have "lungs of steel" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they can't stop. Oh, and the mouth chewing. Why does that happen? Their mouths jitter while they're rolling and after the drug wears off, their mouths hurt or feel sore. That's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party. Well, first of all they're sweating profusely and also they're chewing lots and lots of gum! Its crazy actually. I went to a rave with my friends last Saturday. It was at LOCNAME Music LOCNAME. At least 00% of the people attending the rave was rolling on X. Well, essentially, that's what rave's are for. Its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people, the majority of whom is PROPNAME like crazy! Anyway, my friends had a blast there. of course they were rolling. I had fun too, but not nearly as much I imagine! In fact, it was 0:00 in the morning, we had been dancing for at least 0 hours straight, and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired. Doesn't this sound crazy? What does the drug do to people? Have any severe, longlasting consequences been discovered for sure. I've been told several theories, some of which include the brain bleeding, there being permanent damage on the spine, memory loss, and brain cells being killed. Sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with. If it weren't an illegal drug, I'd definitely try it (provided it didn't totally screw me up in the future!) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is. And not just word of mouth. I've seen people on it countless times. They look as if they could die happy right then and there! I don't know if you're planning on discussing anything like this in class but I'm really interested in finding out more about X. Just out of curiosity! Well, I think I'd like to talk about something remotely related. One of the guys whom I'm talking about, in fact, he's in this class with me, is named J. I went to high school with him but we were never friends. We hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally, but we barely even talked to each other. Well he and his friend are living at Towers together and since we're all down here together we've been hanging out a lot. A whole lot, in fact. And I wasn't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave, a lot of people stayed the night at their place, including me, and we kind of "hooked up. " Now, ever since then, we've kind of been messing around well, nothing much. The thing is, we haven't mentioned it to each other at all. We keep doing it but don't discuss it. So I'm not sure what the deal is. I think I like him. well, actually, yes I do like him. The problem is. does he like me? I can't tell either way. I mean, he's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me doesn't mean much. He could hate my guts for all I know and still be doing what he's doing just to get some! That would really suck. And I don't want to ask him because, well for one, I wouldn't know what to say. And for two, I'm scared of the answer. That would just be awful if I spill my guts and he totally cops out. And what's worse is if that happens, not only are we in this class together, but we have to go to the same school for the next four years! What should I do? I don't know. I hope something happens soon that'll figure this out for me well, something GOOD that is! I've written a lot more than twenty minutes so I should probably go now. I guess this wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Whew! 
__label__label0 Right now I am sitting in my dorm room and I just got off the Internet with my old boyfriend, PROPNAME. He is still in LOCNAME and I feel as if part of me is still there with him. The worst of it all is that he has a new life now and he is finding new people and new things to do. Since he is doing this he has found every way to make it very clear that I am not to be a part of this new life he is enjoying so much. Although there is no room for me in this life there is plenty of room for tons of other girls that understand what he is going through. I don't really think that it is fair for him to expect me to just sit here and let him make a new life for himself that I am not in, but he does not seem to understand that because the only circumstance he sees is that I am in college in LOCNAME and that my life must be better than his so there is no need for me to be a part of his boring life in LOCNAME. I pretty much do not think that PROPNAME is that great and I would trade being in college to be with him in a heartbeat. I do not think that he is being fair, sympathetic or a good friend to me at all. He doesn't seem to understand that college is a scary thing and that it really helps to know that there is someone there for you that is a steady constant in your life during a time of constant change, such as this one. He just doesn't understand, and he just doesn't really care. All that he really cares about is that he is having a good time, which obviously cannot involve me. The only thing that he can ever see is that I am in college and that there is going to be so much distance between the two of us. The only thing that he seems to able to do about this is to put even more distance between the two of us. This really bothers me. And the worst of it is that I have been gone for a total of seven days and he has already found a way to replace the void I have left in his life. It makes me feel very wanted to know that I can be replaced in seven days. And the worst of it is that I totally want to be with him every moment of every day and he just doesn't want to be. I feel that if I were to come home for a weekend that he wouldn't even have the time to see me because he would be so busy with some other person. He doesn't even have the time to talk to me for five minutes yet he has time to go to bible study for three hours. He doesn't understand how unwelcoming that college is and how much I would like to have someone right now that really wants me to be there and that really cares about me. This whole situation is very difficult because we are so far apart and there is no way to see each other and there is no way to make him see how much I care about him or how much I really want to be a part of his life. And on top of all of my turmoil with him, I also had to go through rush this week and not get into a sorority. This all makes me feel very wanted and liked by others. So basically my first week of college has been pretty good. I am sick, I have all eight o'clock classes and I am not a morning person, I have been replaced in the life of one of the few people I have ever truly cared for, I have been cut by sororities even though all of the girls in my town have joined the houses of their choice, I live in a really tiny old dorm with a bunch of weird people, and I have broken the brand new portable telephone in my bedroom. Oh well, it can only get better form here, right?  
__label__label1 I am so glad I didn't go to work today, this gives me ample time to do this writing assignment Sleeping in is not always good but today it worked out perfectly I am so damn tired from working out yesterday I think my arms are going to fall to the floor today I wonder if that girl in the red sports bra knew I was checking her out I can't wait until this weekend I'm going out and someone is going to have to carry me in the dorm room I really miss my exgirlfriend back home I think I just need to find me a temporary just to have a little fun so I won't miss her so much Last night I got some really good sleep but not enough homework got done I really need to go to church this weekend I feel a sense of being lost when I don't I think it keeps me holy as well Mom is going to be real disappointed in me if I don't keep up the daily routine on Sundays I really wish God would have blessed me with the skill of being able to type faster so that I could jot down more thoughts in twenty minutes Damn it is 00:00 and I am so hungry Some Christians on Campus just stopped by and they have just made me put a ten minute gap in my thoughts because I had to sit and talk to them Maybe I'll got to one of their little functions sounds like a lot of fun to do Jester food has been real heavy on my stomach lately I hope it doesn't make me sick The other night I had a weird dream I dreamt that I pierced my own tongue I grabbed a long needle and stuck it through my tongue and stuck a barbell piercing through it It was so real that when I woke up I thought I really had my tongue pierced But I wasn't scared or worried that I had I was actually a little excited Which makes me wonder if maybe I should get my tongue pierced It's not really my style but I think the ladies might like it I am really mad that I haven't gotten a paycheck yet I am too broke to have any fun you just can't go to college without any money. The only thing that is keeping me afloat is the loan money I got for the semester. It's a lot of money but I want to save little What the hell am I supposed to do when I need to go to ORGNAME to get some Hotpockets or some bottled water The water here in LOCNAME is so nasty. That is definitely one thing that I miss about home is the good well water we had I was so good Twenty minutes has to be coming up soon. oh look, hey there all done, (a rush of happiness) and now I am thinking all of these unholy thoughts that I don't have to type Goodbye  
__label__label1 How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average PROPNAME. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the "s" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 00 minutes. 
__label__label1 "Today is the first day of the rest of your life" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 0000 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl PROPNAME was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from LOCNAME here, but at least her family's from LOCNAME. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was PROPNAME. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other day about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my "duty" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend PROPNAME comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in LOCNAME. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked PROPNAME for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the ORGNAME last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME does have it right when he said, "We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. " Last night, I learned about some of PROPNAME's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that PROPNAME girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 00 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. "Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. " It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says PROPNAME PROPNAME. I guess we all feel like that sometimes. Well, I guess my 00 minutes is up, but I do like this. Maybe we'll talk again sometime. See you, man. Take care and good luck. 
__label__label0 Well, I hope I'm doing this assignment correctly. I think it might be too easy and that's why I'm having a problem with it! Well my eyelids are very heavy. I'm very sleepy. It's cold in here but I don't feel like getting up and getting a blanket. I really need to do my Chemistry homework also. I'm trying not to procrastinate too much. I'm really bad about that. So I'm attempting to get off on the right foot. I'm bored. I'm looking around the room at my beautiful orange pipe that they installed last week. Just the thought of it makes me angry. I hate typing sometimes because I always hit the wrong keys. Next week is going to be busy. I have to pick E and PROPNAME up form the airport at 0:00 and I get out of my last class at 0:00. As soon as I get back to campus I have to go to a meeting. I hope I'm not late. I don't want to walk in late! I really hate typing! My feet are very cold, I need to get some socks, but I'm not sure if we are supposed to stop. My fingers are cold too. It would probably help if I dried my hair. At least that's what my mom always says. I really need to fix my computer wires. They are a mess! They should put a hole in the back of the desk so the wires can be in the back, but NO that would make too much sense. It has to be difficult! Well I've almost been writing for 00 minutes. Yeah, tem more left! My neck itches. My eyes are getting droopy. That dream I had last night was really good. I don't remember what it was about, but it was good! I wonder why I can never remember my dreams? Maybe I'm just weird. Who knows?. My feet are very cold. I have to get up and get some socks. Ok I'm back. I'm really excited about going to the Matchbox Twenty concert next week. That's another reason I wanted to get this assignment over with. Ooh, I've got six minutes left, I've got six minutes left! Yippee. I guess that's how you spell that. Well my spell checker didn't catch it. So I guess I'm right. I'm not a very good speller, but that's OK. I really want to take a nap this afternoon. I think I'm going to. I'm glad PROPNAME's not here. I have the room to myself! That put a smile on my face! I love Cheerios. They are one of my favorite cereals! Ooh, my hair is falling in my face. I hate when it does that. I don't understand why its so cold in here. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. I'm excited about going to the game. My hands are cold. I really need to organize my stuff in my room. I'm so glad maintenance fixed my bed! Now I won't fall out in the middle of the night! That makes me happy! I'm sleepy. Maybe it will help if I open the blinds. That blind man in the cafeteria was nice. I wonder what he was doing there. Well my time is up. Ooh, I even went over by a couple of minutes! 
__label__label1 Stream of conscience. Just typing whatever comes to mind. I just woke up a little while ago from an exhausting week of this thing called college. I have made many friends, but still looking for that awesome bond, my best friend PROPNAME and I shared. I am from out of state, so meeting people is a must for me. I meet someone new everyday; it's like a mind game that I play with myself. Can I remember his/her name? What crazy way did I try and remember his/ her name? I do want to go back home this weekend. All my friends that went out of state and those who stayed instate are going back home for Labor Day weekend. When I was small I used to spend this weekend up at our little lake cabin with my grandparents and my dad. My dad would drive up/down from wherever he was on business to take my sister and I up to the lake, for one last weekend full of sunshine and sunscreen. The word Sunscreen reminds me of the beach, LOCNAME trips with my mom and stepdad and of course my wonderful little sister. I remember PROPNAME and I would play PROPNAME in the back seat of the pickup all 00 hours to LOCNAME. Goodness writing from my conscience brings back a lot of memories. I am growing up, that's what everyone says anyway when you go off to school. Here I am its hard to believe that I am fully responsible for all of my actions, I have nightmares about not waking up in time for class or dreaming of scary situations with my friends and family from back home. A couple of "nightmares" I have had have truly disturbed me even after I awoke. So bad that I had to call back to LOCNAME to make sure everyone was okay. Even though I new it was a dream, something inside me made me make sure. Random change of pace, but I am hungry. My favorite thing to eat in the morning is a cinnamon roll, but since I way slept through breakfast this Saturday afternoon, I will have to adjust my system to something much more healthy. My abs hurt when I laugh, they are a constant reminder of my wonderful workout last night. While most everyone was out boozing it up down on 0th street, my friend and I worked out. Seems a little ironic. A little bit of me wonders if I am truly missing anything, just the social aspect of college. I just feel that its okay to do whatever I want, and if I don't feel like getting ready to go out. I shouldn't bother with it, another part of me wonders how can I say no when I never have. I am only seventeen so I use that as an excuse until I turn eighteen at the end of the month, to decide if I want to go out or not. I bought my first football tickets yesterday, the lines weren't all that bad. I just thought this entire drawl process would just be horrible. No big deal. It did make me a little sad/homesick to see all of the groups of friends buying tickets together. Time. Just time and I will also be part of that group. Right? That is what I keep telling my conscience anyway. I am anxious to reread all of these random thoughts from my conscience to see how I jumped from one subject to the next, or even what I did write about. I guess that is your experiment or research on this. I am looking forward to the next class and the research sign ups. 
__label__label0 Sitting to write this assignment, I feel I have lots of other things to think about. When will I find time to get everything done? I still need to unpack boxes, get things organized. The days pass, and more is left unfinished. I thought I was off to a good start, but I need to find a way to organize myself so that I can meet daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. My problem with procrastination is always adding unnecessary stress to my life, and if I could only stay on top of things, or work a little more each day, I would feel less stressed, with a better sense of accomplishment. What do I want to get done? I want to finish unpacking, decorate my room  that requires that tickytacky stuff, since nothing sticks on these stupid walls. Need to find more little pillows, and little desk and drawer organizers. Little stuff like that. I need to organize my pictures, decide which I want to hang up, which are best in frames, where I will display all my frames. I also have to decide which stuff I really don't need, and pack that up, and ship it home to LOCNAME. I need to organize my school stuff, still buy my aerobic book, and the right edition of the Odyssey for that freshman seminar, plus get some three ring binders. I know I brought some, but have no idea where they are at the moment. It seems impossible to loose something in such a small space, but I've managed to do it quite a few times. I need to balance my checkbook, pay my cell phone bill, and call my bank about my debit card that is not working. Did I not activate it right? I know I have enough money in the bank. I don't understand what the problem is. I have to remember to get cash; I have borrowed money too much from people in the past couple of day, not because I was out of money, but because I kept forgetting to figure out the problem. Until I do, I can't get money out of the ATM machine, I'd have to go down to the bank, and get money out, or write a check for cash, or something. Still trying to figure out all this bank stuff. I wonder if that cell phone bill is right. There seem to be some unnecessary charges on it, or ones I didn't know about. Why is my mom not calling me back? I know they are busy with soccer stuff, but I left a message saying I needed to talk, and asked those questions on the answering machine, you would think she would call back immediately. Especially since she expressed so much concern recently when she didn't hear from me in only a couple days. I need to get on top of my reading, and studying. Want to find a better place to study than my room. Too many distractions, my computer, my music, my phone, my ongoing room decorating project, unpacking, the TV, email, the neighbors, the stupid smoke detector, that is low on batteries, and is constantly, constantly beeping, relentlessly. And the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor, it is so annoying, between the beeping, and banging, they are enough to drive my absolutely insane. I went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping, it is so shrill, it's painful, especially terrible when you're trying to sleep. My roommate doesn't seem to mind, she can block out almost anything. I don't know how she devotes so much time to studying. I wish I could be more disciplined like that. I would be much happier with myself. But, I am having so much fun. Will study later tonight at LOCNAME and Noble's with PROPNAME. We'll see how that place is for studying. It's hard not having my car, although most people have theirs. It's nice not to be the responsible driver, and to have to pay for gas parking, or worry about getting lost, the ridiculous one way streets, and no road signs hardly to help you out, but still at times it would be much easier if I had it here. Next year, I will but what car will I have? What are my parents going to decide about that? What about molly? What will she drive? Will I get my prelude? Will that be too hard on my parents? How are they handling sorority costs? Should I get a job soon, to help with all that? How are my bills going to be this month? I'm sure the long distance bill on my regular phone line will be out of control. Try to use my cell phone more, free long distance, but not sure exactly how long I have the extra minutes for. Will john go by my parents' house tonight and set up his ticket? It makes me really nervous, not quite sure why. I know he want to come, and I know he's planning on it, but I want to see him so bad, and miss him so much, I don't want to get my hopes up too high, in case things don't work out. How will things be when he comes, how will be people like him?. Will they be accepting of him? What about the whole tattoo thing and the way he dresses? I want him to bring all his long sleeved shirts and nice clothes, but I do not not want him to change for anyone, nor do I want him to change. I love him exactly the way he is, and wish there were more people like that here, but I don't want him to be uncomfortable, or other people to judge him or make him feel uncomfortable. I want everyone to like him and for him to have a good experience. Even though I know he's not coming to go to a bunch of parties, or meet a bunch of people, he'll be here to spend time with me, but I still want to take him out, take him to the game, show him how big and fun, and cool the parties are here. Definitely won't be going to any SigEp functions, I know how they are about outsider guys, especially someone like john. I could never be embarrassed of him, but it might be uncomfortable, especially if any guys give him a hard time, and then I'll feel like I brought someone who wasn't supposed to be there, like with PROPNAME the other day. That was a really bad experience. I don't want anyone to make john feel that way. Having a car would be nice for when he comes, could pick him up from the airport, take him to cool places, the oasis, the lake, mt. whatever where the ORGNAME girls ate tonight. There are so many pretty, cool things, three days is not nearly enough. But, the time will be spent well, and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him, or make it harder, because he'll be fresh in my mind. They say out of sight, out of mind, and I believe that to be very true. Same went for mike. But, the longer I'm away, the less I think about john, and the less I truly miss him. I think the same goes for him. It doesn't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when I first was here. But of course that should be expected and it was. I don't like the way some things are here. I want to get out and meet some different kinds of people, or meet nonfrat type boys, because I'm not liking the conservative style that much. It's not what I 'm used to. I definitely don't like how money and status are such an issue. It's ridiculous, it reminds me of the movies. I didn't think people like that really existed. I left LOCNAME thinking I was getting away from all the selfabsorbed, selfimage, stuff, that I was really growing sick of, only to come somewhere and feel as though I'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery, based on money, family name, status, having not really anything to do with how good looking you are, as is the LOCNAME snob, but how much money your dad makes, or what kind of car you drive, or whether or not you buy an $000 shirt to wear to a frat party. It's all very ridiculous to me, and it makes me sad, and homesick for a place where it's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time, and where you're not judged by how much money you have. I do love how the boys always hold open doors for you, and pay for everything; those are aspects I do very much enjoy. I would not want to raise my kids here, I'm not even sure now if I want to live here after college. I love a lot of things about it, and I 'm having so much fun, meeting lots of wonderful girls, the guys are a problem for me. I went to college thinking that it's funny knowing this is probably the place where I'll meet my husband. I highly doubt it at this point in time. I'd have to find a diamond in the ruff, like PROPNAME did. It makes me miss john, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, LOCNAME, PROPNAME, even so much more. It makes me miss all my guy friends, and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite, but funny and perverted, to a certain point of course. I can't wait to see john, I wonder how things will be. I've decided to tell him how I really feel, knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way. I think he probably has an idea of the way I feel, I've probably hinted at it before. I do have a glimmer of hope, since he's been signing his letters with the word love, and wrote, "love, john on the picture he drew, and he is spending at least $000 to come out and see me, which unlike all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make, doing countless hours of work, and now is throwing it all into a three day trip. It really is incredible to me. It touches me to think he would do something like that for me. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME think about that, especially PROPNAME. What about PROPNAME, I wonder if mike will find out. What will he think about that? He once said, regarding the necklace and earrings from PROPNAME, that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever. Well, he knows john never ever has any money, never has a steady job, and mooches off of everyone else. How would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me? Maybe then he would open his eyes a little. Probably not though. I hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport, I know PROPNAME won't want to miss any of her classes, for him of course I could, it doesn't look like I have any test or quizzes that Thursday or Friday. I do have a psychology test the day after he leaves. How will it be when he leaves? I wonder if I'll be really depressed. Probably, I'm probably making it harder on myself. Probably harder on both of us. 
__label__label0 As I gaze at the screen I sit and wonder what is the meaning of friendship. This is my main thought at the moment. I've had rough relationships with friends. To me friends are the kindness that everyone needs. They are around when nothing seems right. They continually partake in your days' events. Friends give comfort that no other can give. No matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. Therefore a friend is always ready to lend a "helping hand". I guess friendship is a bond between two souls. A friendship is a promise to be "there" whenever possible and an understanding of one's feelings. A friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. In a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. The greater is the heart. For a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. Anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend. A friend has no materialistic need and can only be repaid with the same truth that is given to you. Friendship is a privilege and a great responsibility. As I write about friendship I think of my friends. One friend comes to mind. She is such a wonderful person. I love her because she accepts me for the way I am. For half my life I've learned to be scared but with her I know that it's okay to open up. So many things run through my mind that I don't even understand them. Thoughts of hate and confusion run about my mind all the time. It sometimes seems as if time just passes by and I can't stop to take a breath. People around me seem to talk but nothing is seen or heard from me. Sometimes I feel like all I do is live in other people's shadows. I feel that I wake up and I am really nobody. 
__label__label1 This is a very interesting time right now. Right now, I have so many different feelings inside me right now. This is a new part of my life, yet it does not feel all that different. I guess it's because there are so many familiar faces here and I'm still pretty close to home. I'm kind of glad about that, it makes me feel much more secure. I really want to take full advantage of my college life. I want to meet people, I want to have fun, I want to experience everything, and I want to do all that and keep myself on track. I signed up for a ballet II class and a street jazz class over at the union the other day. I figured that while I did not want to get heads over heels into dance again, I definitely didn't want to give it up because I still love it, so this was great for me because it will be a casual class and it's basically right across the street from me. I also signed up for an informal ice skating class. Figure skating was such a big part of me, but when I got too busy with LOCNAME, I had to stop, so I figured that now was the perfect time to start again. I knew it would be a beginner class, but I figured that it'd be good to work on basics. I took the bus there, got there late, and they were doing twofoot glides. No offense, but it truly was a beginner class. Afterwards, PROPNAME (the teacher) saw me jumping and spinning on my own, so she's putting me in the more advanced class after the beginner class, which was really cool. I also met these two girls, PROPNAME and PROPNAME, who were also in my class. They were so nice, they got off the ice before I did, but they actually waited until I got off and then they told me that they could bring me to and from the rink from now on so I wouldn't have to ride the bus, which I thought was just so incredibly nice of them. PROPNAME brought me home, and PROPNAME gave me her number so that I can call her next week and she can bring me there. I was very happy last night because 0) I restarted a hobby that I truly have a passion for, and 0) I met new people and I feel like I am starting to create a new world for myself. Seriously, that is one of the reasons that I loved figure skating so much, not just that I love the sport and that I love gliding across the ice and flying in the air to music, but because when I was skating, I was in my own world. It was like my safety, my refuge. So I am feeling very good that I am beginning to regain that. You don't realize how much you miss something until you actually do it again. I've been pretty happy with everything for the most part. It's been a nice and rather smooth transition, because it didn't feel like I was making too big of a transition. The main difference to me is that I don't have to worry about being home by a certain time to avoid making my parents mad. I don't have to worry about making my mom mad (because she takes everything so personally) and all that sort of stuff. I've been thinking about PROPNAME every now and then. Just passing thoughts about him, wondering what he's up to, if he thinks about me, that sort of stuff. It's not like I spend all of my time thinking about him, but he passes my thoughts very often. I guess he'll always mean a lot to me. It's funny, because I've been so happy with everything lately, but today, I am feeling particularly angry with PROPNAME. Just how judgmental she is upon me and how overly selfrighteous she is. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that (being selfrighteous), but with her, it is to a fault. It's to a point where she's hurt me and insulted me and angered me. And she claims to be watching out for me because she cares, but that's not what I call leaving me to find my own ride. She's let me down in a big way and she has no right to treat me like that. I'm not normally an angry person, but I am really upset with her right now! I really just don't want to talk to her for a while. Going back to LOCNAME this weekend was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed seeing everybody again, although it was only for a little bit. One thing I like about having high school people here at LOCNAME is that even if I wasn't friends with them back in LOCNAME, it's kind of like, now that we're at college, we have some sort of bond because we're from the same place, so we become friends, which is really cool. Anyhow, my twenty minutes are up, so I'll talk later! That's basically me for right now (or all that I can think of and remember right now anyways)! 
__label__label1 It seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and I lack control over when that thought surfaces. I have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, I need money. I can list what I need to do but once I get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. I can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. Well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, I think he's the one I'm going to marry. This relationship is just too good to ignore, so I wonder about him a lot. We have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. I've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and I noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. I still have a better work ethic than he does. But he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. I suppose also, I'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. I am a rather independent person. I don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and I don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but I rather spend a day locked in a 0 X 0 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. Now that is what I call companionship. I haven't had a best friend like him since I was 0. I don't think I would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 0 hours away. Another thing that concerns me is the way I have organized my higher education. I haven't really picked out a major, I'm not even on a reasonable track. I'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what I like to read about but I don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. I like math too, and I want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though I don't plan on majoring in any of those. My major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and English classes, and I absolutely hate English. I wanted to go to UT because I wanted to learn more. I like some of school in that I like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that I would have never thought existed. But the way UT works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. We are learning in order to work. Why can't we learn just to learn. Maybe I will be a social science major. 
__label__label0 I cannot believe that I have only been back home for a couple of days and already I want to go back to UT. I guess in a weird way I consider UT my home now. It is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. I am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. I see things differently now than I used to and am starting to wonder if I even want what I used to. I want to go into journalism, but ever since I got to UT everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. I am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that I would love even more? I am only eighteen, I could not possible know right now what I want to do with the rest of my life. I have a good idea, but I cannot know for sure. Yet everyone expects me to know what I want. I do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. Personally, I just love the process of learning interesting things. I have been waiting forever to go to college just so I could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. Every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. In my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. It was a typical high school. Academics were mediocre, but football was God. The athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. Athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. Some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. In a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. I do not really think I learned much in high school. I learned more in three weeks in LOCNAME than I did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. I had all these romantics notions of LOCNAME and LOCNAME, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. I really want to go back there sometime. LOCNAME was so gorgeous, and I thought I would hate it. In the end, it was one of the best places we visited. Most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but I think it prepared me a lot for college. I had to interact with a lot of people that I did not know really well. I also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the Jester Dorms. Who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! It is kind of weird being in a dorm. Instead of having to drive to see my friends, I could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. We are practically living together. I just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. It just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. We either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. Unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. Two of my good friends are coming to school here. It really is a good thing too because I am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. I can talk and talk once you get me going, but I'm not really good at those first meetings. Things always seem too awkward to me. Then I just feel uncomfortable. I think that is why I usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. It is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. In time though, I should be able to relax and deal with all these things. I hope, anyway. 
__label__label1 I hate the guy next door to me He is so fricking annoying. PROPNAME I want to kill him. His music is blasting so loud right now and I can't even think and he's just talking away and I want to go to sleep and take a nap I think I only got like a couple of hours of sleep last night so I'm tired and I didn't get to eat breakfast My bed makes all these squeaky noises when I sleep and it's really annoying and my pillows keep following off the bed I don't like my green book sack it's not that pretty I think it looks ugly I'd rather have my red Gap book sack People at ORGNAME don't seem to care about clothes but maybe Asians care about clothes Hmmm Enok seems really soft but hard, he's like a tough guy but not and I'm ugh what's wrong with that boy. Man it just seems like all he ever does is play on his stupid computer and he's getting mean now. He was really mean when I asked him about the fire drill the other day because he's probably fake like that like PROPNAME Gosh PROPNAME annoys the crap out of me I hope he doesn't come to UT because that would just be horrible. But knowing my luck he's going to come to UT and that would just be great PROPNAME's a pretty good roommate but I think he might be getting annoyed with me or something because I sleep later than he does and I think I talk more than he does something is wrong with him too because he never talks now I look at him differently for some strange reason and I want to be a bad kid again rather than the 'good' Christian boy I used to be I want a tattoo and I want some piercings hmmm that would be cool and my classes are okay but I have this guilty feeing and I don't know why I don't know if my friends here are true or not, maybe it's better if I just keep to myself more because I have this bad feeling that I haven't really met someone that's truly there you know I mean Debra is nice and all but still I think she might be fake and Sing just uses me he looks like a damn alien it's so gross ahhh I have to wash my face in a few seconds after I'm done with this because I think I'm getting acne again and that would just be horrible I though asians weren't supposed to get acne. My god the guy next door finally turned off his music thank god!  
__label__label0 This morning I was late ORGNAME my calculus discussion class. I was trying to catch up on reading last night and thought I could finish it all at once. I was wrong. I read most of it and finished ORGNAME rest this afternoon. The stuff I read last night while I was half awake didn't stay in my head. I glanced over those sections this morning, but I don't remember most of it. I think I need to divide my time more wisely because I don't think I will retain anything this way. Since I didn't get enough sleep last night, I tried to take a nap around 0:00 after I got back from my biology discussion. I couldn't fall asleep so I thought I would read ORGNAME ORGNAME for the ORGNAME ORGNAME, a book one of my cousins gave me for graduation. I read a funny story about how this one student took intro to psychology and fed his family back home all the new info he learned. He would relate what he learned in class to the simplest situations that happened at home. His parents were a little bit annoyed, but he was trying to apply his learning to everyday life. I liked how it happened to be about what I was studying. Anyway, after that, I shut my eyes and tried to sleep. I don't think I was actually asleep, but I feel less tired now. I guess that was the point of my socalled nap. My brother calls them power naps, but I could never understand that until now. When I was younger, I could fall asleep at any time and still go to bed on time. That has changed. If I sleep during the day, I can't fall asleep as easily at night. I think my nap today wasn't long enough for me to be awake tonight to study, but I'll find that out later. I am going to read some more chemistry and biology. I can't wait. Right now, we are learning the basics, and it's so boring. It's the stuff the teachers in high school just skimmed over because it wasn't as important as other things we needed to learn. Even though my classes used to be an hour and a half in high school, my classes now seem longer. It's odd that I keep looking at my watch. Classes are only fifty minutes, and it feels like forever. Some of my teachers drag on, and it's hard to focused, especially with no sleep. My chemistry teacher stopped in the middle of her lecture to wake someone up. She said that she wouldn't sleep in a cold, uncomfortable auditorium. She would rather sleep in her bed, with a pillow and blanket. She would rather be nice and snug at home. She wanted to know why students choose to come to class and sleep. The professor told the guy to go home and sleep. She wasn't trying to be rude, just telling him what she thought about how comfortable a auditorium was to sleep in. She said that we didn't need to come to class any other day but quiz day so that guy could sleep all he wanted, at home. It was so hilarious. I am sitting here thinking about how many different things I have talked about in about twenty minutes. I changed topics so many times, and this is probably how I talk to people also. I didn't exactly focus on one topic. What I started writing about led to something else, and now I have ended up on a completely different idea. 
__label__label1 So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. PROPNAME is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like LOCNAME and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that PROPNAME got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of LOCNAME for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word LOCNAME programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to LOCNAME next year. Not LOCNAME LOCNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the LOCNAME people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end 
__label__label1 As the past couple of weeks have flown by, I have been stressed about my work load. Like probably most college students I have the urge to wait for the last minute before starting any assignments. So far and usually I am always able to get my work done on time, however if I would only start the assignments a little earlier I would not have as much stress as I do now. Also after recently reading the first chapter of my psychology book I am wondering if the cause of my illness is to due to excessive stress. On Tuesday I started to have a runny nose which later progressed into a sore throat. I usually do not fall victim to illness very easily so I am almost sure that stress is playing a large part in it. At my house in LOCNAME I had gotten use to having my friends and family all within a five minute drive. Now that I have moved to LOCNAME and been separated from home for an extended period of time, I occasionally find it hard to balance my time. With the options of sleep, tv, eating, homework, video games, or just hanging out with my friends, it is hard to make a decision on both what I want to do and what I need to do. On the up side of things I feel like I am slowly becoming accustomed to my new life here in LOCNAME. I have started to develop a study pattern and my urge and will to do work on time and efficiently has increased. Over the fall and spring semester my ultimate goal is to have a high enough grade point average to transfer into the business school. If that transfer is successful it will only give me more motivation to try harder and be a better student. That is certainly the goal of me being a college student to begin with. I am looking forward to continuing my hard work and hope to enjoy the benefits at the end of the year. 
__label__label1 If I were to fly to LOCNAME to see PROPNAME, PROPNAME and I would have to go together, it'd cost a hell of a lot but maybe for spring break or something we could go. She says it's really pretty up there, it gets really cold too. I hate the cold weather. I have an image in my head of these nice clean streets, kind of hilly, in autumn with all the leaves changing colors and falling on the ground. She says it's supposed to be beautiful, like a carpet. And we'd go see PROPNAME in LOCNAME. Though we'd have to take the train, all sorts of new stuff. But I won't get to see her until Christmas and I know I won't be able to go before that. She's going to ORGNAME world before Christmas so I won't even get to see her much then either. I've never been to Disney world or Disneyland or anything. All I want is some of those PROPNAME PROPNAME ears and to ride the teacup ride. I told PROPNAME in eighth grade or our freshman year or something that when she went to get me some and I'd pay her back but she never got them. I wish we still would have been friends just a little more in high school. I mean I realize that the whole little group broke up when we got to high school but still. I really wish I was still good friends with PROPNAME. I miss her so much sometimes. She's dating some guy now that I don't even know, I didn't even know she was dating someone. We used to be such good friends, inseparable. I practically lived at her house an entire summer and we did everything together. Then I left her and she went off and became "popular" or whatever. Which pisses me off because I when we got to high school she was fat and not that pretty and now all of a sudden she's miss beauty queen and she's too good to hang out with me. Not that we would have anything in common these days and I guess it is my own fault for the way things went. But I just wish I would have gotten to share some of those high school things with her. I miss her so much. It's really weird because I have all these best friends, like 0 or 0 and its not like I ever thought about her much in high school. Every once in a while, but now that I'm here it seems that I miss her more, I haven't really thought about her any more than normal I guess. Although right before I left, for a couple of days I thought about her a lot and I really wanted to email her a letter of some sort, kind of apologizing I guess for the way things went between us. They didn't go bad or anything, they just kind of went away. I think I still might email her. The reason behind it all is PROPNAME. I talked to him the other day and it was weird. Like it didn't feel weird at the time but now that I look back and think it was just weird. I 'd really like to see him again sometime soon. I don't know why because I know it probably won't be good for me. Things are strange because if I'm not around him for a while I'll think about him and in an odd way miss him. But the second I get around him I suddenly realize why the hell I hate him so much and why I can't stand to be around him. I'm sure I have some underlying issues with all that that I just can't define or pick out. Well I know I do, I dated the damn guy for three years of my life. Three years of high school no less. My first real experiences are all owed to him. Now that I look at it, it was probably a really bad idea, in know it was, to date him all while I'm just being introduced to things in the world. Those are things I should have experienced on my own, not with him in my life. And plus I wasted 0 years of my life, there's no telling who or what would have happened in those three years. Or who I would have become. Which is the other aspect of it, I'm not sure which side I agree with more. Because if it weren't for him I wouldn't be who I am today and I think for the most part I like who I am. And I had all these experiences with him and I learned so much and it just makes you wonder what would have happened and how would I have turned out if I hadn't dated him. I mean I'm glad I have all these experiences under my belt because I sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to come here without knowing a lot of the things I do, and I'm glad they were with somebody I "loved". But it just really gets to me to think, what if. I'm so curious to know how things would have gone if it weren't for him. And now I'm even starting to doubt my love for him. Was I really in love or was I just fooled somehow? I'm sure I loved him as a person, and now I'm even starting to wonder about that too. Maybe it's just the suppressed anger or whatever that makes me doubt my feelings for him, or maybe I just honestly didn't. But I was obviously feeling something at the time. And last time is so much different than this time. That's what brought on the whole questioning thing of do I really know what it is to be in love or am I just imagining these things? 
__label__label1 Today I woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. I just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, Wow! I hope she knows that made me feel special. I hope I make her feel special. because she is special to me. PROPNAME what a unique name. It is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool I am typing on a laptop, I wish I could have my own. maybe I could save some money some how. I wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. God really blessed me. I worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. I got all the classes I wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. God is awesome. I am so bless through his love. I pray I make the most of it and continue be focused. I have so much time and yet I always want things faster. I seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. Sweetie wow I just can't get over it. I am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. I love getting lost in those eyes. what if I didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? I hope not. does she feel the same way? If she does is this the one? or maybe it is another I have not met. I wish I knew. I have to be patient. all good things come in time. I wonder if she knows that I wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can I see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder I am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things I notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe I thinking too far ahead. all I now is I like it. I like PROPNAME and she likes me. That is what I know. I know I want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why I am here in LOCNAME. maybe over Christmas we can see more of each other. 
__label__label1 Hmmmm. What am I going to write for my stream of consciousness. I don't even know if I spelled that word right. Oh, well. I guess I just write whatever comes into my head. By the way, I have to fill out my daily schedule for my EDP 000 class. Don't forget about that. It's kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands aren't as fast as my thoughts. (That's obviously a good thing). What's on my mind. This is a lot harder than I thought. Sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and I just draw a blank. Nothing to write about. I wish that I can draw pictures on this thing but I can't. I tend to be a more visual person and I get a lot more pictures in my head than words. I think I'm going a bit over twenty minutes, although it doesn't seem like it. I just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because I want something to pop in my head so I can write it down, but nothing happens. It seems like when you want your mind to wander, it has a harder time doing it, but if you're trying to concentrate on something, like when you're taking a test, your mind can't stop wandering. I guess that's the amazing thing about the brain. so unpredictable. At least to the untrained individual who doesn't know what to look for it seems unpredictable. Maybe not so much for an expert. Its funny how the mind works. Anyway, I don't want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so I think that my time is up. Until next time. Ooohhh my arm itches  
__label__label0 Sometimes I like Stream of Conscience writing because when I write fictional or nonfictional stories, that is usually the style of writing I use. I used to write a lot when I was younger and planned on becoming a writer. I stopped at about the 0th grade because that is when I began to focus more on school. I think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades. Those institutions should be places for students to WANT to learn, but now it's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an A in the class. Now that I'm in college, I'm trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes I take, whether they are required or not. I still have no idea what I want to be when I "grow up" besides a movie star. I'm open for all sorts of things. When I applied to ORGNAME ORGNAME I wanted to be a big time advertising CEO, but then I decided that would be selling out too much. Within the last couple of months I thought about dental school and becoming a dentist, but I still don't know. I would really like to be a movie star and I plan to save up money and go to LOCNAME LOCNAME 0 summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs. I know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still don't become famous I haven't even taken a theater arts class since the 0th grade! I don't think taking theater classes do much though, unless one wants to be in theater, but I don't want to stage acting, I want to do films. I think in films to start out with all you need is a little talent (which I think I have) and a good looking face/body (which I am working on. haha) So that's my plan so far. I haven't told really anyone. My best friend thinks that I am going with her to backpack in LOCNAME next summer, but I can't afford it at all. I plan on working at a pool hall next summer so I can make a lot of money and save up for my next years apt. and my famous L. A. trip. I would also like to take a bus to LOCNAME LOCNAME sometime and live independently. My brother PROPNAME did that a few years ago and wrote in a journal the whole time. I would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in a journal. I should probably get a journal now so I can record my little experiences right now, but so far nothing spectacular has happened. I thought that since I'm a freshmen in college I'd be meeting TONS of new people and be going on a billion crazy adventures, but I haven't at all. Most of the people at U. T. are from my high school (I have at least one person from my high school in each class) so it's hard to branch out and meet new people. I've also been stressing over money lately because I have to pay for everything (books, tuition, housing) myself and I haven't had time to think about doing fun stuff. I just got a wristband for the Texas/OU game, I'm not that interested in football though. I like basketball a lot and can't wait until UT basketball season starts though. I would like to make the most of my time in LOCNAME, since it's such a beautiful and fun city, but I don't know when to start. I'm going to LOCNAME this weekend, so maybe next weekend I'll hop on one of the buses and tour the city. Sometimes I like not knowing where I'm going. I just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of LOCNAME away from the campus and the tourist parts. One day my sister and I took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghetto/barrio part of town. It was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus. We saw 0 cute little boys around the ages of 0,00, and 00 and I admired how independent they seemed for such a young age. They got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go, but just decided to go anywhere and I overheard them say "We've got 0 hours, where do y'all want to go?" I think I'm mature compared to my peers at times because I had a dysfunctional family life growing up. Through high school though, we moved into an upper class neighborhood and I attended a very affluent high school which I sometimes felt like a liberal outcast amongst a bunch of conservatives. Some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off. But it's been 00 minutes so I will finish up. This was very cathartic, I should really invest in a journal! 
__label__label0 What I feel is that I have disappointed myself so far this semester. I planned on being so much more organized than I actually am. I look around my room and my desk and get really annoyed at myself. I think I am missing something in terms of college academic life. I feel that I should be stressed and overwhelmed because those have been my feelings for the past couple of years. In high school, I was always trying to outdo myself and get more involved. By the time my senior year came around, I was so involved in clubs and classes that I was burnt out before 0st semester was even over. Every class I took was based on the recommended courses for LOCNAME. Every club I joined was so I could put several different activities on my application. Now that I am in college, I wonder if I am serious about my major, Theatre and Dance. Don't get me wrong, I love performing, and in an ideal world, I would become a regular on LOCNAME. But I always secondguess my goals and the reality of them actually coming true. I have performed literally since I could walk and talk. I haven't appeared on any major stages or on television, but performing has always been a really significant part of my life. It has shaped me into the person I am now. I just keep thinking. "is this really feasible or not. " It is one of the few things that I am good at and have been successful in. I suppose I went into the College of Fine Arts because fine arts are so familiar and comfortable for me. I actually thought of becoming a clinical psychologist or a social worker for the latter part of my high school life; I even took a semester of psychology last year. But I came to this conclusion: I have too many problems of my own that I can barely deal with, so how on earth could I solve anyone else's problems? The answer: I could not. I don't know. I guess I will get more into the routine as the weeks roll by. Hopefully, I will be successful at UT. Time can only tell. 
__label__label1 Today I am leaving for my grandfather's funeral. I am so sad that he had to pass on. I know that he is in a better place now and can no longer feel pain, but I wish he was still here. Even if he could only stay for a few minutes. I just want to tell him how important he is to me and how much I love him. I would tell him how strong he is and how everyone looked up to and admired him. I wish that I could tell him how jealous I am of him, because his life was so interesting and fulfilled. But, most of all, I would tell him how much I love him. I am not really sad that my grandfather has passed away, I am sad because there is so much left unsaid. I just hope that he already knows everything that I wish I would have told him, before it was too late. I find it so odd that every time someone you know or love passes on, you sit and ponder all of the things that you wish you would've told them and vow to never make that mistake again. But time passes so quickly that you never get the chance to tell everyone that means anything to you that the are important, that they are somebody to you. I guess that my twenty minutes is up. 
__label__label1 I am so stressed out right now I don't even know what to do. If it's not one thing it's another. Everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. I'm trapped. I have so much inside that I want to let out, and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself. There are just too many pressures. Sometimes I wish I could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. But it wouldn't be. Sadly, I'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who I really want to be. I wish I could just be PROPNAME all of the time. But, it's impossible. I'm always too worried about everything, but I think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. I always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. I also find it hard to express those perspectives. Most people just don't care, but I seem to fret over everything. Maybe I'm obsessive, I don't know! But to top it off, I'm pretty happy where I am today. I guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where I am today. I can't believe how some people really are. Some people I know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. They let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. I don't want to waste my lifetime like that. While I'm still young I want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that I have. I would love to contribute to the world and be the best person I can possibly be. I don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. I know the truth, and no one can judge me accept God. I want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. But the world is not that nice. It is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes I wish I didn't live in it. But the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. There's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. Sometimes I'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that I want to do. A friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. I like that advice. There's so much inside of me that I want to explode! And I wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. Well, I certainly hope not. I want to be 00 and feel like I'm still 00. A lot of times I wish I were 0 or 0 again with no worries or responsibilities. I believe being around that age was the best time of my life. I had no real care in the world. I was too confused to. I had no idea I actually existed in the outside worldI just was. Well, I could go on forever but I got things to do. I kind of like this assignment. It's neat. Well, I don't want to bore you or anything, and I think my 00 minutes is up! So, it was nice chatting with you Dr. P! 
__label__label0 I guess I'll just start out by explaining how I feel right now. Because of school, I've been feeling really stressed. Although because of our class I'm not really sure what stress is. To me stress is when I have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. I feel like my whole life is school right now. I live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. By the time I get to my dorm in between classes I have to leave in 00 minutes to get to another class 00 minutes away. The days have been going by really fast though. I'm always so busy. I try to just get my work done during the week so I can go out on the weekend and have fun. I'm really excited about college because already I've learned so much. I feel like I'm being able to think better about things. Or I guess maybe deeper about things. Not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. I've begun to think more about what I want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. I guess you sort of have to be like that at LOCNAME, because there are so many people. In high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. A lot of the classes push that during the discussion times I guess because the classes are so large. Our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else I talk to have an even smaller class than I did. It's really weird but I keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. I know of 0 people that are in 0 of my classes. Maybe it's just that I recognize them. I still don't really know what to expect from my classes. Most of them seem interesting except for Calculus and Economics. I really like the experiments we do in class. Ugh, I can't think of anything else to write about. I hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. Actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. So I guess it's sort of like a journal. I actually don't feel as stressed now that I've gotten this done. It's one less thing I have to worry about. Now I have to figure out how to copy and paste it. I'm not very good with computers. 
__label__label1 I am here, miles and miles away from where I started. things are progressing slowly but I can see what I want now. yes for a moment it seems oh so clear and then it fades. it does not matter what I do with my life only that I am alive. anything besides being alive is what the time was like before I was born nothing. I do not fear this nothing however I just know it will be at the end of all my experiences. so I better make these experiences count. there is no resting no relaxing when there are times to be had. I again get distracted though. this body I inhabit continually calls upon me to fulfill its need. if it is not this it is that. but it is the only place my mind has to stay. sure it is a great tool beautiful in a way but I feel the drive to leave it behind. I spend many passages of time trying to discover what feeds the burning inside of me, what will motivate me to take a task to a great level. I want to design I want to build I want to create. a need is present to put something not just something but something carefully crafted out there for others to take in and make it part of their entities. I alone have fed off what others before me have so delicately created and taken it in through my eyes and ears and other senses. all those creations have helped craft the person that I am. so I know it is time to project all this back outwards with a spin that is all my own. and when I do this I must not think about it I must subconsciously perform using the feeling that lay inside me. I have found a companion. we have discovered that when we combine our idea our thought our joy our pain it becomes a thing of greater nature. we are translating our combined impulses into a media, a media that will allow this combination of raw human toil to be available for others if they so choose to spend the time taking it in and seeing if it is a part of them as well. 
__label__label0 Three weeks ago I started out on an unforgettable journey through college. Although I have been preparing myself for this journey for what feels like forever, I don't think that one could ever be completely prepared for the adventures that lie waiting for them at The ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. My school year started with a hectic and stressful week many people affectionately call rush. The name "rush" cannot even begin to describe the event that should be called "stampede". I can only imagine what hundreds of girls running around the LOCNAME campus in nice dresses and make up in the heat of August would look like to an innocent bystander that just happened to be on campus that day. With all of that over and behind me I thought that I could calm down for the start of school and get ready for the classes that were ahead of me. Boy was I wrong. I don't think that I have had time to sit down long enough to think since I have been here. My classes move so fast and the stress of walking from class to class without getting run over or getting lost is enough to make anyone go crazy. But, with every 00second brake that I get I have to sit back and enjoy the college experience that I am having. Sure I am busy, but the main reason I came to U. T. was to get out of my boring hometown and in to the always out of control city I now call home. I love it here and I can't imagine looking back on my college years with memories coming from any other place but LOCNAME. 
__label__label0 Today I woke up really late and I had to run to class which made me tired. My math class is so easy I don't even know why I'm in it. Well actually I do it's because I'm in this FIG and that is pretty cool. It helps a lot. I don't know what exactly I'm supposed to write but I'm trying to just keep going. I know that I am happy today because my girl friend PROPNAME is coming to town and I haven't seen her in a week. That also includes my mother. I really miss her and I know that she is lonely. I also miss my brother and sister and even my dad. I wish I could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before I left. Speaking of partying I haven't done any of that since I came to Austin which is supposedly this huge party city. I think the reason that I haven't partied is because I have not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who I go party with. I also miss my party pals from LOCNAME they weren't my best friends but they were a blast to go party with. I wonder how they are doing right now. I think they are probably skipping class for no reason, again. I don't know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble. I never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and a lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school. That got us PROPNAME, but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun. In fact all of high school was really fun except  no all of it was fun. It was easy there was always a party and I had a group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better. Those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there. I mean I love college and everything but it is just way different. And living by yourself isn't all its cracked up to be. I mean I have to clean my room, do my own laundry, and stuff like that. I also think that I had good morals installed in me because I feel really bad when I party in my room, which I thought I would do all of the time. But I guess that also has to do with my roommate. He is just fresh in from LOCNAME and is not that accustomed to living in LOCNAME yet. But he is a lot cooler than I thought he was once I sat down and talked to him. I guess if you give people a chance most of them come through, except for the real jerks. I am listening to Prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to I fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that. I wish that I had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that, but I have neither the time or musical capacity to really do that. 
__label__label0 Right now I am sitting in my dorm room. Wondering whether or not I should do this on the word processor. Because this assignment seems so fun that even if the information doesn't get there, I wouldn't mind doing it again. I accidentally just sent you people a blank page because I forgot to scroll down. I really miss home. I have the music on and I keep finding sad music to listen to because it reminds me of my family. I don't think that I will mind this later, but right now, I'm having a bit of trouble adapting to this new life. I am not really too sad, just extremely disoriented. There are only a few people here who I am good friends. Even my boyfriend has changed, and seeing him change (he has been here for three months)makes me wonder how much I will change this year. He even looks different. I think that being in college makes him more attractive, just because he holds himself differently. I wonder if I will look different. I already feel more independent and mature, even though I think that I always have been. Just being away from home gives me a bit of a different perspective on things. People are up here and they are talking about how they are " independent because they are doing their own laundry"! I sit there thinking "what! I have been doing my own laundry since I was in 0th grade!" My parents brought me up, always encouraging me to help myself, meaning that they didn't want me to expect everyone to do things for me. Out of all of my friends, I am the only one whose expenses (personal and what my scholarship doesn't cover) come straight out of my account. My parents don't plan on having to wire me any money this semester, or maybe even the next. I worked this summer and saved my money for that reason. I wanted to make things a bit easier on them. my friends talk about their depleted bank accounts, but even though they worked as well, the only thing that makes use of their money is anything that revolves around their personal interests (aka shopping) I had to buy my own books, a good three hundred dollars that I could have used for something else, even though I probably would have just saved it all, because I love the feeling of having money. It is not just the security, but the feeling of accomplishment, and feeling like I am not just throwing away my money on material things. Even though I always want to shop and I always see things that I want, I never indulge because I feel like if I start I won't be able to stop. But seriously, I really do want some more clothes because I recycle the same shirts in a matter of a week and a half. That could also have something to do with the unbearable heat. It was 000 degrees the other day and I have four hours between classes. By the time I get back from my first two classes, I already feel all icky, so I change shirts. Oh, today I went inside a sorority house. I don't really understand what the difference is between a dorm wing and a sorority. After all, they are essentially the same thing. You get food and shelter and you get to meet a lot of people. It is up to you to build that "sorority" with the people in your wing. But I think the same kind of relationship is possible for girls who are living in the dorm. Speaking of girls, when my boyfriend moved up here, he and his roommate became friends with this girl who I don't like. She is over at their apartment day and night because her friend lives in the same complex. My boyfriend thinks that she is really funny, and I know that he thinks she is pretty because he told me so. It seems like they have more in common than we do. I am a really jealous person and I am really jealous of her. I feel like she is better in every way than I am. She is taller and prettier. And he laughs at her so much. My boyfriend cheated on me once in the very beginning of our relationship, with his exgirlfriend. I think that by nature I am already a jealous person, (WOW Pepsi One is really gaseous because I never burp and this is the first time I have ever tasted it. I just burped out of nowhere) where was I? oh yeah. since he cheated on me it is really hard to trust him. So far he has betrayed my trust but I can't help but forgive him because I feel so much for him. I always looked down on people, girls, who let guys walk all over them. And even though it may seem like that is what's happening, that is not the way I see it. I don't no why. I know that it sounds really naive, but I feel like we are different. Now I know that you should not judge people or assume things about them until you have been in their position. I know that I have been talking for more than twenty minutes, and I really don't like thinking about these boyfriend crises, even though I do it more than I should. Anyway that is the stream of my consciousness. 
__label__label0 Psychology is a class that I have always been interested in and have wanted to take. Although I took the course in high school, I feel that I will learn a great deal more taking a course on the college level. I am interested in this due to an eagerness to gain more knowledge about subjects that have affected my family throughout the years. For example, a few years ago my mom and I learned that my sister was bulimic. When told this one random day after school, I had no idea how serious the illness was. What is bulimia anyway? I feel that my sister also had no understanding of the trauma she was putting her body through. After many psychiatric appointments, talks with several doctors, and a listening ear from her family, PROPNAME has finally learned to overcome her problem. However, is it ever possible to fully recover from such a disease? These are questions I anticipate getting answers to over the remainder of the semester? I can not help but still worry about her. Sometimes I feel that she tells my mom and I only what we want to hear. Another subject personally affects me that I am interested in is stress. I come from a long line of stressed out family members, including myself. I admit that I put a tremendous amount of pressure on myself to constantly succeed, which basically means I set entirely too many goals. If and when I fail, it causes me to feel like a failure even though I know that no one is perfect, including myself. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom (or I did before college anyway). Therefore, my mom sees the reality of my success, but my dad is too naive to realize that his baby girl is not perfect. I contribute, I admit, to much of his believing that due to white lies I occasionally tell him, but I just never want to feel that I am letting him down. In his eyes, I am a straight A student, flawless dancer, fully involved in extracurricular activities, hardworking, perfect. The truth, however, is that I am average. I do work hard and manage to get a few A's, I am involved in several organizations, and I held a job for two years and did well. Basically, I embellish the truth a lot to my dad, which in turn makes me feel bad about myself. It causes me to stress out and have negative thoughts. Now that I am in this class, I am anxiously awaiting facts and meaning to why I am feeling this way, and hopefully find a resolution that will benefit me in the end. 
__label__label1      Stream of thought. this is interesting because it seems like i've done this many times on my own. keeping a journal of things i'm feeling or things that have been on my mind, but i can never quite finish a thought before another one pops into my mind. i've been at the chi o house for almost 0 hours today, but wait- instead of studying at the chi o house i spent those 0 hours trying to save an apartment for myself and 0 friends next year. that didn't work because you can't forget to speak to your father when it comes to issues of money (whether it's his money or your own). i'm a little frustrated because i haven't been able to get my computer hooked up to the ethernet service at hardin house yet. ok, very frustrated. i'm even using my roommate's computer at the moment. not that that is a bad thing, but hey, maybe i want to use my own computer!  oh well- she's never here anyway. i kind of like it bc she has all of her classes in the morning and mine are pretty much spread out through the entire day, so we don't see each other that much. it keeps us from getting sick of each other, and we still find the other person amusing when we do spend time together. on the other hand, my best friend from high school- i'm about to scream!  i was so hoping that when i came to ut, a school of collosal size, that it might be possible for me to get away from westlake; branch out; make some new friends; have some new experiences. while all this is taking place, i still seem to have this tie to my high school- her name is robin. she hadn't always planned on coming to ut. as a matter of fact, she wanted to go to baylor with our friend PROPNAME (robin is my closest friend, but i kind of wish she had gone to baylor) but one day she just made up her mind and here we are. still   summer and robin   or   robin and summer  . . why can't i just be my own person???  i enjoy having time to myself. don't get me wrong, i am a very outgoing person- i love to meet new people- i even want to dual major in public relations (and photography), but sometimes it's nice to just not have to talk to anyone. to just be alone. this thing with robin has gotten out of hand!  now that she's seen how much fun i had going through rush she wants to rush next year. now that she knows i'm going to do young life leadership she wants to do yl leadership. i drive her to church every morning and then to her house afterwards (it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of the way. but she's my friend, so i do it). i'm signing up to do texas angels next year, so she's going to sign up to be an angel. and the list goes on. i can understand that yeah she may actually be interested in these things- and i'm so glad she's wanting to be involved in things like young life and lake hills church (which meets at our high school by the way) but i need some air. it's even gotten to the point where i actually feel guilty if i hang out with/make new friends!  that's not right!!!  the thing is i know i need to just talk to her and let her know what i'm thinking (maybe not to the full extent) but she has a right to know how spending so much time together is hurting our friendship more than helping it. i just hate to hurt her feelings. it'll work out. i can't believe i'm writing all these thoughts down for other people to see. i'm assuming other people will read this because it's an assignment, but hey. stream of consciousness eh? :)  i've recently been reading this book called   when God writes your love story   and i wish i could spend more time reading it to get it finished. it's really interesting, although often cheezy, but it talks about God being the center of your life and the center of your relationship with members of the opposite sex. the thing that hits me most strongly is when it talks about how instead of pursuing relationships, we should give this area to God and let Him pick out our partner for us. I've known that God has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting God bring him to me. i know He will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually FINISH THE BOOK! :)  and that's another thing- i have NOT been keeping up with my quiet times recently!  not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know?  it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes!  they are ALL soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one!  and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 0am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not like i go out and party (and i don't ever have hangovers then bc i just plain don't drink at all) but i'm such a night person!  actually i dont' know what the deal is. ever since middle school i haven't gone to bed before midnight and now that's more like 0am.  but no matter what time i go to sleep early or late, i cannot for the life o fme wake up the next morning. it's an impossibility. time is almost up i wish there was more time to write though. oh well. 
__label__label0 Right now it id 0:00 in the morning and I wish that I was still asleep. I had a Biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. I don't really understand what goes on in that class. Science isn't my best subject, but I guess I am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. And if I don't do well in those classes, I can't get accepted into upper divison. I'm not sure. I have been thinking about changing out of nursing because I really want to dance but I just don't think that there is a living in that profession. But at least I would really enjoy it. I wish I were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. He does what he wants because he wants to do it. He isn't worried about his future and I know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. And he is good at it. I just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. I wish I could push myself more, but I just don't have the motivation. I try at least. My classes are really hard and I am worried about doing well in them. This is my first time to be away from home and I want to prove to everyone that I am not as incapable as everyone thinks that I am. My own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. He thinks that I can't hold my own and that I have to depend on everyone else to help me through what I do. And maybe in some aspects that is true. I have had a difficult time just being myslef. I feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what I say isn't as important as the next person. Enough about my problems though, right? Today I am going to get a tattoo. I have always wanted one and I have never had the nerve to go and get one. I think it is going to hurt really bad but I think that I am finally ready for one. I have been looking at what kind I want and printed some out off the computer. I hope that they can do the one that I want. I guess I am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. Today I have 0 classes left to go to. This being one of them. I have a hard time paying attention in this Psychology class. I just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. All of my other classes are just 00 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. But I added this class so 0:00 was the only time that was left open. I had to take it. Thinking about school, I am going to go home and take summer school at ORGNAME. I feel that if I can get some credtis there and transfer them here that it might take some of the load off for next year. I already came with 0 hours but that isn't very many. I am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 0 years. I don't know what I will do if I don't. I guess I will just transfer back home and go to school there if I can't get in here. But I really want to prove that I can get in here. I am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. I read what I am supposed to and work the problems, but I just can't seem to learn the material. I'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. I have never gone a year without dancing. Last year I was dancing 0-0 hours every week day and this is just strange. I don't excerise in any other way than that so I am starting to feel out of shape. Dancing was my way to let everything out. I wasn't always as good as I wish that I could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that I was good at something. Here I can't do that. I am just another person walking down the side walk. At home, in such a small town, everyone knew who I was. And here I think I know about 00 people at the most. None of my friends came here so it isn't like I really have a relase. I am going to go home this weekend, and I know it is kind of soon, but I really miss my boyfriend. Maybe I am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. It might be best if I go home, I know mom and dad would like that a lot more. But I am tired of doing everything for my parents. I never did anything in high school for myself. Mom and I got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life I was just trying to prove myself to her. She treated me like a child even last year, like I was still 00 and couldn't take care of myself. Being an only child I was smothered by my parents and grandparents. I don't know. It was nice getting what I always wanted, but sometimes I wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. It's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. Someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. It doesn't work. Besides, I get tired of writing all of that down. I am super duper hungry right now butI don't want to eat because I am really afraid of the freshman 00. I haven't been eating well lately. I won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when I actually do eat, it isn't anything healthy. The only good we have in our room is gronola bars and froot loops. Like that is healthy. At least I have been drinking a lot of water. Well, my time to write is almost up. Thank God because I am really getting tired sitting here and doing this. Also, I have a class in 00 minutes and I really need to leave and go there. So, I guess I have a couple more of these things to do during the rest of the semester. Fun fun fun, I can't wait. 
__label__label1 ok i have been a little nervous about this assignment, not too nervous but a little. i'm kind of a quiet person so writing my thoughts for twenty minutes is a little intimidating. i don't really like how a lot of the stuff we do in psychology is over the internet. i guess it's convenient, but the internet messes up a lot. it is working today though. i just bought tickets for jimmy eat world over the internet. they are one of my favorite bands. my best friend, PROPNAME, is coming up here to go to the concert with me. i miss her a lot! i need to clean my room. courtney, my roommate, has cleaned up a little. i don't think she cares too much that i am messy. she's messy too. she is from my hometown, so i knew her before we lived together here. we are getting really close. i'm glad we decided to live together. i'm glad i didn't wait til the last minute to do this assignment. i need to do my calculus and physics homework too. i also need to, well i don't need to but i want to go get a DVD called waking life. it is really good. it is a movie that makes me think because it questions reality. i like movies like that. i've been thinking about doing stuff with movies as a career, like visual arts type stuff, but that's only if i don't get into the architecture department. i need to take this psychology course because i will need to know how colors affect people's emotions if i am going to major in interior design. that really intrests me. i need to call kristina and tell her that i got the jimmy eat world tickets. she was at my friend jory's house the last time i talked to her. i miss jory a lot too. i haven't seen her in a long time. me and kristina and jory have been friends for a long time, since seventh grade. i miss them a lot. i need to call my friend cherry too. she lives in oklahoma because that's where she is going to college. i have about four minutes left. i hope this is the kind of stuff you wanted us to write. i guess it is because this is what i'm thinking about. i hope it doesn't matter that i didn't capitalize the word   i.  i never do even when i write unless it is in a paper i need to turn in for english class. my senior english teacher is a really nice lady. i really admire her. she is very encouraging. i miss her too. bye          
__label__label0 I just finished working out. It was pretty tiring. I haven't worked out in awhile. It's kind of cold in the room right now. I'm always cold. I dont' really know why. It's kind of weird. I miss PROPNAME so much. Gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. It's good that I can see and talk to him, but everytime I do see and talk to him, I just get sad. I want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least I'll see him at Thanksgiving. That will give me something to work forward to. Hmmm. My sister's husband is here for the weekend. It's still really weird. I can't imagine my sister married. It's quite strange. But she seems happy, so it's good. I feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than I am though. Kind of makes me feel bad. But I'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. I'm going to work really hard this sememster. I have nothing else to do really. I can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. With is kind of poopy. Because I actually get along better with guys. But it's ok, because he can't do anything either. I was going to write something and I just forgot what. I do that a lot. I'll like so upstairs or something and then I'll forget why I went upstairs. Yeah, it's pretty strange. Hmm. the tv is going on in the background. It's a pretty funny show. I need to go to the bathroom. I just drank a lot of water. But I still have like 00 minutes left on the clock. Wow. 00 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. I'm not homesick at all. I knew I probably wouldn't be. I've always been the independent type. Pipit is a pretty good roommmate. We dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so I don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. She's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. I'm always on the webcam, so I guess its' good that she goes out or I think she'd be really annoyed. I havent' really met anyone new yet. I guess going ot ORGNAME does that to you. You stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. Plus, it's weird. Even when I'm hanging out with friends or something, I'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. Man, I'm such a nerd. Haha, oh well. I think calculus will be my hardest class. I hate math. Ugh, at least I will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. But it's like simple math. So I'll be ok. At least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. Ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. I tend to do that a lot too. I always look at the time. Even though i pretend not to. I still do out of the corner of my time. It's like I try to trick myself. But it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. A lot of people are gone for the church retreat. I dunno. I kind of of wanted to go, because I didn't go last year, but I'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. I feel like all they do is judge you. The pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. Yeah, I think it's pretty dumb. It's makes me really mad sometimes. They have no right to judge. My spiritual life is between me and God and no one else. uughh. Yeah, but I think I'm going ot find a new church when I go back from college. That will be good for me I think. PROPNAME is iming my sister right now. I still feel kind of bad for him. They went out for like 0-0 years and then my sister marries someone else. But it's for the better. THey fought like everyday and he would always cry. SO that's not too healthy either. I miss my doggies too. Dusty PROPNAME PROPNAME and even Mocha. Awww. my Dusty. I want him here to keep me company. I think Dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. Because I know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. He's so old already. It's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. That's going to be one sad day. I had a bad dream last night. PROPNAME dream-cheated on me. Man, that sucked. I was sooo mad when I woke up. I must be really insecure or something. THis is the second time I've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. Hahaha. That's pretty funny. It kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. With a passion too. It's pretty bad. But PROPNAME has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. PROPNAME is like a brother and I think of him as a girl too. I wonder if he knows?  He should. people always make fun of him about it. But maybe he just think we're kidding or something. Hmmm. maybe we should tell him. Dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. I don't think I exactly have the right technique. I wish I still played piano like before. I want to relearn the PROPNAME song. Maybe I will. . if I motivate myself to. That would be really good. That music class is pretty simple though. I hope these 0 months until Thanksgiving so really really fast. I cant' wait to see PROPNAME. Man, I think about him a lot. 
__label__label0      I am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, LOCNAME. It is overwhelming right now solely because I don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. I enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. My goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. I am feeling a little homesick though, because I am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. I miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. I am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. Everyone knows eachother and I sometimes feel alienated. I am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. Which causes me to lose concentration at times. It is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. Especially at night when they come running in all drunk. I smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging Theta. My roommate and I just got through with PROPNAME and are excited about our new sorority. I know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. I am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. It is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. Im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. I realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that I will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. I love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. Our room is all tidy and neat. I know my mom would be happy. I really love this city of LOCNAME. It is so fun and such a party place. It also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. I'm not all into this every night party life. Don't get me wrong I love to party and all, but to a certain extent. I'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. You become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. One thing I want to do while at school here for the next 0 years is discover who I really am. When you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? I want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. I am contemplating on whether I want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. It seems like im always on the go here, too. There is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. As you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. I notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. My computer just froze for the longest time so for about 0 minutes I couldn't write. So i am going to start again, because for 0 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. It is making me very aggravated. So in case you know this I am still typing after the 00 min time period, because 0 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. Well, I am hoping that I will learn my away around LOCNAME soon because this city is very confusing. I just want to have a notion of where everything is. I hate not knowing my way around places. Well, I am going to end it now because I timed an extra 0 min on my clock and it is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     j                                                                                                                                                                                              m                        y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
__label__label1      My throat hurts really bad these past two days but I kind of like it cause when my voice is scratchy it makes me feel sexy. But the problem with that is two-fold, one- why should i want to feel sexy if i already have a boyfriend? does that mean i want a different one? and two i shouldn't be kissing my boyfriend if my throat is scratchy so it doesn't matter if i feel sexy. that whole situation reminds me of the friends episode when phoebe had a cold and she was a super good singer because the phelgm made her feel sexy, but since i'm not a singer i really don't have any useful outputs for my cold and it just makes me feel gross. what i'm afraid of with all this is that i'm thinking about what to type and then typing it rather than just typing thoughts as they come. hopefully you won't have time to read this though so you won't know about my concern of how   honest   my stream of consciousness is really being. sometimes i want to be an artist because i think that it's really incredible to be able to depict what you think something resembles. but i could never do that because my hands don't have the talent that my mind does- so i think of great things but then i'm never able to really express them, that's probably why most artists are insane because they can't perfectly match their impression of something with their depiction of something. right now our neighbor guy is playing classic rock really loud and it's kind of distracting me. i would go tell him to turn it down but i don't want to interrupt my stream, and also i  think he's creepy because he touches my stomach a lot and he gives me these really intense stares and i'm like   whoa?!   but another creepy thing happened today, my ex-boyfriends mom sent me this clipping of him in the paper and was like    just thought you might want to see this clipping about anthony in the navy. e-mail me to keep up and good luck with classes!   weird. one, i only met the lady like twice, i didn't even get formally introduced to her. two, how did she get my address?? and three, lady your son and i broke up. let's move on with our lives, shall we? there's something about the taste of sick in your mouth. a sore throat or something, but when i coughed jsut now it reminded me of halloween. strange. but that's probably got something to do with all this crazy stuff in the brain that's going on. man it just boggles me. my roommate is in the shower and i just heard this crash of bottles and she laughed. it reminds me of something i do everyday. i just laughed, she's a really great roommate. just like i have a great family and a great boyfriend. if i make the crew team i think my life will be perfect, even though i know i shouldn't depend it on that. it just seems like a dream. after being depressed for so long it's really nice to be alone and realize that i'm happy. i just have a ton of stuff to be thankful for. sometimes i think about the things i would change about myself and i would definately make myself more grateful, and i would be more prude about kissing. i think kissing is really trivialized and it makes me sad. sometimes i want my life to be like a movie and have incredible kisses that you can just hear the music start up with. slow ones that really communicate something. ones where you're not thinking about how the guy's tongue feels or if he has good breath but all you can think about is how good he makes you feel and how much you like or love him. i think the reason why i used to be depressed was because i wanted everything to be perfect like a movie and slowly i started feeling like my life just didn't stack up. but the truth is is that in the grand scheme of things it's like DAMN! i've not only got two legs, two arms, and 00 fingers, but on top of that i also have the great roommate, great family, and great boyfriend, great friends, a great mind, and not too much sadness. i think people always dramatize things because they don't know what they're looking for in life but they figure that people will suddenly pay attention to them and they'll figure it out. almost anyone wants attention- that's why people try to committ suicide, why people cry, it's the explanation for so much. how weird is that that okasy i lost that thought but i'm still typing. i'm a die hard stream of consiouicness writer, i breeeze buy typos, not a problem for me. but the classic rock is. i'm ready to destroy his speakers i think. music should say stuff- not just be a bunch of noise. music should be stream of consciousness because it would reveal truths in life. isn't that what it's all about? the ttruth? now i sound like my ex-boyfriend who was obsessed with plato and searching for the truth. he invented this kissing thing called the euclidian vacuum. it was way creepy. i want to talk about my cat willy cause i miss him. i miss feeling his little cat body sleeping on me and purring. college students are depressed cause dorms won't let you have pets- that's really why. that and the whole loneliness of sin thing. when it comes to sinning, you try to find other people who have done the same thing as you, but it just ends up making you feel worse knowing that there are other people in the world that mess up like you. i want to have some famous last line here but i think i'll settle for i just looked at the clock and i don't have time! MARSHMALLOWS!  
__label__label1 Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 0:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 00 minutes. i wonder why 00 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 000 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, PROPNAME's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult. 
__label__label0      I am sitting hear at my desk in the dorm listening to PROPNAME in the kitchen. I   hear the cabinets shutting and bowls that are clanging together. I wonder what   she is eating for lunch It kind of makes me hungry too. Now I'm thinking about   when I'm going to eat . I have my discussion class in another 00  minutes across   the street. I'm worried that I won't make it to the psych SI meeting afterwards   because there are so many things to do. I told PROPNAME and PROPNAME that I would go with   them, but I really want to go by the party on the plaza to see all the clubs and   organizations. I'm not sure why I want to go by there. There are so many different   organizations that I want to do and I am feeling so stressed out right now with all   the options racing through my head, but i don't want to overcommit because then   what if I can't handle the coursework and my grades drop. That also worries me. I   have three tests coming up next week at least in my huge intro classes. I am so   confused as to what they will be over and how closely I should be reading and   what I need to pick up on. That is why I really need to go to the SI meeting today.  Hopefully that will help. So now I am thinking back to what organizations I want to   join. I am already feeling so overwhelmed with having to squeeze in 00 study   hours a week for Kappa Delta. I don't think that much time is unreasonable, but it's   just that I have to walk to the house and that takes time and then I might run out of   reading to do and just end up sitting there. If it weren't for the rowing team, I would   be able to spend plenty of time there, but it just so happens that I row in the   afternoon, so I can't really get anything done for a solid length of time. That   sidekicks meeting was fun last night, but I really don't think I can go to the party   tonight because I need to sleep. I always falll asleep in that RTF class at 0 am and   I need to be alert. Oh, and I have that spanish composition that I need to learn   vocab and the verb forms for. There is so much to do and I'm worried that I just   can't do rowing because  it takes so much time, but maybe I'd rather be playing a   sport then watching it liek the sidekicks organiztion. I just don't know. I also want to   play volleyball, but I can't decide what level to play on. My FIG is starting a team,   but will that be frustrating because we won't be good and I want to play   competetively or will it be relaxing and fun. I can't decide!  I really want someone to   tell me what will work best because I just want to enjoy college. PROPNAME just flushed   the toilet so that water is running. I wonder what is wrong with her. She's been so   upset the last few days and it's weird that she doesn't stay here some nights. I think   it's boyfriend problems, but she won't say. And I think it's weird that PROPNAME was over   here when I walked in last night. If I were PROPNAME I think that would weird me out, but   I guess I shouldn't worry about that. He seems nice though.  I miss everyone so   much. I love PROPNAME and my KD girls, but life just isn't the same. I don't want to be   home, but I want all my friends to be here with me. No one understands me liike   they do and I miss all the closeness that we had together. I especially wish jennifer   and PROPNAME were here. I need to be harassed by PROPNAME in her caring funny way   and I need PROPNAME's crazy overexcited   guess what   every now and then. I hope   PROPNAME is doing well. She's probably in LOCNAME right now. The T. V. is on in the   next room and I hear a motorcycle outside. I hate those things so much. They are   so dangerous. I can't decide what to do tonight. I want to go out and meet guys, but   I really shouldn't. I hope that PROPNAME guy doesn't call this weekend. He's the biggest   player. Oh I wonder if I have OU tickets yet. I can't believe they're only giving out   0,000. I really need to get to class. I feel guilty after all the september 00th stuff   yesterday and not going to the candlelight ceremony, but I just get so depressed   after seeing it over and over and then not being with the same people I was at this   time last year makes me sad. I miss everyone so much, but now I need to go to   class. 
__label__label1      I wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean. What can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes. I'm not a very good typist for one. None too good at spelling either. I hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes. This computer screne is far too birght. i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this. I wish i could read some other students writtings. Maybe i'd find some insight to how i'm doing in this rat race. Maybe i'd figure out what the girls around here are looking for. how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it. I wish i were at the lake right now. no books, no tv, no phone, just a hamock and a cold drink. Maybe a seadoo. A little bit of water sports never hurt anyone. Accept the ones that crash. God i hope  never see anything like that again. Why did that have to happen, all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower. All they had to do was look around for boats. They could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldn't understand that a jet ski isn't a toy. A goddamn toy! how could anyone   play   with their life like that. I hope i go in my sleep. i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now. those poor bastards. i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though. i could never live with that kind of baggage. they didn't even know where their parents were. for the love of God, what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call.   MRs smith, your daughters are dead. There was nothing we could do, i guess these things just happen.   and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek. Maybe i am ill. maybe i should get a bike. I could get around alot faster. Maybe i should just leave early, then maybe i could loose some weight. mayeb i've got it all wrong though. maybe they don't even care about that. I should loose some weight anyway. its unhealthy. Who ever reads this thinks i'm a nutcase.  Hello out there. welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind. its cold in here, but you'll get used to it. watch your step, there are some loose screws here and there. don't poke at that, i'm affraid it might fall apart. don't trip on that, its allready fallen apart. i know its messy in here but i'll get it all organized sooner or later.   i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady. I hear they are very affordable. I guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole immigration mess. maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess, or our terrorism mess. or our youth mess. or our drug mess. who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are. i'll just let trusty george W. handle it. err, imean cheany  
__label__label1      Well, my first psychology writing assignment, actually my frist real psychology assignment ever, in college. So technically this is my first assignment in the major of my choice. Stream-of-conciousness. Like weird PROPNAME stream-of-conciousness. That was weird. Hopefully my thoughts arent as weird as that character, well I can't even think of the book or the characters at the moment. So it didnt make that much of an impression upon me. I really am mad that I can't use my own computer for this assignment. Smoothies on keyboards don't make for easy using of all the keys. So here I am, in this girl across the hall from me's room, using her computer, trying to focus upon my thoughts and whatnot while people are playing loud music, opening boxes of poptarts, slapping me for writing about them in my first psychology assignment, etc. I can't work when its too loud. Of course the main problem with this whole stream-of-conciousness assignment is that now I am think about what I am thinking about. Take a minute on that one. Am I really writing what I am thinking about or what I want you, whoever is reading it, to read. Ok now to focus more. This is one of the weirdest assignments I've ever done. But I will confess, I've thought about writing a book in stream of conciousness style before. PROPNAME, PROPNAME (he wrote that way didnt he?) and PROPNAME. It can't be too hard, but to be honest when your thinking about the things your smelling and feeling and seeing, its not just whatever on the paper. ) Ahhh, the smell of poptarts wafting through the air. Definately chocolate, maybe s'more. It smells so warm, and inviting and delicious. It even makes the delicious stir-fry in Jester. i had stir fry today. The chicken was gross, the vegetables stale, almost a chore to chew it. So I did what all reasonable people would do, threw it away. Despite all the starving children throughout the world, etc. Money is going fast here. Faster than I thought, its going to be a pain to call and ask the parents for some more cash. But its not like it will be the first time, or even the last. Theres just some things in life that are expected, and one of them, is asking the 'rents for money. I hope my stream-of-conciousness writing is psuedo-interesting. I mean of course it won't be PROPNAME, but after all who is. Would I want it to be too PROPNAME? I don't think so, I would probably become more of a study in psych than a student. I wish I wouldnt have known anything about PROPNAME before this assignment, because in the back of my head, I see his dashes, random . . things, and mine isnt looking like that. Oh well. My hand is beginning to hurt a bit from typing non-stop. Oh well, in the name of science! Okay, people here are starting to talk to me while Im trying to concentrate. Talking about dust, and ORGNAME. And yes, of course when you use AC, dust increases. Its a POSITIVE correleation. People are starting to laugh at me and call me PROPNAME. All in good fun, yes I know. I'll show them. Haha. I want this girl to play PROPNAME PROPNAME, and she wont. Stubborn thing. Music, its funny to think about, there are so many kinds. Wow. I know about. 000000 songs. I think its safe to assume that. Whenever you assume, though, it makes an ass out of you and me. My old psych teacher used to spit those sayings at us during senior year. She was a little off her rocker. She worked at PROPNAME, but I think she used to be a patient there. Either way it was funny to watch her. Mrs. PROPNAME, the LOCNAME, Shivers. Wow. She was wild. Coco the Gorilla. That's all the lady would talk about. It was like CoCo was her damn gorilla or something. Haha, wow. Everything related to Coco. Funny old woman. And she would knit, all day, during class during lunch. She was odd. But who's to say whats normal? Im starting to think of this one time, when my mom told me that 0% of the world was sane. First off, that means there are a heck of a lot of crazy people running around. But then you start to think, 0%, holy mackeral, which side am I on? And then you finally realize, you arent one of those 0% whose 'normal'. Either way, its fine. I love psychology. Its bad, like cool bad, not bad bad. I worked two summers ago with a research psychologist in the VA/Baylor labs at the ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME. I saw all kinds of interesting things. Brain-slicing and the likes. This doc that I worked with, Dr. PROPNAME, was a card. I went with him to rounds. Mr. PROPNAME. The man, about 00, called me PROPNAME PROPNAME, and claimed that birds and horses around his house told him to kill the Jews, and his wife. The thing was, his wife was dead. Either way, it was interesting. There were so many like that. It was wild. Then, came the multiple personalities. Not for me, but I learned about them in psych class and read 'PROPNAME' and then I was off. I read 'When Rabbit Howls'- whoa. How interesting though! Oh no, I only have 0 minutes left, I want to keep talking about multiples. Anyway, then I read 'I Never Promised You a Rose Garden', that threw me off. She was a little weird. But hey, don't forget about that 0%, we all are. This wasnt so bad after all. I didnt really focus on things I was smelling or feeling, well kinda. Just mainly what I was thinking, which was enough for me, and I mean after all, I'm no PROPNAME, thank God. 
__label__label0      I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at LOCNAME. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 00 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 00 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of ORGNAME. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his   alone time   with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video 
__label__label1      Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that PROPNAME went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 0. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss PROPNAME and my family. Living in LOCNAME is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but PROPNAME is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in LOCNAME and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish PROPNAME was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope PROPNAME, ORGNAME and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think PROPNAME is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how PROPNAME and PROPNAME live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love ORGNAME. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope PROPNAME will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. 
__label__label0      My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 0 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. 
__label__label0      Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend PROPNAME this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to PROPNAME PROPNAME. But then his trip to PROPNAME PROPNAME got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to LOCNAME next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 00 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They will be turning 00. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now PROPNAME wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 00:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 0:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of PROPNAME or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship. But he went to ORGNAME. Also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. But he was miserable, I remember how sad he was. He used to come home every weekend. But he was in College Station, only about an hour from home. Anyways, I wouldn't even want to be like that. I don't want to seem like I can't handle things and I have to run back to PROPNAME all the time. But I really miss him and I have this lost feeling, like I'm not sure what to do with myself. My roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. She had a little package slip in the mail too. PROPNAME said that I should check my mail today and I did, but I didn't get anything, so I don't know what he's talking about. It's a very cloudy day today. I am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where I have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. So I hope it clears off later. The other problem is I can't find a place from where I can do it. At first I thought I would just go to the top of the Jester parking Garage, so I did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - I couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. So I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do about it. It is actually stressing me out, because I just don't know what to do. I hope I will figure out something this weekend. The homework is not due until Thursday. But I'd rather get it over with. My roommate just came back and said that I did have a letter from PROPNAME. That is weird because I checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. So I'm excited now. Now she is folding her laundry. I did my laundry yesterday. It is so expensive, 00 cents a load. That is why I'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.   
__label__label0      Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask PROPNAME to go with me. I also need to call PROPNAME. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 0 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 00. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask PROPNAME today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with PROPNAME PROPNAME right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and PROPNAME never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew PROPNAME PROPNAME would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and PROPNAME comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home. 
__label__label1      I just ate at PROPNAME with my dad. Why is it that I feel like crying everytime I see him but I could care less about seeing my mom?  I guess I've always been a daddy's girl. I am waiting for my roommate, she's kind of helpless. Actually shes extremely helpless. I try to be understanding but shes clueless sometimes. Like hooking her computer up, maybe since my dad works for ORGNAME I have an advantage over other computer-illiterate people but really- red cord matches with red slot, green with green, etc. I feel like I have to take her everywhere with me. For instance, the reason I am waiting on her is because I'm going to my boyfriends house and she wants to come with me. I wouldn't mind except that I don't get to see PROPNAME (boyfriend) very often and when I do she wants to come with me. I feel bad for her, I mean in that she has no car to get around and I do but still I guess I am selfish like that. I am desperate to know why I sometimes want to shot PROPNAME- part of me loves him deeply and the other part wants to shake some sense into him. I guess I should just listen to my brother when he tells me PROPNAME's not the one and I shouldn't stress over it. I know PROPNAME's not Mr. Right but he sure is Mr. Right Now and thats fun too!  He's just super inconsiderate. We went to the same high school outside of LOCNAME at LOCNAME LOCNAME, its a 00 minute drive and he NEVER comes to see me, I always have to go see him. Thats not to say he doesnt tell me hes going to come out. He always says   sure baby I'll come see you tonight   but never follows through. I don't like dating PROPNAME that much I am just paranoid of being alone I guess. (plus TA in psychology class is kind of cute. )  I HATE the singles scene. I wonder why that is, I come from a stable family environment- my parents have been happily married for 00 years yet I find myself falling so hard for every guy I date!  Its pathetic. I think that I crave positive attention. See I was always the ugly duckling in middle and early high school, then out of the blue, my junior year, guys started wanting to date me, it was a total shock to me. I guess I grew into my fat cheeks. I desperately seek someone who will tell me I'm beautiful even if I'm not the perfect blonde hair, blue eyed, tan, sorority girl. I often feel as though I was born in the wrong generation. I am so into doing things for yourself and not for others, yet I care deeply about our environment and the human race. I listen to bands who were inspired by the ORGNAME ORGNAME, and the only time I truly feel like I fit in is when I am at a Widespread Panic or String Cheese concert surrounded by a ton of free-spirits. Everyone is so loving and accepting at those events (partly because they are on so many drugs they don't know the difference but also because they were like me, they were the ones who got teased in middle school. It took me a long time to stop caring what other people think about me. I mean, I take care of myself, I bathe and everything, and I take pride in my own appearance yet I don't let anyone elses opinions guide my decisions. Wow stream of conciousness writing is hurting my fingers. If I get carpal tundral syndrome I know who to blame, pennebaker!  Eh I suppose if I was going to get it I would have gotten it a long time ago. I am stuffed. Really wonder if purging isnt so bad after all. Well I think I will save that for when I don't have stiches in my mouth. I just got my wisdom teeth removed. hurt like hell. Actually it hurt worse when they were growing in, the first week of college.  
__label__label0      my mom is so silly or mabey it is th eway I say them she just gets things wrong. But I love her and dad and sister they just anoy me. She tells me too much info and I get kind of too rude. Like the homecoming thing oh I am so glad that I got a rideI don't know If I should tell them or not. godd thing I get to see PROPNAME soon I miss him so bad I have to go to the dang chem review I am going to get so hungry take a snak.

__label__label1 Today is September 00th. It's kind of strange. Everyone is hurring to get to parades and festivities to remember this significant tragic event. Where am I?  I am in a friend's dorm doing a writing assignment for professor PROPNAME. This is kind of hard because I have no idea what else to write. September 00th is just the number one thing on many people's mind right now, since it is 0/00. I really don't know how to feel. I'm saddened of course, but a little tired of all the   ground zero   footage. It it's so sad, why do they keep airing it over and over and over and over again?  It makes me more sad to watch it. I haven't been able to watch T. V. all afternoon because of it. I don't know what else to write. I wonder how i'm going to get this stain off of my white star wars T-shirt. I was trying to unwrap a passion fruit starburst with my mouth only, and it sliped out of my mouth. Weird. My roomate and I tried to see who could unwrap it the fasted. It was sort of a tie, because neither of use could get the wrapper off. I wonder if they lit the tower up yet. It's supposed to be red, white and blue tonight. My foot kind of itches from a mosquito bite i recieved earlier today. I need to put something cold on it. I don't like PROPNAME PROPNAME too much. Her music is kind of weak. She has nice shoes though. I guess she couldn't be all that bad since millions of people mindlessly buy her records and posters like my friend who has it religiously taged up on his wall. He, like every other teenage boy ranging from the ages 00-00 adores her. She's not that bad. Oh man, I've only been typing for nine minutes and 00 seconds and I can't think of anything else to write. This is the longest 00 minutes of my life. We used to free write like this in a rhetoric class I was taking at my highschool. I was taking it for dual credit with a local university. We used to write for 00 minutes strait without stopping. My teacher was a nice 00 year old woman who sounded like a 00 year old. Her voice was so soothing, sometimes. I hear this whisling or hissing sound coming from the bathroom down the hall and a couple of guys laughing outside the door. I can't stop writing. Let's see, what to write about. I think I'll write about my day. Today I was late for Chemistry. again. Our teacher is this French woman who has the thickest accent. She's sweet though. After that I headed back to Jester West to grab a Freshen's smoothie. I got strawberry shooter. It was pretty good. A little icy. This guy behind me asked what i recomended, and I said the pina colider or the the passion fruit. I like passion fruit, but not as much as I like pineapple. I didn't really enjoy the strawberry shooter because it had to many seeds in it. After that i headed to my History of Rock and Roll class. I love that class. All we do really is read and listen to blues, jazz and Tin Pan Alley music. It's really fun. I came home at about 0:00 from class and fell right asleep, them watched queen of the damned. That movie has a good sound track to it. Some of the songs that were in the movie were not in the sound track. That was weird. Wow,only three minutes to go. It kind of seemed interminable at the beginning, but now it's not that hard. I guess it's easier to just think rather than to think about what you're thinking. What is that called?  Oh, yeah. metacognition. I learned that in my rhetoric class also. THinking about your thinking. Only 00seconds left. I guess I'll write my name for the remaining time. Wait there is no time.      
__label__label1      ok im sitting on my bed. i kind of wish i was at home on my bed. i like my new room a lot, and i like my new bed a lot but i miss home. i am not sad here but i just miss my old way of life and my old setting. i wish i could go back to elementary school. those were the good old days. i love my old neighborhood. i definitely want to send my kids to my elementary school. i miss the scots football games the most. i have been going to them since 0th grade, maybe? i love the atmosphere. everyone is happy and excited it is friday and you get to talk to everyone and its so fun! i like watching my friends play football and the feeling after we won. after i made belles, the scots games became even more fun. i can't explain that feeling, waiting to line up and dance on the field. you are so nervous and anxious and shaking. then the lieutenants bow and you scream for them and then the music starts. we strut out and its such an out-of-body experience. you are standing before thousands of people, and you are smiling so big and bright. not because you have to, but because you want to and you can't help it. i don't think its possible to not smile. then you get ready to dance. and you start dancing and its the best feeling in the world. you feel so weird. and you don't want to mess up. and when the music stops you are so proud. of yourself and of your team. and you stand up and strut out towards the crowd and all the fans are standing and cheering and clapping and smiling and you can't help but smile too. because all the parents are truly amazed. and all the little girls, the little girls that you used to be, are staring at you in awe. they want to be you so badly. because everyone in the community looks up to you. and you represent so much positive energy in the community. and the little boys want your autograph. and they want to date you when they're in high school. you feel like a celebrity. its your moment to shine. your fifteen minutes of fame. its ineffable. i can't describe the feeling, but its the best. i miss those days so much. i would give anything to go back to that. but i cant, and thats what kills me. i can't wait to go back to the scots game in a few weeks. it will be so weird to see my younger friends dancing. to my favorite dance ever. to my first dance on the field. it was the best dance anyone had seen. and the sad thing is, i won't be a part of it. it will be one of those bittersweet moments. i love those moments. i live for those moments. they make you so happy and so sad at the same time. it makes me so happy to reminisce in my favorite days. i don't know how i will feel when i go back to that stadium because it will be so different. most of my friends will be gone. i like my new lifestyle in college. its fine. but i loved what i had. i don't like getting older. im fine with where i was. i feel like my life is going by so fast. i feel like my best days are behind me. i can't believe how fast high school went by. if i could, i would go back and do it all over again. exactly the same way. i would make the same mistakes and everything. just to relive those incredible four years. they werent always fun, but it was a good experience. instead of reliving them, i would like to just watch it all on video. watch everything I've ever done. i miss camp too. i learned everything about life at camp. it makes me so sad to think im not a camper anymore. thats how i know im old. thats how i know my life is going by so fast. camp is pure happiness. all of my favorite things in life are behind me and i don't know what to do about it. i am really enjoying school here. like the classes itself are so interesting and im really enjoying them. but the work is becoming overwhelming. and i don't like   going out   at night. i don't like socializing with superficial people. i feel surrounded by sin. by people who only care about being cool or something. i just love the days when everyone was innocent. and it didnt matter what you did on the weekend. it didnt matter who your friends were as long as you were happy with them. everyone was nice. and on friday nights we would eat dinner at jacks and then go to the scots game. when everything was perfect. and you didnt worry about anything. seriously, stress wasnt an issue. school work was nothing because it was so easy. everything was done for you. you went to soccer practice and you went to school. that was it. it was so simple. did i realize that then? did i thoroughly enjoy it while i was there? or do i just love it looking back on it? i don't know why i like living in the past. but i enjoy dwelling in it. it makes me happy and sad at the same time. my best friend is the same way. she is the best person i know. i don't know how i will survive the next four years without her physically by my side everyday. she is the only person that fully understands me because she is me. she feels the same way. and how many times have we talked about these good old days? the elementary school that we loved so much and the scots games that were the highlight of our weekend. every chance we got. and i could do it again and again with her. even if we repeated the same words. just as long as i got to relive it for those few minutes. i can't believe life in my community is going on without me. i know my home is much quieter now. and i know my mom is longing for the days she walked me to elementary school, probably as much as i am. i wonder if when i leave college in four years ill be longing to go back to the beginning. should i be spending these moments living in the excitement because soon these will be the good old days? i can't see how they are. i like my dorm a lot. i can smell all these flowers. i can't believe im a pi phi. thats how i know im old. if i had chosen anything else, i would be denying my past. my mom is a part of me so thats why i chose what i chose. i have been waiting to be a pi phi for as long as i can remember. only i assumed i would be at smu. did i choose the right school? i didnt really choose because i wasnt ready to go and i don't think im ready to be here 
__label__label1      As soon as I am done with this I plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. I don't really feel much like working. My biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. My telephone just rang. My air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that I have heard. Right now I am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. We ate at ORGNAME's and the food was salty. I wish I was in a cold swimming pool right now. This weekend was fun. We went swimming in the lake. College is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. I dont' miss them terribly, but I just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. Classes have not been that hard these first several days, and I am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. Now I seem to have nothing on my mind. I am just staring at the computer screen. All I really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. My neck is still a little sore. I will take some aspirin later. I will check my mailbox later today. My bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. Now I am not really thinking of much. I feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before I head out of my room. In fact, right when I am finished writing this I am going to lay on my bed. I am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. Only about 00 days until Christmas break. 
__label__label1 Am not in the best of moods right now. I have something bothering me at this time. But I take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. I am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside.  However, life goes on. Am good now, or at least not feeling so down. This is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. Sounds really bad, but I console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others.   AT this very moment Am listening to music while typing. I really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. And it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. If you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. I always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow.   I decided to do my assignment now, because I was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time I will have. So if I don't do it now, I`ll probably not have sufficient time.   Guess what! Life in college is very stressing, so I always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. I always thought that I was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. But hey, life must go on, so I am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress.   I like my life right now, I really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, I know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what I am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life.    I don`t type that very well, so there will be I hope not too many errors. Life is one of the best things we have. We can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a GOOD impact.     
__label__label1 This seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. I wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if I should capitalize my letters. Normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. I can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. Then there's the side of me that is analytical, am I typing too much? Why am I talking to myself? Damn a minute is a long time? There are always questions. I've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. I believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). I have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. The breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. It is also amusing that I, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. My room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; I already sleep too much. You would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. I feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. What happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? I think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 00 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. It's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. That's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. There is alot of dissapointment in the senses. Our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. I also wonder what this expiriment is for. What is it that you are trying to get out of me? My age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium?  That's a funny thing to say. My mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing.  Is it ok if i pause a few times. It's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. I watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something I now can relate to. It's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). I only wish I never do that to anyone, for I know how it feels and it is from that that I do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 00 minutes or can you finish your sentence. I guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.    
__label__label1      I was thinking about college and all the stuff that comes with it. college will be so hard yet so easy, i wonder how i will control myself. i don't want the fun factor to totally overrule the work factor. but then again, the classes seem pretty fun and not so hard. yet again, it has also only been a week of classes, so i could be sorely mistaken. we will just have to see what happens as time unfolds. i'm also a little worried because i have a boyfriend that goes to stephen f. austin state university, and driving distance that is 0 and 0/0 hours away!! how will i manage this?? we have been together for over a year and a half, so i can't just throw the relationship away, he means a lot to me. what do i do?? i guess i will give it time and see what happens. college is a lot to handle, and managing it all with a long-distance boyfriend is not easy. i don't know what i'm getting myself into. i'm also really pissed that i decided to stay at dobie, because after visiting friends in towers today i realized how much better it is, and what i rip off dobie is. the food sucks!! it drives me insane how bad it is and what a rip off everything is. towers is way better. i'm just glad that i'm rooming with my great friend PROPNAME in a badass apartment next year. yay!! we'll have our own rooms and all we'll have to do is take a short bus trip to campus every day. not that bad. plus we'll be more familiar with campus and won't get so lost, as i do here constantly. but it is my first year after all, so it can't be that bad. i'm also kind of nervous about my freshman seminar class, it sounds so ridiculously hard! a lot of writing and sharing your   feelings,   and all that stuff. i had to read like 00 pages just on how to   listen   correctly to other people. i'm 00 years old! i know how to listen! this is not kindergarten. it just makes me so mad. i'm really glad i met my friend shara, i knew her slightly my senior year in high school so we come from the same background and have a lot to relate to. i've gotten to know her so well these past 0 weeks that i feel like i've known her all my life! she's such a great girl. i like how she does not hesitate to compliment her friends for ANYTHING. great character trait to have. and i'm glad about all the parties that are here in austin, and the unique culture. walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though, but i'll never walk by myself anyway so it's all good. and i love the music scene. i'm afraid i'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown. i'm obsessed with spongebob! i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room, and i have spongebob band-aids. he's so cute! and the show is hilarious, totally my type of humor. i have the dvd as well, is that scary or what?? and you know what makes me mad? i got a heat rash here a few days after i moved in! that sucks! why here of all places? i think houston is MUCH hotter just because of the huge humidity factor. but NO i get a heat rash here. sucks. at least it's not visible, it's only little bumps you can barely feel. AND i got a popped blood vessel in MY EYE. what more could possibly go wrong? i guess a lot but it's so much to handle right when i get there! makes me so self conscious! i guess that's a psychology topic--why people get self-conscious. interesting topic. i would like to talk about it sometime in class. i think when i'm done with this i will do some physics problems and then just watch zoolander on dvd or something. yay. i'm so glad i have a tv, vcr, and dvd player! my room is totally pimped out, how great is that. i feel so exhausted. walking isn't easy in this heat, no matter what time of the day it is. i'm actually getting really hungry. i might fix myself a peanut butter sandwich. crunchy, but of course, what else? crunchy is the way to go. should i feel guilty about making plans to go to a party on a thursday night? is that bad? i don't really think so, seeing as on fridays i have only one 0 hour class from 00-0. wow that was a lot of 0s. god i'm so hungry, is this thing over yet? my hands are shaking. need food. aagh. peanut. butter. crunchy. does it matter if i'm coherent or not? it's just that when i get hungry, WHAM it hits me like a train and i get all hungry and can't help it. oh well. i hope this thing was entertaining for you, or whoever is reading this thing. i'm glad i got this over with early. yay im done. 
__label__label0  It is a rainy  grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around   my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer   has broken. I tell you what there is always something. more money   more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so   strange and makes me feel like  I'm walking on a tight rope. I hate   the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes   the money chase. I will be getting back to work very soon. Its been a   strange summer hit over and over.   It feels so good to see PROPNAME out of his brace!Man he took that whole   thing well. I think we both took it very well. Its hard to see someone   you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around   someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a   nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! I would have been a   emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 0 months   pretty well. Free again,yes!   my house always seems to become a mess, I just cleaned a day   ago.  It's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. I never seem to   keep up with a journal  I only write in them when I'm sad or   depressed. What a shame i could learn so much about myself . my   grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 0 pages   a day. Speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such   an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 0 letters from   her and still have not  written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! Less   talking more doing. That is so like me, I'm working on it but I love to   talk about the things I need / want to do instead of just going for it. like   working-out its silly . Ok I am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out. 
__label__label1 Does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? This whole electronic assignment is very new to me and I have no clue what i should do! I'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. As I'm typing, my fingers are shaking. The whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! College is a completely different world and I honestly don't know how well i will do! Do i have to capitalize my   I's  ? I type much faster if I don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. This 00 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 0 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in AP Language. PROPNAME made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely WRONG! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think,   what am i supposed to do now?   i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. Britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ? 
__label__label0      Hey, well, I am really very nervous, writing down all of my thoughts and feelings on this computer and not in my own personal journal. Because, atleast there I know I will be the only one reading it. But I guess I 'll start writing about what I really have on my mind. My boyfriend and best friend just took off on a long truck ride back home, which is about six and half hours away. They (PROPNAME and PROPNAME) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes I miss them like crazy! PROPNAME means everything to me and I can't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away. But then again I decided to come to LOCNAME and not to Tech. Right? Well, that is one thing that is bothering me, the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother, who is only four years older than me, is causing some major problems back at home. And on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as I left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything. I feel really helpless because I am over here in LOCNAME and I can't help my sister or my dad go through their problems. I usually stuck up for them when I was home and now I just get to hear about them over the telephone. Which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story. I know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister I'm worried about. PROPNAME, my step mom is such a pain. She is very very, immature for her age and I saw this coming the whole time. I just wish my dad did so he doesn't have to be going thru this right now. I really miss home. I even miss my dog, Homie. I bet he feels like I abandoned him. I was the only one who paid attention to him, but I hope PROPNAME is taking good care of him now. I've only been in school for two weeks and it feels like it should already be november. Sounds pathetic, right? I'm wondering if this was the right decision. I sure hope so. I am a firm believer that God will never give me something that I could not handle by myself. So I just have to take this with a grain of salt and leave it at that. I just wish it was as easy as that. Gosh now it has been one hour and twenty minutes since PROPNAME has left. I keep looking at the clock like he is fixing to get here instead of him being on his way back home. We have become closer ever since I moved. It seems weird saying that but I really mean it. We actually have conversations on the phone, we talk on the internet, and when we see each other it feels like it did when we first started going out, four years ago! It feels great. I love him and I can honestly say that I will marry him one day. Heck, I'd marry him tomorrow if he asked me. He is my best friend and I can tell him anything. He is smart and funny and really good looking. Better yet, he is perfect. He has never cheated on me and always makes me feel like a queen. Sometimes I'm not sure if I deserve him. But I do love him and I always will. It still feels like I'm writing in my diary, although if I was I wouldn't be as consious about typos and mispelled words! I really like this assignment though, it sure beats the chemistry homework I really should be doing right now. I hate chemistry. I hate homework! But it has to be done, right? I often wonder what would happen if I just said to heck with it all and quit. My family would freak. They are so by the book. If anyone was to go out of the norm their whole world collapse. I hope I'm not like that to my kids. I want to be different. I want to make a difference not wait for someone to do it and then say hey I helped them get there. I want to be the one to do something, something special. I just figure out what. I just know that whatever it is PROPNAME is there with me when I do it. You know what? Its hard to type when your nose is running! But I'm almost out of time so I'll keep on typing. I can do it, I can do it! Ha, ha thats kind of funny. Speaking of funny isnt if funny how when your onthe internet you mispell words on purpose and here I am trying really hard not to misspell anything, even when it doesn't matter if the words are mispelled or not. That is bizarre. Remember that song   How Bizarre   I hated it but PROPNAME always sang it and it drove me crazy. Thats funny 
__label__label1      I'm cold right now. I should get a blanket. I miss my boyfriend. I wonder if he's at work right now. It's 00:00 there. Someone's being loud in the hall. Maybe it's those weird girls that PROPNAME and I had to   look at   last night. They wouldn't stop chittering!  And it was almost 0 o'clock in the morning!  I had to wake up this morning at 0, but I didn't get up until 0:00. I hate waking up early. My eyes are all sleepy, and I couldn't keep them open in Spanish!  I love my Spanish class. Prof. PROPNAME is quite interesting. Oooh!  The 0nd season of Friends is coming out soon. I should get that. But I like Prof. PROPNAME. I like his accent. This morning he told us that we (0:00 class) are going to adopt a poor hispanic family in December for Christmas. What a good idea. I need to go and find a service organization to join. I think a sorority would be fun, too, but I don't feel like paying for my friends. My friend PROPNAME took out a loan for her sorority at ORGNAME. Silly girl. But it's typical of her. Yesterday was my birthday. I don't like being at school for birthdays, I've decided. You don't get as much attention here as at home. I felt kind of lost, in fact. My roomie brought me flowers, though. And mom sent 00 million presents. But it's not the same as being there. I don't want to go home, though. I like being away from home. I just miss my cat, though. I like having something warm and furry to come interrupt my homework. He's so cute!  I also miss my dad. Poor dad. Mom's going to drive him crazy. PROPNAME told me that he's going to start kayaking more often. Mom needs to get out more. All she does is sit at home, read, and worry about me. Definitely a disadvantage to be an only child. But I did have a pretty good child hood. I had enough friends. Too many, sometimes. I really like that PROPNAME character on PROPNAME. He reminds me of PROPNAME. Only, PROPNAME's not mentally ill. I would hate to have to wake up as early as PROPNAME does every day. Four-thirty in the morning is insane!  Silly ORGNAMEs. what do they possibly get done that early in the morning?  Don't they realize that the majority of their troops are ages 00-00?  I've heard that people in that age group, and then teenagers as well, are prone to stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning. Makes sense to me. I would do it every day if I could. I like staying up late (when I have the energy). For some reason I feel like I can get more done at night. Like cleaning/organizing my room, for example. Why would I want to do that at night when I'm just as capable of doing it in the morning?  That doesn't make any sense. I need to change the song on the stereo. I'm not in a very UB00 place. Righteous Brothers are good. But this song reminds me of PROPNAME again. I hope that the Marine ORGNAME Birthday Ball goes well in November. I'm really nervous. What should I wear?  Good grief, I never thought that I'd type that kind of question. How flaky. But I am still wondering what to wear. Would a gown work?  And what color?  This isn't like a school dance or anything. This is a real thing, where Marines and their wives/girlfriends are there. Older people, I mean. I always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. I feel like they're all wondering,   what is she doing with him?   or   she's way too young to be here.   My hands are beginnning to ache. I keep backspacing my mistakes. Perfectionist. That's me. I wonder if I really am one. Maybe not. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I should look at her schedule. if I can find it, I mean. My feet are cold. How do I keep that from happening?  And why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's?  Is it some sort of evolutionary thing?  Or just another one of those differences?  I miss my friends. Maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. But I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. And PROPNAME. I couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. My mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. Whatever. She could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. I don't get it. Sometimes I feel like she's the best friend ever. But then other times (*most times) I feel like I'm being left behind again. Why do I get left out?  I think I'd like me if I were someone else. Even when I'm with PROPNAME, or PROPNAME, when we're in a group, I'm not the popular one. I really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.  
__label__label1      I am wondering how I am going to type because I do not type very well. I also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write/type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know?   today was the yr anniv of 0/00, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 00 as 0-0-0. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there.    i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her  we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves)  like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!!   i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing.  i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it?  i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so I always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i?   well i have about 0 min left, it wasn't that painful   i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 00 mins went by really quickly 00, 0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0 yea!!!!!  its over!  not bad, eh?  enjoy   
__label__label0  Today is thursday, September 00th. Yesterday was 0/00. I wasn't too scared about it cause I knew that nothing would happen. It was just kind of sad, I guess. Everytime I turned on the T. V. there was something about it. The sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. By the end of the day, I was just kind of fed up with it. There was this one part that certaintly got my attention. On ORGNAME, they were having this 00 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 0/00. THere was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an Afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. I think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an Muslim, he was a Shikh or something. I mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire Muslim society. I mean there are 0 billion Muslims, they can't all be terrorists. But I don't really blame them, cause I mean even if I was in their places, I would kind of react the same way. Although, I would try not to. But, now things are changing. Not many people hate you just because one is a Muslim. Oh well, enough about this.   I saw this cute chick on 0/00. She was in the biology class. She was just sooo  cute. I should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. Hopefully, i will see her next time.          Today was the draw for the texas-ou game. I didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 00000s, and the tickets were sold out at 00000. This kind of . . I mean only 000 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. I was really disappointed. But i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years.          I am going home this weekend, first time after school started. I am really looking forward to it. Just need a few days away from ORGNAME. Its seems like I have been here more than 0 weeks. It should be fun.        I also have test coming up starting next week. Hopefully i will do good. I really need to make as many As as i can. I have to transfer to the school of Business, which is the hardest to get into. Hopefully, i will get in.          After i get done with this, i have to finish my Calculus homework. Its due tomm at 0 in the morning. What kind of time is that. Last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 0 in the afternoon. I didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. I was done with it too. I was sooooooo mad. I guess i learned my lesson though. BUt still, 0 in the morning, whats up with the time.          I had a quiz in Economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. Last week's quiz was a piece of cake. IT was sooo easy. I hate when teacher/sorry professors do this. THey make the first test/quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. Be consistent, you know.         I have 0 minutes left, ummm,  This class is kind of fun. I like Dr. PROPNAME, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. But my Economics professor is just as cool, Dr. PROPNAME. Both of the class are fun. Cal and CHemistry are alright, not as much fun.        It is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. LOCNAME is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. I guess i am getting used to it though. Well my time is up. It was fun writing this. Its kind of girly though, like a journal.     
__label__label1 Oh no!  I wasn't ready!  Oh well!  This seems weird to me to write what I think. I think very random things. I really like school here but miss my family. My roommate is going out tonight and she looks cute. It is some kind of formal for a frat. I don't like the frats here. The boys make me feel uncomfortable. A lot of guys do that though. They don't seem to notice me in any way. It is kind of weird. All this time I thought it would be better once I got to college and the guys would notice me, but nothing has really changed. They all still see me as a cute friend girl. But I am beginning to accept and like that. I am beginning to kind of like being   one of the guys  !  Oh poot! I forgot to put an away message on my Instant Messenger. I hope no one IMs me. Maybe I should do that. It will only take a sec. Okay!  Done!  It feels like time is passing so slowly as I type. Maybe it is because I want this to be over with. I feel like I type a lot slower than I thought. At least I use all my fingers and not just my pointers. I feel sorry for the people that do that. If I were to keep thinking in this way, will whoever reads this think I am a huge loser?  Am I a loser anyway for doing this assignment almost 0 weeks before it is due?  Wait, I think it is two weeks and one day away from being due. Or 0 weeks and 0 days!  I think. Maybe I don't even know the due date and am just getting ahead. I think that is right. I just scratched the scab on my arm and it hurt. I don't know how it got there. I feel like such a little kid!  I fall all the time and have bruises all over my arms and legs and scabs on my elbows and knees. I am such a clutz!  I need to adjust my screen because it is getting hard for me to see what I am writing. I hope I am not misspelling any words. I am not the best speller, and when I am typing it gets worse. I always spell because-   BECASUE  . It is terrible. I think people rely on computers too much to fix their mistakes for them. We now even can talk on the phone through the internet and stuff. That can help us fix relationship problems. My roommate is putting lotion on. She makes me laugh a lot!  Actually it isn't hard to do. But the funniest person is my brother in law PROPNAME. He is so hilarious. All he has to do is say one word and I will bust out laughing. I wish that I could be that funny. Laughing makes people feel good!  My cousin used to say that it makes you live longer to laugh. I wonder if she is right. She laughs even more than me!  My roommate just sneezed and I laughed because she did!  See!  I just had to go back and fix because, because I spelled it wrong!  Anyway!  Back to my cousin. She has become my best friend. (or at least one of them)  I miss her a lot. LOCNAME and LOCNAME are far from each other and since she is only 00 it is hard for her to be allowed to come down here without her parents throwing a fit. They probably are worried about me. I sent them an email today because my aunt is a teacher at ORGNAME's SUmmit, and she used to teach at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I met a guy that had her as a teacher. He goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. That is only 00 minutes away!  I am developing feelings for him. I went out with 00 boys on Friday, and I was the only girl. PROPNAME, the boy, was there too, and we hung out a lot of the time. He is really a great guy. I want to get to know him better. I saw him last night at our friend's house that introduced us, and he barely talked to me. I tryed to talk to him, and he was, I think, trying to talk to me, but this girl named PROPNAME kept interfering. She goes to ORGNAME and came down for the weekend to see all her   best friends  . Whatever. She kept keeping him from talking to me. He told me to follow him around at one part. He made me laugh a lot. I really like it when guys make me laugh. Another thing is that he makes me feel comfortable around him, like I have known him for a long time. That is another thing I look for in guys. Being comfortable and laughing is a good combination of things to be. It makes me happy. My roommate is talking to her sister right now, and it makes me miss my sisters. They are both older than me and I miss them. I actually hung out with them all day today, so I don't know why I miss them. I love them a whole lot. It is amazing how when we grow up, we all become closer even though we are 0 and 0 years apart. I guess growing up makes everything between my family better!  PROPNAME PROPNAME is not cute and PROPNAME is crushing on him and she made fun of me. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such a liar and a big jerk. I don't know what made me think I would have fun with him. HELLO!!  Differing personalities TOTALLY!!  I like musicals, for instance, and he doesn't know a thing about them. I want to be an actress one day, speaking of musicals, and I would love to do a show on LOCNAME!  I want to go to LOCNAME, though, first. That would be awesome to make a movie. PROPNAME and her sister are even getting closer like my sisters are. WOAH!  That was totally off subject. I think it is because I am now writing this and listening to PROPNAME talk. That is hard to do. Kind of like listening to music and studying. It is hard. TIME UP! 
__label__label1      Stream of Conciousness. hmmm. My mind is clearest when it's late, music in the background is soothing, it makes me think of PROPNAME. The music playing is PROPNAME's favorite. It's amazing that one person can be such a pillar of strength. One person can change so much, by doing so little. Strength, Independance, Perserverance, Beauty, ORGNAME, Love, ORGNAME, these are things that everyone wants, we all want to be everything, and the best of it all. Not even that we want to be everything, but we want to be precieved as everything. People in high school who were everything were really nothing. In life people who think they're everything are usually nothing. I want to be something. I feel really small, i'm waiting to feel big. Not physcially, but emotionally, big. I'm not fragile, but I'm not that pilar of strength yet. this isn't home yet. My bed isn't home yet. With time it will be home. When I walk in the door it feels like home, but every morning when i wake up, it's not quite right. It gets more right every day. Dashboard Confessionals, listening to them makes me feel comfortable, just quiet enough to hear, but not load enough to understand. So much to do, lists and lists. Why is it I procrastine always, always. Study habits are so bad, mom was right. I hate it when mom is right. Why do I always yell at her in my dreams? Dreams are always there, emotions are always there, I can't hide them in dreams. Rain is wonderful, it makes me breathe lighter. I love sleeping when its raining on the window, that was nice today. Sitting on my bed letting the skys fall. This life isn't a dress rehearsal, that is a poster on my wall. I'm never going to get a second chance, this is all i've got, never again will this moment happen, and look, i'm spending this moment typing like a crazy person trying to fill up this twenty minutes. I never realized how long twenty minutes can really be. The sound of the shower is a lot like the sound of rain, i like it. I like the smell of our room after someone is done showering, it's clean, fresh, it makes me smile. why are pictures so important? I have every important thing captured into pictures, who cares if you're really happy, when the camera comes, the smile appears, wheater you want it to or not. It's like when I dance, you walk on the stage and I become a totally different person, its not me. Dance is wonderfully curel. Twisting, torking, pain, stretching, then you walk on the stage and slap on a smile, like it feels good, pretending or lying? hmmmm. . something to ponder. My biology book keeps staring at me, screaming YOU HAVE TO READ ME SOMETIME! and God, is it right, i've got to. Dedication, it's what got me here, and it's the only thing that's going to get me out within the next four to five years. Biology - how could that motivate anyone?!?! The only thing that motivates me is dance, sad, but true. What would i be doing without dance? Living on the street corners of LOCNAME? I would if it made me happy - poor, rich, whatever, happy. Happy is what i want. 00 minutes is up - stream of conciousness. . hmmmm. . 
__label__label0 I don't know what I'm doing tonight. There's a PROPNAME PROPNAME concert at the Midnight Rodeo place on PROPNAME PROPNAME. I have no idea how I would get there. Maybe I could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. I was just looking online and saw that some OU/UT tickets are going for like $0000. I don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. I just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the OU/UT game. Pretty cool. Ya, PROPNAME's getting upset at me cause I'm not going to ORGNAME ORGNAME this weekend. Instead, I'm going to go see PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in LOCNAME on Saturday. God, I hate this LOCNAME country thing. I got to change the radio station. It's upsetting. I wonder where my roomate LOCNAME is. He was supposed to be back around 0:00 and he still hasn't showed up. Oh well. I got all of my calculus homework except for like 0 problems done, so that's pretty cool. I wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. I want to go play soccer tonight at LOCNAME LOCNAME, but they're like watching American Pie 0 tonight. That's really cool. Oh well. Haha, it's only been four minutes? This is going to take forever. I can't wait to go back to PROPNAME PROPNAME for homecoming. I want to go to the alumni party before the game. Supposedly, it's pretty fun. They don't really mind at all if you're underage. Haha. My leg is hurting because I'm pressing it up against the table while i write. What other homework do I have to do tonight? Hm. . . Oh, I have to print out some Spanish worksheets. My computer keeps humming at odd intervals. I wonder what's going on there. I can't find a decent radio station that I can recieve in my dorm. I'm going to put some music from ORGNAME on. Haha, just kidding. PROPNAME PROPNAME- It's a Great Day to be Alive just came on. Haha. I hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because I'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. This song reminds me of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was a blast. They have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. It's awesome. My buddies and I met all these cute girls from LOCNAME, or something like that. All I know is that I want to go to LOCNAME sometime! haha. My bed isn't too comfy. It could be a lot nicer. I need to fix that somehow. Great, this song is ending. I wonder what's next. Haha, a little ORGNAME is next. You ever listened to   Me and Billy the Kid   by PROPNAME PROPNAME? Let me tell ya, it's a good song. I wish I could play the fiddle that well. I need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . That'd be cool. I suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. Only halfway done. I wonder how much people write in these things. I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 00 by PROPNAME PROPNAME. It talks about coming back to LOCNAME when he's leaving in LOCNAME. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with PROPNAME. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention LOCNAME in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when PROPNAME goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 00!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little LOCNAME LOCNAME, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A ORGNAME ORGNAME guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun. Adios till next time. 
__label__label0      Today is a very stressful day, I just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when I don't understand something perfectly I get really frusterated. My boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. Why can't he just let me do what I want? I'm kind of homesick lately. People know all their friends from high school and I'm just alone from LOCNAME, besides PROPNAME who is not being very nice lately. Well actually it's me not being very nice. It's really weird because my friends and I all have birthdays this week. Mine's on September 00th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. It never really is. Two years ago my party got crashed by PROPNAME and then last year it was 0-00. Hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 0-00. I think it will. The fact that I have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. Oh well I think I've officially decided that I'm changing my birthday to september 00th. My friends and I are all going to Hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. I called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought I was going to drop out of school. They wanted to make sure that I had been studying. they don't realize that I am on my own now and that I can deal with my own problems myself. PROPNAME and I just found this new diet. You eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. You have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because I'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. Thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. I palyed on a soccer team today. Our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. It was a good workout because it was so hot out. It was alot of fun, I scored three goals and I broke PROPNAME' toe. OOPs! I feel kind of bad. I hate the fact that the last 0 weeks all I've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. Now I realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. I also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good GPA. I set goqals for myself today because I was reading a book at   LOCNAME and Noble and I said that I was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. Hopefully I can do that. I think I will be able to. I can't believe that PROPNAME hasn't called yet. I either thought he'd call at 00am or not at all. Oh well there's more out there. I am having a lot of fun here though, so I don't really care if we break up.   
__label__label1      well here i am, just sitting and typing. I've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - I've got class til 0, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week!  hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me?  thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 0 (or 0?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 00 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big L-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that PROPNAME (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong!  maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that I've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 0) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 0) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 0 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 0) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 0 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she HAS her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows!  im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never 
__label__label1 Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 0 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 0000 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA000, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 0 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in LOCNAME, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 00 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 00 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $00 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 0 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to ORGNAME's next football game. The one against LOCNAME LOCNAME was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when PROPNAME from LOCNAME LOCNAME is seen in LOCNAME LOCNAME, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 00 seconds left. . 0 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. 
__label__label0    How I am feeling right now is interesting. I have slept so long for the past few days. I think that it could be that I just moved here from LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. Walking all over the campus is extremely exhausting and tiring. However, this weekend I did not walk a whole lot. I have just been sleeping so much. I think that it could be that I miss my mother or family and my body could be going through some sort of physical depression. That, I have no idea about. I do feel that I am getting sick. I have had a minor soar throat the past two days, and I am upset with myself because I forgot to bring my Vitamin C chewable tablets. I really like the cherry flavored ones because they taste so much better than the orange flavored ones. I know that you can only purchase the ones that I like at SunHarvest. I am not even sure if there is a SunHarvest here in LOCNAME. I do have a large gallon of orange juice, so I will just drink a whole bunch of that until I start feeling better. Or at least until I get paid so I can buy my vitamin C pills. I just got finished taking the Pretest that is required before participating in the experiments that we students must participate in before the Thanksgiving break to receive credit for this class. I thought the test was extrememly interesting. Some of the answers I were a little sketchy. In this I mean, I was unsure if the answeres I put really reflected myself or if they were merely just answers of how I want to see myself. I have a fear of aligators. That is what I meant if I had a fear of any type of animals. I have had bad dreams about aligators, but not recently. There was one that I had and then had that same dream reoccuring the months and  even years following. Yet, I haven't had dreams of aligators in a long time. I anticipate this class, for I have always found psychology an interesting subject. Well, who wouldn't. My mother never wanted me to become a psychiatrist because she said that listening to other's people's problems all the time would make a pretty girl like me ugly. I hold my mother on such a high pedistool, that I never thought of majoring in the subject again. I am a biology major. I am still unsure if that is what I really want, or if it is something that I have been trained to want since I was a child because the field was promising. I am having problems in calculus, i really don't care for the subject in the least, but it is part of my major. I feel that if I change my major just because it has a subject that I don't care for in its curriculm, that I will quit anything, for that matter, when things start getting tuff. I feel I will be a quiter. I have never felt that way about myself before and I don't intent to ever feel that way. The class does scare me. I am terrified actually. I must keep an average of a 0. 0. This may not seem to be difficult, coming from an overall average of 0. 0 ORGNAME at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME. But then I was not on a Financial Aid Plan and I knew my parents would still pay for school even if my grades fell below a 0. 0 average. So I intend to persure my dreams with my mind focused and my thoughts secured on one thing, making an A in every class. Even though I know that it will be almost impossible in Calculus II, I am going to try my hardest and I want to make my parents happy. They have given my so much already. And to make myself happy, is to make my parents happy. I don't want to be the reason of my unhappiness. If I can't make myself happy, then who really can?  
__label__label0      i'm sitting at the pcl library, i can hear the computers humming, i'm typing kind of fast so i'm worried that people will find this annoying, because i sometimes do and sometimes when i click the mouse too fast some people get annoyed. my feet are really hurting from the bruises i think i got from the car accident on wednesday, i'm wondering if i should go to the university health center and talk to someone about it, but i don't know if i'll have time to go up there, and maybe there's nothing to worry about and bruises will fade by themselves anyway. now i'm thinking about the calculus quiz that i did yesterday, i did really bad on it. i ran out of things to say, i'm really sleepy. my uncle left today i feel bad that i didn't say goodbye but he left so early in the morning back to lebanon, i don't know how long it will be until i see him again but he wasn't as friendly as he was a year ago. i remembered last night that it was my 0 friend's birthdays, it was my brother's too and i didn't get him anything. . i really should have, i should go today, but i'm so concerned about how much money i've been spending lately, i don't work anymore and i'm running out of money i should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 00. 0, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now. i want to lay down somewhere, close my eyes. i feel like cuddling with someone. but my boyfriend won't do it, he'd just want to make out. i don't, i just want someone to hold me. suddenly i feel like crying a little bit. i don't know what's bothering me. a girl sat next to me who looks like jennifer the si instructor. those sessions are helpful. 
__label__label1    In doing this writing assignment I was unsure of what i would be writing. I am having a pretty good day and I hope that it continues to be good. Transfering to LOCNAME this semester has been a great eye opener. This is my first time to live by myself and be away from home. There seems to be so much pressure right now with school and bills. It is hard sometimes to be alone, but I was the one that begged my parents to get me an apartment to myself. I wish sometimes that I would have lived with roommates, so that I would be more familiar with the people and things around me. I like having my own space and freedom, and I'm sure I can adjust the the loneliness. I have been feeling the depression kick in during the last 0 weeks. It is hard, and my phone bill is high, but I know that this is only the beginning of my life. My goal is to get my bachelor's degree in Accounting and then have a great job offer before graduating. Life seems like a blurr sometimes, even when you think you have it all planned out. I don't know what I really want from life besides being happy. I may be greedy, but I want to make a good amount of money, so that I will not have to worry about needs. I have a lot of pressure from my Dad. I have never felt like I can please him in what I do. This is probably why I have such high goals for myself. I've got to come to the realization that I don't need to make my Dad proud of me, but instead make myself proud of me. That is a hard thing to do. I am very critical of myself and if I don't do the very best, sometimes I feel like a failure. Hopefully someday I can feel pleased with myself and my life. I'm not sure what else to write. Well, I miss my friends back home a lot. My two best friends are both far away. I can't really go seem them on the weekends now because of my part-time job. But hopefully we will keep in touch regulary. Psychology is going to be lots of fun this semester. I love the way Mr. PROPNAME teaching. It's make the classroom environment much more relaxed and fun. I hope that I can also learn more about the emotional and physical behaviors that I possess. I often worried that I am crazy, jusk kidding. But there is a point where everyone has their own bit of craziness inside them. There are times that I feel like two different people. It happens very rarely, but I can see at times the difference between how I act and who I really am. It's scary, but I think normal. I sometimes feel like I am putting on a show for others to see and approve of. I have been told that I am a very nice person, but when I see the difference I feel like I am just acting that way. I don't know exactly what I mean, and I may never understand myself. There are numerous questions that I have about life and people. I don't have to know all the answers, but to understand most of them would be meaningful to me. I came from a divorced family, and when I was young I was physically abused. I didn't know the extent of my abuse until my older sister would tell me about it. I must have blocked it all out because I can only recall the moments before and after I was hurt. Which it scares me if I may someday have it all come back to me and it may be too much to handle. When I grew older I was raised in a strict PROPNAMEian household which has an affect on who I am. I believe in God and PROPNAME Christ, but there are many questions that I can't answer. But I don't think that life is about knowing all the answers. I just want to understand them. I am just going on about whatever. I kind of feel like I shouldn't have been so personal about my life 
__label__label0      Right now I am actually thinking that I am not sure exactly what I am going to write about during this twenty minutes. I was actually feeling a little nervous before clicking the button to start this assignment but now I am just thinking about what I am going to write. I just thought that if I think about something that I normally would not want someone esle to know, should I write it here. I still stuck on what to write. I just decided to think about what I have to do today and that will give me something to write about. First I have to finish this assigment, then I have to sign up for testing and hopefully finish the pre-testing before the deadline. Then I am going to make an outline for the first three chapters of my managerial accounting textbook. My train of thought was just interrupted because I started worrying about whether or not I can type fast enough to have enough written down for this assignment. Actually, I am not even sure if that matters because I am not 000% sure about how these assignments are graded. I heard Professor PROPNAME say that all we have to do is turn them in on time and we get full credit as long as we take them seriously. So that should free me up to just write. I think I might stress to much about grades. Good Lord, I am thinking that this writing assignment is not going as I pictured it. I feel a little awkward about what I just wrote. I am thinking write now about what to write next. I am thinking that I want these next seven minutes to go by quickly. I'm feeling stressed about all of the school work and outside work i have to do. I am wondering how I am going to get all of it done and when I will have time to relax or if I will have time to relax. I am now thinking that this 0st writing assignment is not going so well. I am now thinking that I wish my phone would stop ringing because it is interrupting my writing. Iam still thinking that I worry too much though. I wish I didn't. I feel like I could of done better on this writing or that I had a done it another time it might have been more up beat. The time is up. I hope this is o. k. 
__label__label0 I'm not really sure what to write. What are they going to be looking for when they read this Oh well it's easier that having to write normal paper I have so much to do this weekend. There are way to many classes that I have to study for This semester is going to be so stressful. What am I going to wear tonight?  I need go through my closet after this. I also need to call PROPNAME. I hope I get my application soon so I can start working on it. I really hope I get in. I not sure what to think about. I wonder who's going to be reading this. I guess I'll start my biology homework after this. I hate that class and nutrition. I hope I get better classes next semester. I wonder if PROPNAME is home. I need to talk to her about the game on Saturday. I hope our seats are good. This twenty minutes is going by really slow. The guy next door is blasting his music again, but at least it's not night time. I wonder it there is anything good on television. Probably not. Having cable sucks without movie channels. It's hard to think and write about at the same time. I wish I could drive home on Saturday, but I'll wait until the weekend after next. Maybe I can go to the mall this weekend. I want a new outfit for next Thursday. It will be such a relief when recruitment is over, unless I don't get in. Oh well I'll something else to do on campus if not. I have so much studying to. It's only been ten minutes?  I wish I had something to drink. I need to call so many people back. I wonder what PROPNAME will come down to see me?  Hopefully I can get us both game tickets. I need to go eat before I leave soon. I so tired of eating Cafeteria crap. I will be in an apartment again next chair. Maybe I'll eat at mall tonight. I wonder if my mom mailed me my stuff yet. I probably won't get it till Saturday or Monday. I am tired of doing this. what else can I think about? I need to finish my laundry this weekend and get change for the machines? I wonder how PROPNAME's doing? I miss dog. I need go through my calendar. My exams next week are going to kill me. This is such a waste of time. No more psychology courses for me. Maybe I can get a nap in before I leave, no have to much to do. I am so far behind. What's in my closet that I could wear tonight? I should have gone shopping last weekend but I need to stop spending so much extra money. Is somebody really going to analyze all this? Good I'm almost done. They need to turn the music down next door        
__label__label0 I am writing this for psychology class. I'm glad it accounts for part of our grade because I am nervous about the difficulty of the class, and I know this is a completion grade. I really really want an A, but I read the professors pick-a-prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be. There is so much reading, I do not know how I can keep up with it. There is a good song playing on my computer right now, Calling You" by Blue October. The class DJ should play it in our class, even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology, but it does not seem like much of his music does. Yesterday in class, when he walked up there to put on his music, I made a comment like 'oh no, here we go again', and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me. I felt kind of bad. I don't know what psychological value can be obtained from this. I find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this. Now  an Incubus song is playing, its a slower, relaxing type song called "Echo". Everytime I hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me. And for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball. I have no idea why, the song has nothing to do with volleyball. That seems to happen a lot, when I read/hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly, for no apparent reason. There was this book I read by dean koontz, I can't remember the title (I read a lot), and everytime I read it, for some reason I would play the LOCNAME CD in my head. I think its probably because the book is sort of dark/gloomy, and all of Staind's songs are depressing and miserable. I don't know why I like them. So every time I hear a staind song now, it reminds me of that book. I always picture the book cover. I remember it was a really weird book, about these creatures called from some abyss of Hell by some voodoo guy, in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and they hunt this guy and his family no matter where they go. they always get in to the buildings through the ventilation system. I can still picture them hissing and scratching at his kids. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a pretty good writer like that. he is good at making the strangest things real enough to you that you can picture them. The only thing I don't like about his books is that they are so predictable. This is how they always go: There is always a strong, independent main character, either strongly in love with their spouse or single. The main character also either encounters or owns a playful, intelligent dog. I think dean koontz really likes dogs, usually labs. The main character then comes upon some problem tat he/she can't really help but to fight, because its affecting them in some way. For example, one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him, one lady had a psychologist (haha) using hypnotism to control her and several other people, giving them bizarre fears (hers was of herself, one guy had a look-alike twin of his out to kill him. just weird stuff. So on the way of fixing the problem, the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey, or they fall even more in love with their present spouse. and it ALWAYS ends happy. Therefore I no longer read Dean PROPNAME books. I know what is going to happen after I have read the first chapter. Now a song called "I Stay Away" by PROPNAME in Chains is playing. the guy across the hall in my dorm downloaded it for me because he said my taste in music needed improving. It is good. Lets see, 0 minutes to go. Dr. PROPNAME keeps mentioning in class that we freshman should be feeling depressed/confused at this point in our lives. it seems like he is trying to make business for the mental health people that he mentioned. I personally am not overwhelmed at all by this college thing. It seems just like high school, for me at least. I was always pretty independent. didn't rely/see my parents much. And you don't really notice the big classes. I still go to bed/wake up at pretty much the same time. we do have a lot more free time here, because your life is not so structured, but I think out of habit I am structuring it myself. 00 minutes are up, goodbye. 
__label__label1 ow. I just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. I bump intot stuff a lot. I think that it's because I don't pay much attention or maybe because I'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about  the wall in front of me. I ramble a lot too and I don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. I've told the people at the management place and I don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and I'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if I don't like having the lights on?  what if I'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way I can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing I'm not like that. I don't type as well as I wish I did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. I forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, I hope it's not overdue. I already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when I told him I scratched the car?  it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when I messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and I don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if I ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when I know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because I have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. I don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and I don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. I like sharing my opinion. I even like it when people get mad or offended. I don't know why, I just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. I can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid I thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what I think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that I think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but I would never tell her that, and I certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. I think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because I only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if I can't talk to you I don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, I'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be EVIL, god forbid. God forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. I hate stupid people. I'm sorry, I'm a mean person. I don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. I hate when people ask me how I like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, I hate asking people stuff like that so I don't and I expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that I hate that. they don't know me there's no way they COULD know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. I am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. I wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do I mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. I don't think I have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then I feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. I think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up 
__label__label1 Right now I am thinking about the point of this I guess maybe it does have some point but I really don't see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment I mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes. my dorm room is rather hot and I want to get up to turn our fan on but I won't because then I would have to leave the computer and then I couldn't track my thoughts for those few second that I leave the computer. I waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 0:00 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me I also notice that I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I wonder what I'm going to be typing for 00 more minutes. gosh I have some much to do tonight I have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and I have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then I have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. I don't really like my biology class but I do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and I've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . I hope I don't have an ear infection. I feel like I'm starting to get a headache maybe its because I'm tired or maybe because I'm hungry . or maybe because I'm dehydrated. I dunno but once this is over I think I'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what I'm thinking of . I've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why I have a headache . who knows . but I can't wait till I get to  go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these I bet these can get really interesting I mean if I had to read over 000 of these I'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating?  I'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . I have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. I wish I could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 00 minutes . this is crazy . after this I have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because I know that I'll be tired and I won't feel like doing it an then I'll tell myself that I'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what I need to do but it won't happen . gosh I'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but I think it might be from my jaw and that probably why I have a headache . gosh I really could go for a massage right about now but I don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . I doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm I don't know if I like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that I will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when I close them I want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well I only have like a minute left count down . 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ah nice its over  
__label__label1 My suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. I really should go to bed so I won't be tired in the morning, but I want to get this done so I don't have to worry about it later. The tag on my shirt itches. I need to cut it off. My suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. My roommate is studying still. Someone just slammed a door down the hall. My suitemates are being loud again. My back kind of hurts. It must be from carrying my backpack around all day. I'm really tired. At least I don't have class until 00 in the morning. I'll get a little more sleep. I need to remember to go to the Co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. I bet I'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. I should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. She asked me why I had to type for twenty minutes. I've only been typing for 0 minutes! My suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. My feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. I hope I do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. I studied all my notes and read the chapters. I'm getting sleepier, but I have to finish this. They're being loud again. They are loud a lot. I think the second night I was here, they came in at 0:00 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. Me and my roommate are quiet. Someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. I think it was PROPNAME, but it may have been PROPNAME. I can't tell their voices apart yet. I think PROPNAME is the one with a job at Footlocker. My roommate is popping her knuckles. I pop mine a lot. I need to stop. Everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. I don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. I just popped my knuckles out of habit. Someone just slammed a door again. Everyone always slams doors. Maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. I only have five minutes left. That's good because I think my roommate is done studying for the evening. Now she is typing on her computer and laughing. She must be IMing someone. It is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME, or maybe it is her friend PROPNAME that I met the other day. I wonder who's online that I can talk to right now. Probably no one. I need to go to bed anyway. I'm glad I gat my Calculus homework done. I got a 00 on it, so I'm pretty happy. That's good considering I didn't get any help on it. I need to find a study group for Calculus. I probably need them for all my classes. My roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. I said yes. They do go out a lot. I don't think I've ever seen them study. My friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. I wonder how they are going to pass their classes. I'm almost done. I only have 00 more seconds. Then I get to go to bed. Good night! 
__label__label0 Today has been an absolutely great day, except for the weather. Austin has extremely crazy weather. One minute, it was bright and sunny outside, and the next it was raining cats and dogs!  Of coarse, it continued to do this for the rest of the day. Now that I am in my dorm room, I am beginning to think about what my mom and other friends are doing. It makes me a little sad to think that I am here and cannot be with them. Normally, I do not get homesick, but for the last couple of days I have been missing everyone extremely. I am sure that they are all having fun where they are, but I feel sure that they must miss me too. I just got done talking to my mom, and she said that it is very sunny down in Corpus Christi right now. I miss the excruciating sun that comes along with the cool breeze there. Now, my roommate just walked in, and I really want to go outside because she let some hot air in. It is so cold in this room. Our thermos stat is in the room across the hall from ours, and the girls in that room will not change it. They keep telling us that it is so hot in there room, but I cannot stand it. It is so cold in our room; I always walk around with a blanket. In Corpus, it is never cold, not even in the winter time. It truthfully only get down to about sixty degrees in the winter. It's crazy!  I bet my friend PROPNAME is having so much fun at LOCNAME LOCNAME She calls me every couple of days. In Corpus, we were very close, so for her not to call me that much means she is very busy and having a great time. I wonder a lot about how all my other friends are doing. Another one of my best friends just started at LOCNAME. I hope she likes it. I know her classes will be hard. I do like it here though. I am just beginning to make friends, and I think as time goes on it will get easier and easier. At least, that is what everyone tells me. I went to draw for a football wrist band today. My number was terrible. There is absolutely no way that I am going to get tickets. I wish I could have though. It would have been so much fun! I am not a big football fan, but because ORGNAME is such a big rival, it would have been exciting!  Gosh, it is so cold in here. I feel like my fingers are going to fall off. I hope the rest of the year it is not going to be like this. My roommate is now studying so I will have to be quiet for the rest of the night, but that's ok. I just go outside to talk on the phone or downstairs to watch tv. I believe that is what I will do after I finish this assignment because I really do not have much more homework to do. Actually, just kidding; I have a big economics quiz that I need to study for after I am done. Oh well another fun filled night of homework. This school is much more difficult than my high school. I miss the simplicity of high school. it wsa so much fun. Ok, my time is up so good bye. 
__label__label1 I have a ORGNAME's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder (a tribute to PROPNAME PROPNAME) and I am watching it now. My desk is a bit cluttered. purses, markers, papers with assignments that need to be done, a Dr Pepper can. I am unsure what to write. I began a painting today, and did not finish it. my dorm doesn't feel as though it's a creative environment, but I suppose the dorm won't change. so either I have to change my perspective, or not paint at all. My eyes are heavy, and I am cold, because my hair is wet and squeaky clean. My hands are warmer than usual (they are usually as cold as ice, or very near as such), and I shall have to remember to tell my mother, because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating. It is ten to midnight. My mind is active, but I lack in motivation. I am excited about this new life I have, as a college freshman, but I am also extremely nervous. I MUST do as well as possible this year, so that I won't have to return back home to a run-of-the-mill local college (as my dad has threatened if I don't succeed in producing a pretty-looking GPA), and also my future as an architect (the career which I would like to pursue) is depended solely upon my performance this year. I did not get into the architecture program this year, and should like to transfer in as a sophomore. I have run out of things to discuss. I miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home. I had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that I have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat. I brought only the bare minimum of books with me, my art books, of course, and my absolute fave novels, one of them being A Wrinkle in Time. I am fully aware that it is a young adult novel, and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite, but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless. My room smells of the body wash I use (Energizing Citrus, I LOVE it) and stale mr. gatti's pizza. there is a faint tinge of acrylic-paint smell. My roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit. My bed is full of pillows, two black hearts and a red furry one, and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me. I am, for once, not hungry. but merely satiated, as I feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger. I have less than seven minutes to go!  I wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo. In what way do you benefit from reading this?  I can't imagine how anything could come of this, except perhaps extreme boredom, or maybe resentment. There is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend's subdivision in LOCNAME, holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such, and every time we drive by her, I think: That has got to be by far the worst job in the world. She stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on, holding a bent sign and a jug of water. And I can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is: I am a pole. "  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, with one simple gesture, a stick could be stuck in the ground, and the sign pasted onto it, and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job, and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up, and it just kills me. And I am glad I am not her. I am glad I am not a whole bunch of people. The End. 
__label__label0 I am in my dorm room in jester west staring at the keyboard. my friend's dad just bought me a new dell computer because mine was so old that it would not recognize ethernet because the technology is too new. I am listening to an allman brothers band cd that I downloaded and it's pretty good. I don't know if I'm doing this right but I guess I am because I'm just typing what I'm thinking. I had to wake up at 0 this morning for a ta session for calculus which was of no help at all. she gave us the easiest problems ever and the class ran late so I had to walk into my biology class after it had started. it seems in math the teacher always explains things that are so easy and when u get to the homework u find that its nothing like class at all. I am noticing crumbs on my keyboard from the new flavor blasted goldfish extra cheddar I sampled some in the campus store and they were so good that I bought them. ok now it is getting hard to type bc I keep thinking too hard I think. I am now downloading the movie super troopers. the very first thing that I downloaded after getting my computer was the movie yellow submarine. I love having kazaa because I never have to buy cds or dvds ever again. I have an hour until my next class which just so happens to be psy. after that I think I am going shopping because my dad's wife just sent me 000 dollars for a graduation present. my sister is iming me right now. she had an away message about how mondays suck or something so I told her to think about pollyanna haha I thought it was funny. my roommate went outside to study because our room is like 00 degrees below zero at all times. I like my roommate but she is one of those overly caring people. I feel so bad saying anything mean about her though because it seems like I inconvenience her more than she does me. well maybe not I don't know. I thought that the university would match roommates according to their time schedules and interests. haha it was kind of funny because I was just assuming that my roommate was going to be a person who listened to the same kind of music that I do because that was one of the questions that you had to answer. well she does not and she only has like 0 cds and they are probably the worst ever, well maybe not but avril levine is one of them which indicates a total lack of good taste in music for her part. it always makes me wonder when people are really smart but they like dumb things like she has serendipity. I am a big john cusak fan but that movie was awful everything they said sounded so practiced and forced it was disappointing, and I probably spelled that wrong I can never remember if there are 0 s's of 0 ps and maybe there are 0 of both I don't know I guess ill look it up after I am finished with this. which I almost am I have less than one minute left woo hoo no I'm just kidding, this wasn't too bad and I got to practice my typing. I can type pretty fast but I look at the keyboard and I  
__label__label1 I hear nicole's printer printing I'm so glad she is my roommate I really like the song that's playing on the radio I wonder if my laundry is ready yet paul is a big poo face I wonder if I should tell hijm about my date with PROPNAMEh on friday it's under the table I don't think that I'm very good at this stream of consciousness thing I have to look at the keys when I type on it's kinda annoying I wonder if the professor takes off for stupid internet phrases like lol or kinda man I really can't stand paul I hope that zac doesn't turn out to be someone who's just looking to be laid this assignment seems like it'll be really easy someone just popped up on I'm I wonder if it was dylan I'm supposed to go to a concert with him on friday but zac and I were supposed to go out then I wonder what it would be like to live in austin for all your life new braunfels really sucks at some points in time right no my stomach feels kinda weird probably fro the spaghetti I ate at dinner and nicole's macaroni she htes macaroni cause she got a noodle caught in her throat one time which reminds me of the time I got a peppermint caught in my throat ooh walking on sunshine by reel big fish it reminds me of warped tour with dylan kelly and I don't remember who else went but it probably wasn't that important oh it was ronnie now it's going to be  me dylan paul patrick PROPNAME PROPNAME and james and nick all going to static x and staind in october, I'm really excited about it but kinda scared I'm walking on sunshine my feet hurt from the shoes I was wearing today I love them, they're converse sneakers so cute and they look like they would be comfortable but they're really not which is kinda disappointing rambling like this makes me feel like anne hathaway on princes diareis which makes me think of her in the other side of heaven which is one of my favorite movies nicole and I watched josie and the pussycats last week at some point in time I wonder what mark will think once I tell him that I have a date if I even bother to tell him I already told ward, I think that ward may like me but probably not and don't it feel good? I dig this song, we sang it in choir in sixth grade which brings back memories of casey and how we were the best of friends up until a stupid boy came between us I can hear the air conditioner going and the clicking of nicole's mouse she is doing a cog lab for some reason she is upset that she scored against the norm on it I think that she is really smart and am glad that she and I are roomies it was weird though cause I was in here while she and greg her boyfriend were cuddling she has a question for me but can't remember it I suppose I'll pay attention she did an experiment and has to print it out and it has to be the final name it seems like it should be daniell instead of nicole wow it's only been seven minutes and I'm running out of things to think about well if it's saved under that name um perhaps you should talk to greg about it I think she is oops I didn't realize she was on the phone I miss dancing and am kinda nervous about trying out for the roustabouts I think they're called my hair is tickling my nose I wish that I'd never had bangs to begin with it seems like such a hassle to take care of them and it's taking so long to grow them out nicole is trying to get greg to help her with her computer stuff over the phone he will probably end up coming up here and then I'll have to go down and hang out with ward and mark in my pjs to avoid  feeling awkward if nicole and greg start getting touchy feely I think that he is going to come up I'm glad that they've worked everything out now but it kinda makes me depressed because I don't really have anybody and paul is being a big poo head which is his new name poo head paul. I wonder if punctuation and capitalization and spelling count in this probably not because it's not like humans think using punctuation or caps I like the punk version of this song punk rock princes by something corporate dylan went to see them with 000 last week I wish that I hyad gone now but I haven't even started my biology questions yet and I'm afraid of failing the course and am considering dropping it my tailbone kinda hurts from sitting here so long I don't think that I want to be on AIM when paul gets back I should leave a message up on friday saying that I've gone on a date it should pose for some interesting conversation with him later on that's for sure geez 00 minutes that means that I've still got 0 to go my alarm should go off when it's been that long my laundry is probably already done I'm glad nicole showed me how because I had neglected it for so long we talked to a cool guy in there but I forgot what his name was he was a business major though I wonder  what the weather would be like tomorrow hah nicole said anal and she is talking about laura vasquez a girl from our old high school I think I saw ben campos in my psych class today but it's been so long since I've seen him and think that I keep seeing people who aren't really the people I'm thinking of so it might not have been him I really would not like to see any of them though I came up here to get away from them but oh well, c'est la vie and cool sheep tiffany laughed at that phrase earlier I just don't like beans enough to say cool beans sheep are so much better I feel like a child babbling on and on to an uncaring adult and my time is almost up so that's a good thing I think I've already been through four sogs already nicole's kinda computer illiterate though she did learn how to download stuff from her camera to computer which is more than I can probably figure out I'm thinking about my psych class now and the huge screens used to project the stuff I expected everything to be without overheads or any sort of indication on what we should write down it being all us and sucks for us if we don't know what to study for the test I really should do my biology but I'm not in the mood I keep saying that I'll do it later but honestly it won't get done I think that I say the word honestly too often and I make too many typos when I type I really like my laptop keyboard though the keys are nice and compact and make cool noises when you press them rather than nicole's chunky computer keyboard but what would you give away to have somewhere to go to I don't think that I would give up everything for just one other person though the bible says so which reminds me that I should probably e-mail my bible study instructor christie later on tonight just to let her know what is going on her kids go to school in austin jon and katie they're really cute christie and her husband got divorced a while ago and it seems like a horrible thing that they went through I don't really want to ask her about it though cause it's not my business and it seems like a touchy subject  which brings to mind richard who called paul a dick after I told him that paul had told me that he kissed jade I think I'm getting better at accepting the fact that they're together at least it's easier to do up here than in NB it seems that the further away from my problems I am the easier they become to handle I wonder how many other people are doing their assignments today my alarm just went off and it scared the crap out of me I'll have to go get my laundry after I'm done maybe I'll try out my new iron and ironing boars are we supposed to  
__label__label0 Okay so now I am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing. I wonder why I have to type that out what am I thinking of course this is what I am going to write        this music that I am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer I feel very stressed out writing to a real timer I don't know why        I think I will take off my head phones    I had planned to write about a lot but for some reason I can't seem to do more than   write what my head is thinking about    for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did I guess I can start by describing my environment lets see    the air smells like air    the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window    right now there isn't any noises and I feel somewhat stressed and anxious    the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not I actually have a though or not and I think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct    if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed    I can't believe I have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like I have to help him but I fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me    I just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart    as if I feared that I am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly    I can't believe I have already written for 0 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts    but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what I am doing, like I cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which I was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here I am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and I wonder if I am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense I really hope it does because if it doesn't well I guess my mind is simply disorganized    but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, I really think I cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do I actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything I've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? I have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather I can hear it, its a strange process         I guess I really can't multitask when I am writing a stream of consciousness I see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered        perhaps I am not truly tracking my own mind I MUST DWELL FURTHER IN. I'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something I didn't know existed        I remember my childhood I don't know why but for some reason I start remembering it whenever I think too hard that or I am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should I go pick it up? maybe I will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like I had to pick it up for a bit, I hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 00 seconds of non thought but I can make up for it because it was my friend who I needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though I dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here I am fixing mistakes in my typing        maybe I should just leave my mistakes in so I can listen to myself more. right well now I feel nostalgic or actually no I don't I just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and I was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if I were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. I miss my childhood and here I am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. I would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but I guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about  it, yeah I make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually I have written so much    originally I had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but I guess that was yesterday night when I was heated up about it today I just feel complacent about writing about nothing. I see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now I feel disappointed        why am I disappointed? I guess I just thought I could find something that could prove that I am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that I write even regular to all people? I don't know but I like being special. well no. now I feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 0 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, I can't really plan ahead, I can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away I guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and I don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps I forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am I so eager to put interest in this bit, I do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what I just said god. now I am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if I tried to organize it I would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that I think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes I end up saying nothing because I dunno I know I obviously have a stream now but I guess since none of it makes much sense I can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps I am just afraid that if I do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 0 more seconds. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. bye     
__label__label1 Well, I guess this is the first time that I have ever done anything like this. I mean, the first time that I have talked about ANYTHING to anyone. What I'm really thinking about right now is index cards. I need to make flash cards for my Introduction to Medical and Scientific Terminology class, and I don't have any index cards. I feel like I need to complete that task now. Why is it that I must always do EVERYTHING in one day? I just can't ever seem to take my  time and relax. I guess if I had any form of OCD, that would be it; I'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule. Now, if I wait until this Stream of Consciousness Writing is over, it'll be like almost eleven thirty at night before I'm done. Should I really go out and get my index cards then? I need like a pack of 000 of them, but I really need more for the future. I guess I could wait to get more index cards when I get home to LOCNAME this weekend, then I would know exactly where to buy them, or I could even get my mom to get them for me in LOCNAME, that would be very convenient for me. I miss my mom most. She does everything for me. Its not that I miss her just because she did everything for me; its just that she is this really great person. She is so genuine. I know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy. Why can't I meet more people like that in my life? I hope I marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can. Man, I miss my dog, too. I guess I am a little obsessed with my dog, but I can't help it. She is so cute. And she is been there ever since I was like 00. We're inseparable, and I wonder and worry about how she is doing without me. Dogs are great aren't they? They never get angry at you or make you upset. They always are loyal, and give love one hundred percent. I wish that people could be as nice as dogs are. I wish my boyfriend would be happier. He is the main reason why I worry so much of the time. I really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen, until I met him. I worry a lot about him, not about our relationship, but about him. I wish he would be happier, treat himself better, love himself more, and feed himself. The man's the pickiest man I have ever met! I have never made one thing that he thought was yummy. I have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good. Everything is always decent. " Decent? I know he doesn't mean to be condescending in any way, but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending. I know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, I don't know if he will ever feel that. That's one thing about psychology. My boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when I try to give it to him. I believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything I do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. His mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. It's all in the mind. If he told himself to like it, he would; But the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. All right, I'm going to shut up about him all ready. I think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. It's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show "Sex and the City," except that these thoughts are really not very private because I guess Professor PROPNAME or one of the TA's is going to read it, but I'm really okay with one of them reading it. It's not like I have anything really vulgar or nasty to say. I'm so full. I don't think I should have eaten all that PROPNAME PROPNAME and Cheese, but hey, on the bright side, its a great source of calcium, which is something that growing women need, so I guess its kind of a good thing. Hahaha. I can't believe that I just tried to justify overeating, at least I don't have to worry about getting fat over it. Nobody in my family is fat or even chubby. I don't think I've gained any weight here because I do so much walking, so who cares if I ate extra macaroni; I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I added salt to it instead of butter, thus I feel no guilt. Dude, I could really go for a ORGNAME right now. ORGNAME ORGNAME is so good. Its so expensive though, and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys. What makes it taste so good? I think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it; not like that nasty gross Diet Cola. Diet Cola is disgusting. I don't understand why people drink Diet when there's real Cola. I'm sleepy. I don't sleep much here in LOCNAME, because all I do is go to school, and then I come home, eat, and then do homework for the whole rest of the time. It's a bitch. I need my sleep man. I don't get more than 0 hours of sleep at most. I had four freaking classes today! Can you believe that? from 0 in the morning to 0 in the afternoon, I had class. And get this, what really made today bad was that while I was waiting for the bus, a huge, green, black striped, spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face! I thought I was going to DIE! I HATE SPIDERS! If I had any kind of phobia, its spiders. I don't like any bugs, but Spiders are the worst. They're so ugly and creepy and scary. I thought I was really going to cry. It made me so anxious and nervous. I went home and showered. My writing assignment is almost over now. I feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time, how pathetic. hahaha. I'm kinda sad because I like writing all my thoughts down, but I'm relieved because I have a lot of other stuff to do still. 
__label__label0 I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at LOCNAME because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to ORGNAME and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at LOCNAME so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 00 more sec. blah blah    00 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. 
__label__label0 I have no clue how to start this. I haven't bought my psychology book yet. Is that bad? I wish I could do that DJ thing at the beginning of class. The guy last time played horrible music. I made a friend in that class named PROPNAME. She seems cool. I hope we get to hang out. This feels like a diary entry. Is that what it's supposed to be like?  Today PROPNAME and I went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. One girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. It really got on my nerves. Not because I'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. PROPNAME is really annoying me. I'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. But hang out with him at the same time. And PROPNAME. I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. I don't know if I love him or not. I don't know if I'll ever really be in love. He says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for  me to say sweet things back to him. But I don't know if I really feel it or not. I think I'm really heartless. And I haven't been in English for a long time! I'm forgetting whether to capitalize the I" in some words. Odd. My arm hurts. Am I going to have to keep this up for 00 minutes? I wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. Mine is all boring teenage bullshit. Let's try and write something deep. It's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. All the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. The faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. Aaaand I'm spent. That was so lame. Bullshit, as my English teacher would say. He is really cool. He made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. And he taught at LOCNAME, which is my ORGNAME. I would love to go to school in LOCNAME. Hopefully next year I can go to ORGNAME and be near PROPNAME and see if this thing will really work out. Are boys the only thing on my mind? Am I really that shallow? At this moment, I'm afraid so. I blanked. I have to start a new stream. I'm losing a lot of weight, I think. My wrists are smaller than they used to be. I don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. I want to be super skinny. And if not eating is how I have to get there, I just might do it. I don't think I'm fat right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear PROPNAME typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see PROPNAME again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give PROPNAME all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. PROPNAME and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend PROPNAME as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. PROPNAME is nice. She listens to PROPNAME. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most PROPNAME girls are lesbians. And PROPNAME, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from LOCNAME that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. PROPNAME gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think PROPNAME is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or wrong way to do it? I hope not. I'm sure I'm doing it the wrong way. PROPNAME just told me that he is joining the army. I don't want him to. And I told him why. And he told me not to be punk rock because I'm an indie princess. That's so lame. Just because I listen to that kind of music doesn't mean I can't have political views. And this was a good exercise. Very therapeutic. Thank you, Professor! 
__label__label0 I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -000 to a 000 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  
__label__label0 Last week I took a Chinese Clep test. It started out very well, I understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. As you know, the Cantonese language is written in two different formats. One way, the tradition way, was the one I learned since I was a little kid. The other format was a newer, I believe it originated in LOCNAME LOCNAME or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking". Anyways, I opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. So I spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. Then, I decided to just skip through to the end. That is when I figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. "Damn it!" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. But of course, that was last week, and I already have my results back from the test. I believe I did relatively well. Relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. Today, Monday, is the first day I have been to my RLM Biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. I must say, I am completely exhausted. Biology discussion was quite an episode. We had an TA that had a really really bad accent. Much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. Some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. Then we took a quiz, which I found to be a bit difficult because I didn't understand teh oral review. I had to buy books today. Spent a whopping 000 dollars just on two stupid books that I probably won't be needing much. I could have found many many other uses for that 000, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. Geez, look at my grammar in this essay, I think my english teacher would have a heart attack. Psych class was pretty interesting today. Dr. PROPNAME brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. I was completely fascinated by the experiment. Too bad I can't say the same for my Philosophy class. Its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. And so I obeyed. I notice that when I'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. But of course, I wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. You can definitely tell at what point in the lecture I crashed. The funniest part is, I lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. I think since I have been here at LOCNAME for the fall, I have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. I have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. I worry about other stupid things that I feel the need not to bring up at this moment. However, I have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. I have been recreating too much. This weekend though, we went to LOCNAME LOCNAME to see a friend that came up to visit us from ORGNAME. LOCNAME LOCNAME was nothing like I had imagined. I absolutely loved it. Everything except the coldass water. Then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. It felt like summer again. Of course, I had enrolled in the UT Summer program. A little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. I miss summer. 
__label__label0 As I look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 00:00AM on September 00. I am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago. They still should strike a painful memory in every Americans life. I remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment. I also feel a little stress with all ORGNAME the homework that college brings along with it. LOCNAME is so much different than my hometown of LOCNAME, and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it. However, I have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far. I cannot wait to say that I am a graduate of the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. That will mean so much to me and my family, since it will be an amazing accomplishment. I just remembered that my laundry basket is full, and I need to do that sometime before Friday since I may be leaving town for a Pat Green concert. Hopefully, the laundry room at the end of my floor, 0th in Jester West, will not be full. Surely I can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that I did not complete. I sure hope I can adjust to college as well as I have set my goals. My roommates are out of the room right now, and I am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here. They are both from LOCNAME also, and I have been friends with them for about 0 years. My parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much I appreciate them paying for me to come down here. I know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence, but me and them know it is for the best. I am convinced that the Business program at ORGNAME will set me up for a very successful life. My hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously, and my eyes are starting to close. I feel like falling asleep, but I know how much work I still have left to do. For some reason, I get most of my work done around or after midnight. It helps that I don't have a class until 00 on MWF and 00 on ORGNAME. I am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church. It is important to me to find a church in LOCNAME and not forget the ways from which I was raised. Many people believe LOCNAME is so liberal that every student comes out weird, but I believe there is something for everyone in Austin. I have already met so many people just like me, and it is awesome. By far I can tell that college will be the best time of my life. The only thing I wish I could change is the dorm food. I am  getting so tired of chicken every meal. I do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken. Well the saying goes, everything tastes like chicken anyways. Maybe next year I can get an apartment with some of the new people that I meet and possibly the guys from LOCNAME too. I am trying to figure out why my email is not working. It keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying. Oh well, two more days to the weekend. LOCNAME comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game. I saw some of the football players today. Wow, they are so huge. They are like a different breed of people. I want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big. I know it is some sort of phenomenon or something. I figured out that in 0 minutes I have to find something new to do so I am already brainstorming. I wish every paper was this easy. English papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind. It could go on forever. I never have to stop and think. Dell: what an amazing company. How does someone without a college education make so much money?  I hope my college education will lead me to success like that. Well, time is up. 
__label__label1 wow I feel really tired right now  why the hell did I schedule five classes three days of the week   oh well  alright I don't feel stupid typing this   at least my roommate is getting less psycho except for the whole 0 alarms and 0 phone call everyday at the same time I have so much crap to do let me think   read about 0 million pages, chem hmwk, get computer paper so I can stop stealing my roommates and a lot of other crap  I'm glad that I'm living in Kinsolving Jester sucks haha PROPNAME's cousin and PROPNAME have to live there. lame o  anyhow I'm glad that I got to talk to my mom today I should talk to the rest of my family more often  it's kind of weird not seeing them everyday   I kind of miss them  don't get me wrong I don't want to be back in corpus  but there are a lot of people that I care about and who care about me there  I guess that is why I still feel like corpus is my home  not austin  although austin is way more badass   more things to do  I wonder how cecily is doing with her school stuff haha that was so funny today in philosophy when he showed that simpson clip about lisa and she was not going to get into harvard and she was like  I Don't want to go to PROPNAME!

They're nice girls I just don't know if I like it yet. I really don't want to live in the house next year   that would be sucky  I want to get an apartment  but I do think that it is cool living on campus  your first year because you meet so many new people  yeah    anyhow  I really really  got to pee    I won't think about it   haha  this is so lame  what the hell am I doing and why   I guess it's  kind of cool. kind of like talking to yourself. real cool  whatever  tonight I'm going to rum another mile   got to get back into soccer shape   you know how  that goes    oh I sure do hahaha  alright I sound really psycho I can't wait until we get a break   I'm going to get a massage  that'll be nice     hard work then a sweet ass reward      I got to call cec and cheryl  today  get some normalcy back into my life   people that arent fake or weird   well a little  weird   but will tell me like it  is and make me feel at home   that is what I think I need a balance between my future and my past which I couldn't do in CC  My mom just called and she can't get the radio to work anyway    a connection from the real me the old me to the me I'm involving into   I don't think that I am changing that much  well a lot more  responsibility   personal responsibility but not too many changes in my personality  ahh my hands are getting tired of typing    my roommate is getting cooler   she does not  eep me up to 0 am  anymore  thank god    oh yeah I think I'm going to go to church Sunday   I can't forget about that because I want to meet new people at that church and I want to have a few seconds of peace in my life  when everything's not such at a fast pace  a place where I can breathe  ahhh I'm so tired and I still HAVE to pee  please hurry and end so I can pee  ahh   less than two minutes  alright  time  fly  by  faster my stomach is growling too maybe I'll go eat a little later  alright   well  less than a minute    got to  go to the bathroom   alright   ok   hrmmm   not really thinking about anything else   except I got to pee      ok   got to go     almost do 
__label__label0 Why can I not think of anything to type the moment when I click the start link? This is so weird, I just hungry everytime after I am done showering. Why is that? Is it because while I am showering my body also takes the food away from my stomach? I wonder why my feet are so smelly even though I have already taken a shower. My roommate seems to be busy all the time and never seem to have any time to chill or hang out with me and some other people. I think that guy in the SPE meeting today was pretty cute. Hopefully I will be able to meet him sometime. Wow, it is getting pretty late right now and I am getting a little bit sleepy. I took the Pretesting for the psychology required experiment testing and it was really long! It was so detailed that I was about to give up and continue it some other time and go to sleep instead. Man, I really don't know what to do about Calculus. I seem to be struggling in all of my math classes and if I still don't get help by next Monday, I will be screwed. I feel kind of floaty? Is that the word to describe it? My feet are really cold right now, I wonder why. My hands are a little cold too. Hmm. I think it's because that the temperature in this room is getting lower and lower. I really want the temperature to go up a little more if not it's going to be freezing in here like my other friends' dorms at LOCNAME LOCNAME. Man. I still have 0 more classes tomorrow but good thing that I don't have any classes on Friday! Yay! I think I am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be hard for me to find something that will match with it. If not, I can ask my sister if she wants to buy it from me or not. Hopefully she would want it so then I wouldn't have to make a trip back to the mall to return it. I am feeling really tired and sleepy right now. I wish I can go to sleep but I have to get some work done before it will be too late. Hopefully I will be able to go back to LOCNAME sometime this or next weekend. I really want to see my cute little brother! I miss him a lot! Ouch, my right arm is aching now. I think it's because I have been using the computer too much and typing a lot. I think I really do need a break from the computer. Where is he? I really want to talk to him but it seems like he is either always away or I talk to him and he never replies. That is really annoying. My contacts feel a kind of weird. I think I should take them out and put on my glasses instead. Hmm. I really do wonder why my roommate has to leave that music on forever. Is it because it soothes her from all of the pain and stress through out the day? That's probably the reason why. I really do wonder why she wants to be a vegetarian. I think it's quite interesting even though I really don't think I can live without eating any meat in my life. Meat is just too good. I wonder why one of my friends today acted kind of strange. I think she probably felt bad for me for not being able to make it in time to eat dinner with me or it's probably because that she wants to find out something that has to do with either me or this other friend of mine. I think that it really annoys me a lot when she acts in this immature way and causes me to not be able to trust her even more. A few of my friends on AIM are messaging me and I am trying to reply to them even though I am concentrating on typing this up. She was asking me about whether I will be going to the next football game or not. Should I go? But I think that the tickets is going to be rather expensive but going to one wouldn't be that bad since I have never gone to one before. Man. it's only been a few days of my first classes in college and I am gradually starting to hate it. Why do college math professors just scribble random things on the board? I mean can they at least have a little bit more organization? It makes me so confused on understanding the material and I can't even figure out how to solve the homework problems. I wish I can change my calc professor but I think that is going to be impossible. Ouch, both of my arms hurt now, I think I should be getting off the computer really soon. An individual sports package? What is that? For 00 dollars? I really don't know if I should get it because I don't really want to spend all of my money on football tickets. All right, I think my time is almost up and I am so happy I can go to sleep now!  
__label__label0 I am downloading stuff on kazaa. I've saved so much money this way. I need to make sure my grammar, punctuation, and spelling are correct. I have a basketball (plush) on my table, although I never play with it. Yeah, my web cam sucks. It's old. But free. My roommate is cool. He is sitting there doing the survey. I had a good day today. I want to go to the church next to PROPNAME. Probably this sunday. Yeah. Sunday sounds good. 0000 is my room number. I have a song stuck in my head right now. I can't remember the name of it. actually, I didn't know the name to begin with. Its a rap song. I need to charge my Palm m000. And take a shower. That would feel good. My mouth is dry. I need something to drink. Now I need to piss. It's really dark in here. This apple juice is not good for my teeth. I think there's sugar in it. Not good. Wow, it's only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. That sucks. I'm getting bored. I want to play some computer games. Too bad I'm stuck with this assignment. Oh, now I have a different rap song stuck in my head. I think I'm obsessed with them. I remember listening to this song a few hours ago before dinner. I was at my friends house if I can remember correctly. Humans are funny. I need to spend my taco bell coupon. Coupon or Coupon? I've heard it pronounced both ways. I wonder when my parents are going to call? Probably soon after 0? Or maybe 0:00? Haha, I just remembered something from dinner. My friend was taking pictures of girls with his phone camera. The asterisk looks like a snowflake. I noticed that I like to stand my chair up on it's front two legs. Well, that is if it had legs. It's more like a bar on both sides and connected in the middle. At least its comfortable, unlike the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Yeah. LOCNAME LOCNAME. I went on a field trip there. No, wait. It was LOCNAME on the LOCNAME. Maybe that is close. I don't know. I like the way you do it right thar. A line from the song I have stuck in my head. Geez, its been 0:00 only. Like I said earlier, this sucks. Damn, I'm typing too fast and my grammar is messing up. My speaker system and subwoofer rock. My hands hurt from typing so much. I should study more. I haven't even opened any of my books yet. Oh well, the weekend is coming up. I can do most of my stuff then. I hope I'm not going to be like this later on in the year. It's a bad sign. I hope I don't get lost in my homework assignments. I can't seem to find the Philosophy 000 website. Not good. Yeah. I got a nice view from here. I need to email my parents and send them more pictures. Awww, how sweet of me. I never realized how long 00 minutes can be. Wow. It's like. long. Yeah, anyways, I feel kind of weird talking to myself. Weird? Or is it spelled wIErd? I will have to look that up later. I'm sore from sitting like this. Well, I only have 0 more items on my download list in ORGNAME Lite K++. If you read this, get the K++ edition, not Kazaa, not Diet Kazaa, and not Kazaa Lite. K++ &gt; *. Yuuuhhhhhhhhh. I'm bored. I need to shower. I already mentioned that didn't I? Awesome, only 0 0/0 minutes to go. This sucks. It's boring. I'm not thinking of anything. My neck hurts. I don't smell anything out of the ordinary. I guess I got used to the smell of my room. 0 more minutes! I don't think I can last that long. I don't want to go to prison. Heh, it's not a confession or hinting at anything I've ever done. I'm a good guy. Yeah. Good. Maybe too good. Nah. 0 0/0 minutes to go. Wow, I'm really slowing down. This would probably take up 0 to 0 pages in ORGNAME Word, 00 point font, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's kind of sad how I can know this. I will test it out whenever I finish the 00 minutes. I also need to test out w(ei/ie)rd. SAT format baby. Yeahhhhh! 00 seconds! I think I will just wait it out. I'm so happy now. YAY! 
__label__label0 I have no idea what to type. am I supposed be be capitalizing and what not?  oh well. hmm its mike's birthday today. he is 00, that must be nice. wow, this is a great song straylight run - the tension and the terror. it's freezing in here. I need to finish reading government and psychology, and hopefully on the road too. it's a lot easier reading that though. yoga's at 0:00. am I supposed to meet melissa there or is she coming back to the room?  o well. I miss mikey =(  man, as I'm whining as if this is a diary entry. man, I forgot to call alex again. I guess I'll do it later. hmm, I wonder how tough rowing tryouts really are. o well. man, all I'm saying is o well. still not really sure what I'm supposed to be writing. now I'm listening to the juliana theory. good stuff. I'm not all about the class dj's choice of rap stuff. I don't think he is right about it making people more energetic. hearing a song for the millionth time that wasn't good the first time does not exactly put me in a great mood for an hour and a half psych lecture. but I do think I'm going to like the class (as I'm kissing up to the computer). no, its interesting stuff though. hmm, I'm still not sure about how government is going to be. I want to do law, and I think it's really interesting, but there's no way I'll have time for all the reading. and a lot of it is way too boring. hopefully if I take notes in class and what not I'll be ok. I hope calc won't be too hard this semester. a lot of it should still be review from high school, but I bet the end will be new hard stuff. too bad mikes not still around. the engineering majors are too damn smart. am I supposed to censor stream of conscious writing? because I figure that goes against the point, so I shouldn't go back and fix stuff, but this sure as heck isn't formal. o well. of course I am tempted to go back and count how many times I've said o well. ridiculous. hmm, I should really clean this room. but I guess most of the mess on my side is amber's junk. o, I guess no psych tomorrow. more time to nap in the afternoon, which is good because I know I'll be up way too late if I'm going to get close to finishing the reading for government. how late is gregory open?  I think 0 but is that every day?  I guess megan will know. we can always run outside too. the heat sucks, but I guess we should get used to it if we're going to have to do tryouts in the afternoon. texas is too damn hot. I miss wisconsin. we got to road trip over xmas. I don't know what to tell the parents though. hmm I'll have to plan. that way we can go by michigan like we told mike we would. hmm I miss summer. I know fall won't compare. I'm so sick of stupid frat parties, etc. at least I have awesome roomies. well, looks like times almost up and I've spent 00 minutes whining and doing this assignment completely wrong. once more, oh well. 
__label__label1 Okay so I was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. This was something that I really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and I seemed to have noticed a difference. I first tried it out on reading a book. I realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what I was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. When listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and I kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. I am listening to a dj named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is a trance dj, and even as we speak I can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what I am writing. Yesterday, last night, actually I was doing some reading and I started to first listen to hip hop and I kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because I know a lot of them. I ended up spending about 00 minutes and I got through about 00 or 00 pages which is incredibly slow. After that I decide to try out some trance. I actually used to always listen to trance last year when I would read or study because I always helped my expand my mind when I was either designing things, reading, or writing. So when I was reading I noticed that I was much more attentive to what I was doing and got a lot more than 00 pages read in a 00 minute time period. As of right now I am trying out this trance thing again. The funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. The TV  is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the TV  but to the work that we need to get done. After thinking about this right now I am at 0 min 00 sec and I have already written a lot. I believe that if I would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. Another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that I am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music?  I mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together? Or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body's response system that makes you feel all numb inside. Could this be another type of an anesthetic, but instead of a shot, gas, or gel, could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic?  Who really knows. But anyway that I am sure has been looked at for a long time. I really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me. But right now I really don't know what else I wamt to talk about because I am out of time. 
__label__label1 I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat. If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more PROPNAMEoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester. I really don't know where there's room to park a ORGNAME ORGNAME in this town, but I'll find some place. My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride. I was pretty upset, but My PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. He was right. I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday. It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it. The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before. I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time. I work out 0 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs" (rowing machines. )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the LOCNAME LOCNAME airport after a two week cruise through LOCNAME LOCNAME. We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again. Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair. A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body. The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far. I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing. Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 00 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often. 
__label__label0 Well I'm sitting at my computer and I don't really have much to say. For some reason I feel as though my mind is completely blank. My roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. I am so tired right now. Last night I was up with no thoughts in my head. I was just not able to sleep for some reason. I really hope that this school year goes good for me. I know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. I have always dreamt of coming to college and now that I am finally here it still seems like a dream. I guess its just hard to believe that I'm on my own, six hours from home. I miss my old friends and my girlfriend, PROPNAME, I can't wait to see here this weekend. Football season is about to start and I am getting so excited to see my first Longhorn game. My mind just went blank again. no thoughts. I think I just used to many dots between words. My nose itches. I need to use the bathroom, but I still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and I don't want to stop now. For some reason it seems as though I have been here typing for a long time but really I haven't even typed much. Maybe I type slow. I'm trying to think of what to type now. It seems so easy. ?Just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe I'm trying to hard. The phone is ringing. I guess I'll get it. it is was my mom. Yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. That sounds good to me because I could really use it right now. It looks as though I have barely typed anything. I'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. Man I'm thirsty. I could use a spite or a cold coke. Maybe I'll go get one in a little while, or not cause I need to save money. It's tough not having a job and wanting so much. I'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that I don't even need in the first place. Six more minutes and I will be done. It actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. I wonder how my dog is doing. I hope my mom is feeding her just as I said, and giving her lots of water. She needs that especially in the hot sun. I can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. No thoughts. still none. I think I'm getting addicted to the dot thing. Two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. Every second seems to go by slower and slower now. I really don't want to drive home this weekend. I wish I could fly, but I'll be alright. I just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. Well it's been twenty minutes so I guess I'm done. 
__label__label0 I am thinking right now that this is kind of difficult. I don't want everyone to know my personal thoughts. I guess I have to do it anyway to make a good grade on this. I need to get everything done so that I can go home. I have to clean my room and do the psychology experiment, which takes a long long time. I don't know what to expect from it either. Oh well, it's required so I am going to do it. I can't wait to go home because when I do I get a snow cone. That might sound juvenile to be happy about something like that, but there are a lot of people who like them. I especially like pink lemonade with ice cream in the middle. I think I might get that. I always get it though. I guess I don't like to try new things. This is actually kind of fun. My friend PROPNAME is in this class too. Are ya'll going to take off for backspaces?  I don't even know if ya'll can see when we erase stuff. I am a fast typer, but I make a lot of mistakes. That's why I am saying that I erase. My friend PROPNAME also made me a cd. It's really good. It's funny because it has songs on it that apply to my life. Well not necessarily my life, but a boy in my life. I'm very confused about him. I'm not saying that he is gay. I just don't know what to do. It seems that I have been thinking and talking about him all the time. I e-mailed him and everything. I think that if you think about something too much it gets boring after awhile. You just confused yourself even more. What happened with him is that we liked each other, but I didn't know what I wanted from our relationship and so I guess I got scared. Now I don't know what to do. I always say that if it is meant to be it will be later. God is the only one that knows the future. That's what I don't like. I wish I just knew all the answers to everything. Man I just lost my train of thought. That's not cool. Anyway this writing assignment is pretty easy. I think it helps to get things out. We think a lot. Gahlee. My grammar is bad. Oh well, it doesn't really matter. Let me think of something else to talk about. Hmmmmm, I guess I can talk about my room mate. Maybe tell stories. Not bad ones of course. I'll write down how we met. I was really afraid that I would be shy at orientation since I was in high school. High school was crap. I wasn't made fun of and stuff. I was just ready to get out of there. I went to orientation and she was my roommate there because we are both in Preview which is a group that takes summer school and they pay for everything except for $000 of it. It actually helps you a lot. You get 0 hours of credit for $000 and you make a lot of friends. That's actually where I met that guy. PROPNAME and I got a long really well. It seems that we are exactly alike. That's really cool. She lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Well, she is from there she lives here. Ok so we met and I was pretty outgoing which is a good thing. I have changed a lot. I changed when I got here. I think that is weird because usually it takes me a long time to get used to a place. You get off track in these things easily. I was just thinking a second ago about how I went to my pal teacher's class and it threw me off. I thought of it because I talked about how different it has been coming here. My friend and I went to her class so that we could see her and she ended up making us talk about college. I miss Pals so much. It was a lot of fun just really difficult sometimes. It was kind of like Preview in a way. People could get in your business easily. I can't stand it when people don't mind their own business. That's funny because I am really nosey myself. Not in the sense that I like to learn everything about everyone's personal lives just that I am curious about everything. I really like this cd. She did a good job. PROPNAME, PROPNAME's b/f is coming to visit her this withe. I hope that ya'll know what b/f and withe mean. PROPNAME really likes him I think. He seems like a really sweet guy. The guy that I like is sweet too. I haven't even said his name yet. I guess I should but somethings need to remain private. Then again it's not like ya'll would know who he is. Awww friends are friends forever. I love this song. It's so sweet. Man my time is almost up that's not fun. I like doing this. I'm singing in my head. I would type that out but it would take too long. I wonder who else likes this song. 
__label__label0 Well, first I'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever been given. I'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom I'm very in love with, but I really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. My roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. Which is what I am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that I have to do!  I think that if I can just do that then I will be able to keep with all ORGNAME my work and get grades in my classes that I will approve. I also need to get into the college of communications so therefore I HAVE to keep my grades up. I really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, I'm very excited about that. Also, God willing I really do think it would be awesome to go to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME for their graduate program in speech pathology. They have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if I'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus!  Ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and I'm sure whoever reads this is going think that I am a weirdo, but I really don't have much else to talk about. Hmmm. I am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family!  I think we will have a lot of fun and I'm excited that I get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. I'm having loss of words at the moment. And someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on!  Ok I did. lets get back on track here. I'M curious as to who gets to read these because I bet that would be a lot of fun. I'm sure that there are LOTS of different things said on each persons assignment. Gosh only 0 minutes of typing! Is this ever going to end!  (hey I'm being honesty here!)  I bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than I am, but I really am typing my thoughts and feelings. Actually I'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making NO sense at all. I think that sitting here and typing out what I'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what I would really be thinking about, because I'm trying to find something to think about that I can type about. Wow that was a confusing sentence. I'm surprised at how much fun I'm having here. I honestly thought that I would become homesick and miss everything back home and I also thought I would miss ryan a lot more than I am. I mean I do miss him, yes!  But there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things. Not complaining because I'm glad I'm not sitting around moping about him, I need to enjoy life, especially college life!  I really can't wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls. The girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you, but I'm sure if I was a guy I probably would not mind. Sitting here wondering what I'm going to type next. I'm not supposed to be planning anything out, which I'm not, but sometimes I just don't think about anything. I don't always have to have something on my mind do I?  Much less a feeling". feelings are sometimes so over-rated. Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 00 minutes. Well I just re-read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought, so I had to type it. Ok 0 more minutes to go, I'm almost there!  Gee I didn't realize how often I just don't think about stuff, but I usually do think a lot about different things, I guess just not now. I consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker, and have more mature thoughts than other people that I know. Take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm "yeah theta!". very loud, annoying, and obnoxious. Yes these are the people I am living with, sweet girls but nothing like me. I don't get into all the sorority stuff. Times running out. whoo hoo!  Now I can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment. which is, I must say the easiest graded assignment I have ever done!  So I think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this. Good idea huh?  Now I can think about is how I want this to end. I have about a minute to go. So I will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and I hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and "feelings" for 00 minutes of my life. Sorry if I bored you, which I probably did. but its ok, I'm really not a boring person!  Well have a good day and goodbye!  
__label__label0 Well, I am almost ready to leave tomorrow back to my house in fort worth, although I would like it to be better to go back because since I have to work tomorrow, that makes it kind of boring and I cannot stop thinking about work instead of enjoy my time over there. Every time I go I always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend, that actually never really happens, I don't really know how I feel about it because sometimes I feel frustrated that I cannot do anything about it but then I analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head. The fist thing I have to do before I leave is get all my homework done, including this assignment that I didn't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does. Since the first day that I slept in this dorm, it seems that the bed is not for me or something, I cannot fall asleep, and if I do, I wake up every 00 min and look at my clock to see if it's time to go to class. I remember I used to love school when I was in high school last year, everything was so cool, nothing was going so bad to call it bad, grades, girlfriend, family MONEY, but now some times I feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with, I cannot handle so much stress, never had so much actually. anyways, the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because I know I'm not a failer. Hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good!. The biggest problem that I have and that I think already gave me a pain in my neck, well that's because I cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so  I think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems. I have to pay my whole semester rent next monday, that's one of the reasons I'm going home tomorrow, to get a juicy check that will just fly away from my hands. I only I was living in my house and going to a college near, I would be able to keep all that money and use it to get rid of my debt and actually be able to buy a gift for my girlfriend. I have bunches of pictures of her all around my room. I also have pictures of my mother and little sister. she is 0 and I miss her. I hope tonight I can fall asleep easy so I won't be tired during my 0 hour drive. everytime I drive tired I get nervous and think that I may fall asleep and all these thoughts come to my mind that I'm going to crash a big truck and never make it home. I know that the odds are really small and then I get better once I start listening to this exact same music I'm listening to right now. its a band called mana, is from mexico and they play really good kidda alternative music but is really meaningful and then they talk about world peace and they help children with massive foundations, with no doubt my favorite band. they are coming to dallas next october, I can't wait till then to go to the concert, I went to one last november and I still remember almost every second of it, this time I'm thinking on taking my girlfriend to make the concert even better. I just hope that I will have money to but the tickets then, cause now I don't. jeje,     A few hours ago I was doing my physics homework, it's just really hard, when I was in high school I was the best kid on physics and now I just feel really bad when I don't understand!, never happened before, I don't know if is because I cannot concentrate or because it's just really hard or because I'm loosing my intelligence, I think of that all the time, I have this scholarship that is helping me a lot with my finances but if my gpa goes down 0. 0 , they will take it away and then I will really be in deep trouble. I just saw a picture or one of the pictures I have of my girlfriend in my room and that reminded me that I have to ask her if her dad said yes! finally. we have been going out for almost a year and she just turned 00 last saturday, I was a really nice night, the problem is that her father doesn't know about us yet, we are afraid we might not like our relationship and then all would fall down. I feel guilty for making her disobey her dads rules but we love each other and finally I would be the happiest guy ever if I can make it trough this semester maintaining  a good gpa and if my girlfriends dad agrees on our relationship. When I think of these, it feels like everything is worth it to wait and suffer and not sleep and study like crazy, so that's what I'm going to do 
__label__label1 I am so glad I made this assignment. why do I always leave things to the last moment like this. classic PROPNAME"  ivsuppose. I don't even want to write correctly -grammar and punctuations. It won't matter though. I am looking at all my different rings I have and how shaky my hands feel from working all day. I hope my dad will like my apartment. and I hope PROPNAME does not find out that PROPNAME is going with me tonight. what am I going to wear. what kind of dance will it be. will the main dancer be technically perfect or will I sit through the whole performance being annoying and critical. I hate lying. especially to my best friend. I can feel the guilt weigh my arms down. right down to my shaky hands. the rotating fan keeps whizzing past my face. I need a printer. I'm surprised chris lets me use hers. the marker is going to dry out and chris will get mad. her shoes have no shoe laces and are very dirty. man I wonder what those things have seen. lots of drugs probably! but they are retired now. the donnas are very self assured with themselves. I wish I had a d-cup that people stared at. no not really, I like being petite, brenna always complains about her boobs. and Misty is getting fake boobs! what a freaking dumbass. she is like the classical example of female american mistakes. gets married at 00, boob job at 00, child at 00, divorce at 00. don't come crying to me because of your bad decisions. well no I would be a good friend I just feel very betrayed because she left me! and at a whim at that. ugh I wish ollie was not such a bad cat. the more I write the heavier my chest, I realize that I write about bullshit! maybe micheal will ask me out, that was what he was "trying" to do right? he is cute in a hispanic way and I love different cultures. but why is bryan perfect but unreachable. I would feel devastated if C  was doing what I was to me. why am I sweating. haha. I am kind of nervous for tonight. I hope it won't be awkward with PROPNAME there. I told PROPNAME not to worry about PROPNAME. shit what do I do. "classic PROPNAME" I don't think before actions enough. and what the hell am I going to wear tonight. I have to have that put together tight look. maybe stilettos and hair up. shit I am late and I still have 0 minutes of writing left. I thought I turned that dryer signal off. it irritates me. I can hear my bass from my room. that means PROPNAME can hear an awful lot. ok dad should be here at 0 and I leave at 000. arg what to do with PROPNAME. eek my phone is ringing, but I won't get it. now brennas phone is ringing. its a very strange "why the hell did you put it on that" ring. ahh my fav radiohead song just came on. it makes me want to be sad. I was talking to PROPNAME last night about depression and how easily slipped into it is. I would like just for a day to transform into someone else and see if they feel the same way all the time like its a characteristic of the human race or just me. I never close my jaw tight enough and Ill find myself with it hanging and it makes me so angry. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I need to take a shower and chill the fuck out. I am turning into my mother. it would be nice to have more plants in our apt. fix it up more. finish a painting. crap get canvas materials and you better not forget your books again. I really like PROPNAME. he is a good teacher, I like him because he reminds me of myself except he is 0 ft and black. very soft spoken. people seem to like me in painting. I should talk more tho. not like this tho. well shower time, this has actually relaxed my chaotic mind! 
__label__label1 I think I'm trying to hard to write what I'm thinking which defeats the entire purpose of this paper, you aren't supposed to think about what you write, you're supposed to write what you think about. Wow, I was impressed with that little quote there. I cannot live without you. " I've had that song stuck in my head all day long. It's a good song but I only know that much of it. I wish I could actually sing the rest of the words to that song instead of mumbling through them. I have a problem with singing lyrics. Why am I reading over what I have just wrote? I guess it's just a habit that I've gotten into after writing so many essays in my life. I usually despise essays. I love writing, just not essays. Hmmm. was that a pretty girl that just walked by? I just caught her foot as she passed my door. I think it was a pretty foot. I need to find a girlfriend. Girlfriends are great. Well, they can be. Depending on who it is. I loved my last girlfriend to death. I miss her so much. I hate not being able to see her any more. Curse age! Of course I do not wish I was 0 years younger but I do wish that she was 0 years older. Why did I bother to redo that sentence? I actually wrote 0 sentences and then combined them to make one. Am I following all of the rules to the "Stream of Consciousness" writing assignment?              I wonder if you can determine if a person has ADD by reading a "Stream of Consciousness" paper. Hell, by the time you get done with mine, you will probably think I am. Hell, hell, hell, hell, that word just stuck in my head for some reason. I wonder if that means that I'm satanic. "Thegreatjakobie" just signed onto ORGNAME instant messenger. "I can't talk buddy! I'm writing what I think!"          Metacognition. Thinking about thinking. That is such a cool concept. I often think about MEtacognition so I guess I can say that I often think about thinking about thinking. That actually makes sense. "I cannot live without you!. all that kjsoifl me, alkjsoithaj me, I cannot live without you!" Damn words. I should probably learn them. I often spell a word that I know how to spell but it doesn't look right when I write it so I spend like 0 minutes trying to determine if it's spelled right. I'm thinking about that damn song again. My elbow hurts. It pops a lot. I wonder if that means it's going to fall off one day. I don't think it's healthy. I don't know anybody else who's elbow hurts and pops on a regular basis. "Strike 0! You're out!" I hate baseball, but it popped into my head when I spelled basis. Bases. Stases! Rhetoric and Comp class sucks. It's not my cup of tea. Have you ever been in one of those really big tea cups that spin around really fast at carnivals? They suck too. When I get done I feel like I'm going to vomit all over my shoes. Vomit stinks a bunch. My friend PROPNAME doesn't like vomit either. He says that when he smells vomit, it makes him want to vomit too. And all the people around him will see all this vomit and pretty soon, the whole room is blowing chunks all over each other. Chain vomiting. Comforting. I'd like to stop thinking about vomiting now. "I cannot live without you!"        Latin drums can seriously rock! Especially in that damn song that I have had stuck in my damn head all day. My face itches. I hate when things itch. That would be a feeling that I would rather not have. If I had a choice of course. Only 0 minutes left! That sucks! I'm kind of getting into this whole writing thing! We should do this assignment every week! That would rock. oooooooowwwwwwwww! Damnit! I was stretching and when my arms came back down I hit my already broken ass elbow on my chair. That sucked! Oh man, that really depressed me. That hurt a whole bunch. AhhhH! 00 more seconds! Lets see how many letters I can hit! kasdfkjhasdkfjhaksdjhfkljasdhfkljadshfkljadshfkljahdsfkljhasdklfjhaklsdjhklahciluhekjhsdfkljahdsfkljhasfdkljhicukljaeno;iawejoijackjnOWEDJOAUR0000U0R000JOFJIEODFIJA0WE0URFOJKLJSDCVLIUADSHFCKJENRFLKH0PC0USDCIOAJERFKJRIOFJUP00UFOASDFJKJNCKDSJCPOAIUFPO0WUERO0QU0W0ROIQWJREFKNSDOVJOAISDUJVA00WEUF0WUEFROAWKEJRFLKIJSDFOLAIJSDFOIAUJFOIKW0EJFOIJASDOIFJASLDKFJAO;SDIFUJ0WAOEJFLKNVOIJC0000I0-00I-0I-0           hA!  That's how many letters I can type in 00 seconds. Well, technically, it was less than that because I was finishing that last sentence up. Well, my 00 seconds are up. Good luck on trying to pull meaning from this madness. 
__label__label1 I've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people, using them as test subjects, objectifying human beings, I really feel that it degrades their very being. I don't understand another human's need to study and examine what makes another human tick. I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity, but sadly I am not. I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs, in causes, in religion. They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they're involved in is important, means something, when in reality 000% of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them. None of it will rally matter once these people are gone, and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down, they've all had that thought in their life before. Yet they still go on, slaving their lives away, building the modern day pharaoh's modern day pyramids. Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth. God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations. Which raises another good topic, religion, now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups, just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way. Religion as we know it was made to control the masses, sort of a justification for law, and also something that keeps people inline above law, like a conscience. But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake. We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction. It's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters, as if one is even different that the others, they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy, keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives. In tribal societies religion doesn't have to be forced on the new generation, rather they welcome it with open arms, just as they aren't forced to work in their lives, rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society. People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me, it's clear that people can live, sustain life, off very little, and will slave their lives away rather than die. However I can't comprehend how our society got to this point, where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass. We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones, computers, tv's, cars, when it's a fact that none of these things even existed 00 years ago. People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 0 million years, people just like you and me, people just as smart, and just as naive. It's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around, the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians, but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live, that we have so enlighten found. People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we couldn't live without for nearly 0 million years. But those are all things that no one wants you to know, except maybe PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME. Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it isn't already too late. The doomsday clock is set to 00 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future. If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on. But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life. Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice. So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world. Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all. We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions. But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission. It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here. Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous. People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline. Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore. Anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out, there is no hope for the future we are writing now, at least none that includes us. For a species that holds it self in such hich regard, the top of the food chain, the center of the universe, in our own special classification, we sure act stupidly. If we were to open our eyes we'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions, with drugged up kids, both pharasudically, and illegally, allowing oppression, deforestation, slavery, pollution, and the lot to continue everyday, infact they make sure it grows, because you can't stop progress. They are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save" by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission, so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over. I'm here to tell you that no such place exists, god is just santa clause for adults. Where was god when the twin towers were hit, where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man, where was god when the germans were killing the jews, where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they don't even notice when they're doing it to their own children. I for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land. Everyday we scorch the earth with new roads, we rip the earth apart for new buildings, we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system. No one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here, before civilization no one had to work, in fact tribal people have no concept of work, they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living, doing whatever it is that they want to. We have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable, lazy, pointless, a waste, yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless, just as wasteful. Only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born, because the way we live is so heinous, so vile, so wrong that our children can't handle it, and for the most part neither can we. We could change everything in one generation, if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself, but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right, that this is the way things must be and that there's nothing we can do about it.

__label__label0 Today was a very hard day at school. After my first class, M000D, I read my Economics book for what seemed like forever. My friend PROPNAME can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. He is one of those, Everything has to my my way" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in "Spanglish" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. PROPNAME is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with PROPNAME PROPNAME's. The timer says 0 minutes 00 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do. Put up our sheep, clean the pool. My mom is going to kill me if I do not get those done. I guess I can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 00 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on LOCNAME. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 0 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $0 off a bag that I could get at ORGNAME for about $0. I did not get one. but if I had a quarter on me at the time I would have. I need to turn on my light as I can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. It is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. I needs to rain. They say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. Those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to "predict" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. But a weatherman does seem like a cool job. You can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying "Well we try to predict the weather the best we can but PROPNAME PROPNAME does what she wants sometimes. "  Alright, I only have 0 minutes left to write. My the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. My computer is getting old and I need a replacement. I have pop-ups bad. Somehow, somewhere, I got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. In doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. Basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. User-initiated contact goes through unmolested. So by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. I only have 0 minutes left to write now. That is good. Man, this is a sweet part of The Rock. This is the scene in which PROPNAME PROPNAME is in a yellow ORGNAME and is chasing PROPNAME PROPNAME, who is in a black Hummer. This scene has a lot of good action. I like action movies. I guess as I guy I find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. My belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. Without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. I still need to get my Economics book. I got the main one but the second one is still at the Co-Op. My luck they will run out of it by the time I remember to go by and pick it up. My dog needs to stop scratching. And my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. I would find that annoying. Man I could really use that drink now. Good thing I have less than a minute left to type. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME. "WooHoo!"  This has been fun. I actually wish I could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. Hope this is a good paper. Oh, it says if I want I can still keep on typing. In that case I think I will. Where did my remote go?. HAHA. got ya. you thought I was going to type more didn't ya?  Well ok I am done now. I can finally un-mute my TV and go get that ORGNAME. 
__label__label1 this is really boring, I'm so tired, I think I might take a nap after this but I have to write my social work notes. I wonder what will is doing in his class right now, I think this exercise will show that I think about him too much. I wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message I sent to her cell phone? should I go home this weekend? if I go home, I think I'll want to stay there, but if I don't go home I'll miss seeing my lil brother and I know he really wants to see me, its a good thing I haven't told him I'm thinking about it yet. I really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. I wonder if by getting him tickets I'm encouraging him to ditch class. I don't want to encourage him to do that, I want him to do well more than anything because I know that he wants out of ORGNAME so bad. I hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, I type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. I wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. I guess it is keeping me awake. I'm so tired, I just want to sleep once in awhile. I actually did sleep last night, I only woke up once I think. its so hard to sleep, I don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. I was so tired that I took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, I think he might be one of the best people I know. I wish more guys were like russ. I wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. I wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. I wish I could make more friends too. oh, I made a friend today in sociology. I let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. I hope I don't do that, but since I have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, I feel like such a pathetic loser here. I have friends, I really do, I keep telling myself this. but I don't think anyone here believes me. I walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when I have to. its such a pathetic existence. then I come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. I talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. I wish they were here. I hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. I wonder how he is. I hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. I think he probably does miss having everyone around. I wonder if marc is ok. I think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person I know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, I wish I was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. I think I was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. I was never like the prom queen or anything, but I had about a ton of friends, and I knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. I miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, I want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl I don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, I was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. I felt kinda bad for ditching the YL ppl, but I think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. I don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. I don't know, I tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. I can't believe his mom thought we were. I can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, I wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. I wonder where that frame I made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. I'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. I really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that I want him to get out of ORGNAME and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. I wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. I hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together I think. I can't believe that I miss everyone so much, and I can't believe that I care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. I wonder how he is. I can't believe he had a girlfriend. I wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is I'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. I'm not understanding that. I wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? I can't believe she would smoke. I bet she couldn't believe I would drink. why does armando think I would give it up to will. I may like the guy, but that doesn't mean I want to jump in a bed with him. I hope he was just kidding. I wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. I hope that doesn't happen to will, I hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too I'm sure if he pushes me. I hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave ORGNAME so that he doesn't ruin will. I hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. I know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would I do if he died and I was the last one to talk to him, and I knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? I would feel guilty. but there's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well I don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? I know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. I convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. I think I handle it better.

__label__label1 I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing," but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is going well. I got paid $00 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to "diet" for the next week, though they stress that it's not "diet[ing]," but more "finding a homeostasis" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a ORGNAME box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to ORGNAME for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because ORGNAME is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 0th of may, they don't get out till the 00th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked PROPNAME, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate PROPNAME and I might go visit them up in LOCNAME during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the PROPNAME PROPNAME soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at ORGNAME with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie "The Good Girl" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have. 
__label__label0 I thought I was supposed to set a timer. So I set one, and now I don't think I need it. its actually getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to use correct grammar? I'm not using it at all. I'm typing like I do when I talk to my friends online. I like this song on delilah. I love delilah. why don't others? She seems to always make me in a better mood. Or is it because I like depressing music. I love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. Actually, I think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. I think I cry a lot, but I'm not always depressed. I use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. Do I really like him though? Or am I just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner?  He treats me so well. Was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight?  oh well, I'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. But it bothers me when people don't like me. I miss my best friend lauren. That song today really brought back memories. I love college! I'm pretty much caught up on my work and when I finish this, I'll be even closer to being caught up. There is A LOT of reading u have to do in college. Wow. I hope I don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. I'm just so use to typing like this!  that's not good. I don't like this song right now I wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well I have bout 00 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. In fact, I think it's kind of interesting. What time is adam going to call? I wander if he is almost done with all his homework. I love my parents. I'm glad I talked to them tonight. I feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. I love all the people that are here. Many people thought I wouldn't like all the people, but I actually do!  I'm a big people person I guess. I don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in?  I probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. Oh well. At least I read a chapter of psychology today. I have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. I thought he was going to tell us when to read! I found out he didn't, and now I'm trying to catch up. I can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am I going to wear? I have no idea. maybe I can borrow something from sarah. Do I dress up or not really?  I wander if oscar is going to come or if PROPNAME is. How much is it to get in?  Well I have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. I'm so glad I got seventy dollars back today. what am I going to do with it?  I guess save it until I really need it. I think we need a lil more food in our room. I just don't feel like going to the store. PROPNAME had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us!  Ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. This is awesome! I can type without looking at the keyboard! I've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. I wander how I am going to be creative with my lonestar application. I really really want to make the organization. If I don't I'll be so sad. oh my gosh! I love this song. sure I'll think about you now and then. haha. I was singing. we can do that right? Because I was really singing it in my head. oh man. now I'm starting to feel stupid. Oh well. I wander what other people wrote about. hmm. I wander if I'm doing this right?  ok I'm tired of sitting up straight. I'm so full. I think I need to stop eating so much! But I really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when I say I don't like being so skinny? Skinny people always get teased. I want to weigh at least 000, and since I have come to college I weigh 0 pounds more. 000. ok my time is almost up. YAYYYY now all I have left to do is read and finish my application. Oh man. I have to get my shot tomorrow! 
__label__label0 Okay, I am writing this thing called stream ORGNAME consciousness writing. I find it hard to type right now. I don't know if I should follow proper grammar. My PROPNAME firewall just detected another blocked intrusion. I don't like this. Annoying hackers. Why don't they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me. I have 0 roommates and they are all good except for one. He is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners. He watches TV loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep. He even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it. That is so annoying and I can't stand it right now. My goodness, it has only been 0 mins? I've been writing a lot of things already. My arms are hurting because I can't type for so long and I hate typing. I'm not a typer, my brother and cousin are flawless typers but I am not. I already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me. I want to destroy this key board. I want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy. This is really annoying me. I want to take the psych research right now but I can't because I am not 00 yet. That is a load of bullshit if u ask me. can't it be 00? What is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months?? A few months of extra knowledge??? I don't think so. I hate my birthday, there is also a math midterm on my birthday, hooray for me. how nice, what a nice birthday gift. I have a tendency to measure how much I type. I always limit myself and not going to much bec. I always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and I am very lazy so I will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved. Like this writing assignment right now, if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal, I will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 00 minutes of my time doing nothing but write, senseless writing. And I ate writing, I hate the damn typo errors, I hate now typing fluidly like others, I hate making mistakes, I hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers! I hate this activity. I am not in a very good mood right now, I kind of understand that, I wonder why? Is it my roommate? maybe, is it this senseless activity? maybe. maybe its because ORGNAME of ORGNAME has cut my freaking internet, no I can't download beyond 0 gigs. nooo bec. u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others. What do I say? I say to hell with the others, what do they care if they don't really use the internet in the first place. They are just wasting bandwidth on nothing. This is just pathetic. You guys are afraid of the recording companies, the ORGNAME or something like that. That's what you are. Afraid. Why don't you just leave us alone like other schools? They have FREE internet, not this cheap limited "u have to pay" for internet. I am just ranting away all my frustrations on this thing aren't I? I hope no one reads it, if u do. the hell do I care! Damn it. College life sucks. To much reading. Everyone expects you to read all the chapters and expect you to understand the next day during the lecture. Well, tough luck, we are not that smart. Some people do well in lectures and some do well with books. Some people just can understand with the book so why do u pick on us?? Everything you test should be on your lectures. The book is just for bringing your knowledge of the subject to a more concrete manner. Lectures are what really is important, and you just read the book to review. You don't test what u do not teach in lectures!! Thank God I only have a few more minutes left. My fingers are burning now. I cannot be stuck doing the same thing for prolonged periods of time. It is just not right. It is so boring. Funny though. if u come to think of it. Ironic. I cannot stand doing a same thing for so long but I can stand doing nothing for so long. What kind of person am I? Indolent. Lazy. Pathetic. That's what I am. A person who does not want to leave his little protective sphere. a controlled sphere. I am afraid to do things with risks, I will never succeed in life like that. Doomed not to be a leader. 
__label__label1 I hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed. I'm such a slow typer. Maybe I should take some sort of remedial typing course. I wonder if they have those at LOCNAME. It's weird how stressful this is I have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that I'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. The copying machine behind me is irritating, I wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though I've only been here for ten minutes. Has it only been ten minutes?  Damn, I have to be in here for at least another ten. I'm so hungry, I wonder what I should eat when I'm done with this. For me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food. I don't have much money and I certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen. Whenever I get hungry I have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen. I miss PROPNAME food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student ID I could eat as much as I wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed. I should make more friends who live on campus so I can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food. Wow, my twenty minutes are up. 
__label__label1 Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 00 minutes. But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy PROPNAME was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put "so anyways" instead of "so anyway" I think that sounds as dumb as "laters" when one really means "later". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. Within reason that is. so anyway. I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted. I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. I am so proud of myself lately. I am being such a good girl. Although my habit of exercising everyday at 0 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at PROPNAME's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway. I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. I'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. I have been developing such good habits. I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early. O shit. I just got a little flash of procrastination. That sneaky devil. NO GO AWAY!!!. I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. I just don't have the time for that. I run every day . Mon-thurs. 0 miles a day. plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. Damn that dinner. UGH. What else do I do. O yea. I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too. I haven't been drinking. I haven't been too flakey. With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. Anyway we are good terms at the present. I'm being a pretty good daughter. I finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. I want to write about something cool. No luck. I really want to join the p0 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes. Bad flutes in lol. I'm probably really bad by now. I wonder if there is practice rooms around. I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. And then I would act all shy and innocent. It's just how I act. Natural reflex to wanted attention. Sometimes I think I'm so stupid. And then they would flatter me and ask me out. And I would act like I wasn't really sure. I little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you. 
__label__label1 I am overwhelmed with lots of work. Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way. I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session. I need to call PROPNAME and see if he wants to go see PROPNAME in College Station this Sunday. I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in LOCNAME and spend time with PROPNAME and study Saturday. I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that. The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns. Last year they would start the mowers at 0 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me. There is a party on 0th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going. I don't want PROPNAME to go to that party in LOCNAME LOCNAME because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable. This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party. That sounds a little bit like high school to me. The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far. I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak. There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk. We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves. I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature. They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words. I  love PROPNAME PROPNAME, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says " oh, their just words". Its great, I love it. I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss PROPNAME at home. I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies. I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you. I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own. Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy. I hate this place so much sometimes. there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me. Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it. It is so old fashioned. I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades. yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester. I had a full day of academics. I started around 0 and didn't finish till around 00, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep. But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore. I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know. I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while. I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself. Last year I gained like 0 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it. I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger. I wont go home until ORGNAME v ou so I won't get it until then, damn. I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 00's and 00's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me. Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 0 or something, that would be nice. 
__label__label1      last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 0 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 00 hours but I'm just taking 00, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank PROPNAME center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el PROPNAME. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 0 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that. 
__label__label1      This is kind of new and interesting. I have never done my homework like this before. I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment. Psychology is such an interesting field to study. It is my major in fact at this moment. I don't know if I will change though. The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder. With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything. I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer. I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together. I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. A dark haired man just sat near me. He didn't sit at the computer directly near me. I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really. People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway. For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. He wasn't very charming. That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't. He really isn't my type. He is in the business school. Ehh. I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'. Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money. People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner. I was that poor. I think it is because of this, I tend to value education. I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. That to me  
__label__label1      I hate walking all over the place at this school. My calves are going to double in size and they already don't fit into boots When I jumped horses I had to buy custom made boots so that my calves could fit into them. My mom has big calves too. Maybe it runs in the family. I don't really now anything else about calves. Weird thing to talk about probably, but mine really hurt right now beacuse of all the walking. It seems like everyplace I have to go is all the way across c ampus. Oh well. walking will probably be good for me. Maybe with all the walking I could loose some weight and make my ex-boyfriend wish that he didn't break up with me. Maybe I'll dye my hair red too. He'd like that. Ha Ha Ha. I think my hair would look good red. I think I should dye it but I hear a lot of people say don't do it. I think I should. Sonce I'm so pale I would like to have some depth. I feel like my blonde hair washes me out. I feel like I'm PROPNAME. Short choppy sentences merely stating what's going on around him. His short choppy sentences had deep meaning though. I wonder if my sentences have any deep meaning. Probably not since I have been talking about calves and hair. So it goes. I think about a lot of things. Sometimes I think so much that I can't fall asleep at night. When that happens I spray some stuff that smell like lavender on my pillows and fall right asleep. Lavender smells so good. I also like that color. It might be my favorite. I don't know because I like really deep eggplant. Yeah. Eggplant it pretty, not a very good looking vegetalbe however. Good color bad vegetable. They don't taste very good either. I don't like many vegetables. I like good that makes you fat. It just tastes better. My mom always yells at me when I eat fatting food. Sometimes when I just eat I get look. I miss my mom. I miss my car. I wish I could go get in my car and blare the stereo and smoke. That would be great. It really gets all the stress out. I love doing that. I miss my car. I also miss my cats, my friends, my ex. When I see happy couples I want to throw rocks at them. I don't but it frustrates me when I see how happy I used to be with another person, but in someone else. Then I start to think of him and I get sad. Oh good this is almost over this was harder than I thought. Trying to type really slows down your thinking. But perhaps I am just a slow typer. I probably should have learned how to properly type when I was a kid. I just didn't think it was important then. They should have a service like maids who come to your house and type stuff for you. Another thing I wish I would have done is learn to play an instrament. There is something so refined about a woman who can play an instrament. There is also something very attractive about a guy who can play something, guitar, piano and whatnot. Very cool. Maybe beacuse they seem more sensative. That is very important. Oh good 00 seconds Yeah!! I have so much more to do tonight. 
__label__label1 I need to get out more. I work all the time and go to school, and leaves so little time forme. Both of my parents a sick and living at home was kind of already planed. It makes you a stronger person to get stuck doing the stuff I do, but I wonder what it would be like to be normal. What it would be like to be selfish or not even selfish,but to not have so many people relie on me. I want to meet boys and just hang out, but I'm so shy. I think I look ok, but is ok enough? I'm 00 years old and one guy has approched me with saying something to make me mad. A lot of my frinds insted of being happy for me are so negative. We are no dating, I've never been on a date, so should be single for ever. I miss steven, but should I he's been sent overseas probably to fight. I only knew him for a few days and then he got his orders to leave. He gave me his phone number, but I can't call him. 
__label__label0      Well, this is interesting. Let's see. right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really. PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more. studious than what I'm doing. But I don't mind. Let's see. my hands have been smelling kind of funny. Like rust, almost. But I haven't touched anything rusty. Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves. Other than that, I don't really smell anything. God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now. I really want to eat. I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now. But no, I have to be a "conformist" and go when all my other friends are going. Now I have to pay for my food. And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying. Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience. I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum. Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room. We had it set at level 0, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk. Man, that was weird. I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps. The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 0, and their food is fine. Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination. Anyway. what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy. Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it. No, not that kind of sleepy. It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms. Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness. Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today. I'm so proud of my productivity today. After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my ORGNAME application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework. That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes. I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron. Whoa. Sometimes I think I work too hard. I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of. Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes. Man, I need to spit out this gum. It's like I'm chewing rubber or something. And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten. I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more. Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying. They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology. Here's the funniest one: "penia" means abnormal reduction. So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha. I can't help it, I'm still immature. Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it. But you must admit, that's a good way to remember "penia", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term. Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning. Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at ORGNAME. Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today. I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend. Let's see. six more minutes. Sorry, but I am counting down. Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent. I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy. Yes, petty jealousy. Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human. But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that. Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window. Did you know that dogs sleep about 00 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury. Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury. I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm. Or perhaps they were already warm. who knows. I definitely don't. Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time. I need to go to sleep. But no, it's only six in the evening. Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here. Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. and dream. I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams. Or maybe I don't want that. Who knows what would turn up. 
__label__label0      I love my girlfriend leah. She is so awesome. I love her big butt and her hair, I love her tongue and her smile. Man oh man does she give good hand jobs. Almost as good as sex. ALMOST. there are some things I don't like about her though. She is a tiny bit chubby but it doesn't really bother me that much. She is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves. I also worry that she is a shopaholic. and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income. I wonder what I will be doing 0 years from now. it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj. I think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time. I believe that would be best, cause then I could stay up late still and sleep in a little later. the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too. I would have fun being the dj in the morning, but I would hate the hours. I mean whoa, not my kind of lifestyle. I also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out. I haven't been really an active gym goer. I need to start doing that. I am trying to think of what would be a good time to go. on mondays I could go right after class at 0, same thing goes for wednesdays. on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays, I should probably go right after Spanish, because then after I am done I could go eat something, that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that I wouldn't have to eat before I go to Spanish then. I could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday, Wednesday and friday. and then weight train on tuesday and Thursday. maybe I should do the opposite. cause then I could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out, plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time. now about tennis. I really hope I can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice. I should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things I need to do. it would be cool if leah and sara came to UT next year, unfortunetly I don't see that happening when it comes to leah. I wonder how long I should wait before proposing. I think waiting til at least my junior year would be best. because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship. I mean two years is a long time to be with someone, and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together. no wait they were actually 0. 0 years I think, maybe 0. 0 when he asked and 0. 0 before marriage, I don't know, whatever it is. the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money. I could probably go back to ORGNAME cause I mean they don't pay that poorly. possibly even be a CCM or something so that I could bring a little extra dough in. I would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station. I wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show. I should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if I could get some kind of spot in there. even if it wasn't a show, but a technical thing. okay so when it comes to homework what should I do so that I have somewhat of a schedule. if I sleep in the mornings, or at least plan to, I don't think I should try scheduling that in. what I should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure I get hw done first before I do anything else. because then I could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldn't be too bad. cause that's probably my problem, the fact that I don't go to sleep early enough. I want to go to midnight rodeo this Saturday, I just wish roger creager wasn't playing there. remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later. back to study. monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all I have is my writing class EASY, and Spanish, so getting out late on those days isn't too bad. Tuesdays and thursdays I should try to make sure I am done with hw by like 0, cause then I could go eat after I did my hw. that's a pretty good plan. only on occasions should I change that up. what I mean by that is like being invited to do stuff, never let it be online poker or TV that distracts me, that includes playing xbox. even if I think I have had a hard day so far, just think how more satisfying that resting will be once I have everything done, I mean knowing u don't have anything left to do is a nice feeling. this writing this is going by faster than I thought. I didn't know I had all this stuff on my mind. I think it would be nice to have a 0pac on my body, and some muscle. you know, it really does kind of upset me that leah doesn't want me hanging out with females alone. I find that it shouldn't matter. I mean on one hand I know her past, and I don't want to upset her on something as small as this, but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal. maybe I should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this. HOPEFULLY we can compromise. I am kind of tired but I really do need to study for Spanish quizzes tomorrow, and I should look over chapter 0 for this class. I wonder when the first test is, I think it is on the 00th. that's coming up pretty soon. I should look at that handbook thing I have on sample test questions on this friday. along with that I could reread philosophy and study some more Spanish, and go to a seminar for writing class. this was kind of a fun thing to do. I kind of like having a diary like this, helps me think clearly. 
__label__label0      I am finally taking a break from doing my math homework. I am so excited to finally be doing nothing. I am so excited that I finally got my laundry back because now I do not have to worry about it, but I do need to do a load of some personal items. While looking around my room I see my side pretty neat and then I look at my roommate's side and it is a pig-sty. It bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere, when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed. Maybe we will have a talk about that later?  Who knows. But I cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend, but that's one more day that I don't have to go to class. I love living here at Towers but the walls are paper thin. I can hear anything and everything that my roommate/suitmate say and sometimes that's okay but when I'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me. Oh well, life could be worse. I wonder what else I have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow?  I think I need to go to PROPNAME's room at some point to get her notes from Philosophy that I missed last week, and I really need to go return a book to the Co-Op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad's name on it. Why would they do such a thing?  Oh well at least it won't be too hard to fix. At least I hope it won't be too hard to fix. I am so tired but I got so much sleep last night and I don't understand how I'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today? It makes no sense to me. Maybe I am still transforming into the "college-life-style" and I'm just not used to it yet?  I'm getting very sleepy but there's no point in trying to take a nap because I know it won't happen for me. I love how I have so many pictures around my room because everywhere I look I am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home. Speaking of home, I feel like so many people are going home this weekend. As much as I would like to go home, I don't think I'm quite ready to leave here yet. I don't think I'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already. Even if I did go home my parents wouldn't be there because they are going to the lake. I wonder if I will see them at all since they'll be so close to me now?  Maybe I will call them later and ask. Oh and I need to call PROPNAME back since she left me a message yesterday. I'll call her later when I have a few minutes to spare since I know the conversation will last for a lifetime. Or I guess I should say it will last for a long time. It's amazing how I was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and I'm left alone again in quietness. I will most definitely take advantage of that alone/quiet time, but then again sometimes I do get bored sitting here by myself. They asked me if I wanted to go eat with them but I just ate a few hours ago, I might as well save my meals for when I'm actually hungry right?  Wow, looking up at the clock I never realized how long twenty minutes really is. I feel almost out of breath because I've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes. My  sister just called but I have to call her back. She didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend PROPNAME would be searching for PROPNAME's car anyway. So I wonder what happened to it?  Did she park somewhere and forget where she left it?  Weird. I hope I never do that. Although it would probably be hard for me to do that since I've only driven my car twice in two weeks. I wonder if that's bad for it?  Maybe I need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works?  I should probably ask my dad about that. So its only four oclock in the afternoon and I feel like its ten at night. Why is that?  Well I just hope I keep up with everything as much as I'm "supposed" to because college is definitely not like high school. High school is like a joke compared to what I've experienced in only 0 days. Oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks. So about winter break. I cannot wait to go home because I think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again. I'm sure Ill see most of my friends over Thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the "old gang" will probably be Christmas break. That will be a fun break, and I know it will be great seeing everyone again. I wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip?  Hmmm there's another thing I need to check into because I don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute. Especially since my best friend who lives in LOCNAME will be in LOCNAME for part of the break. If I missed her because I was on a family trip I would be extremely upset so I need to figure it out to make sure I will be around. Wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe I should go get some coffee from downstairs? Sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it's kind of of sore. I think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather. I can't wait to fully recooperate so I can feel 000% again. Then hopefully I will be in a better mood and not so irritable?  Hopefully!  Well now getting back to the matter at hand, this assignment. ALthough it has been time consuming, it's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life. Wow and that's saying a lot!!!  I am so interested to see what our next assignment is like, since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again. Our class is huge and I actually saw a second person that I know yesterday when I was walking out. Speaking of I should probably call that friend of mine. Well it looks to me that I just glanced up and this assignment is over! Yay :-) 
__label__label1 I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can. It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 0000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 000 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 0 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 00's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 0 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 0. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old. I'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since I won't be there for her all the time. I've had her ever since I was little, I miss her too. I brought a lot of pictures and things from home so I wouldn't get homesick. my room is very comforting I think. I don't think I could stand it if it were blank. most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly. she goes to corpus with my brother, so she isn't that far away from me. we talk all the time online though, so it feels like she's here.      
__label__label1  I am so happy I can't really explain how I feel just that I am feeling great. I know the reasons why I am so happy I just feel like telling everyone that I am so happy and I just want to smile a lot. I would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in LOCNAME that I don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. Anyways I have had so many hard days these past days butI think that I am going to be okay. I don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. Today I actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university I can make others see me. Okay right now my feet hurt so much I did so much walking today just like the other days. The difference is that I got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. Anyways I think I have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when I bought them. Which is good because I usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. Oh if I misspell a word I am so sorry but its just that when I am happy I can't really concentrate on spelling. I'll try not to make so many mistakes. I have gone back and captalized all the I's that weren't captalized. Right about now I feel my brain fried of so much thinking. So I met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but I can't say who he is. Besides that I am really happy I feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. All this happiness is thanks to God because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. So thank you so much Jesus because without you I would not be were I am today and who I am. I know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how I feel and what I am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. I so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase I have her in my heart and in a DVD that my sister made for her. So any time I want to hear my mom's voice I just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. I wish I could describe this feeling and share it with every one but I can't. It's great! Anyways my minutes are almost up but after this I am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. I usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. One teacher told me that if I wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them.   
__label__label0      I'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because I attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 00:00. very ironic. I feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. I have a lot to do and I don't feel like doing anything. I wish I could just go to sleep. I need a lot of attention from people these days and I'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and I'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe I'm just overreacting though, because I seem to do that so well. I don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and I smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. I have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 0. I don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully I will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. I need to realize that I can make myself happy and I don't need someone else to make me happy. I don't even know why I'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head I suppose. I hope I get a new car. my dad said I can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. It will probably be something crappy like I have now. but I can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue I was starting to stress that I was going to get too far behind. I really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though I do try but I need more. I need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that I might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. I might stay at the appartment tonight but I probably won't because I have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens I suppose. I think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like I said I'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. I'm so tired right now I could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but I can't do that because I have entirely too much work to do. tonight I want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and I want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. I hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but I'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. I'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. I don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. I just hope it counts to him. oh well. I met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and I hope I get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. I'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san PROPNAME and go see some people that I haven't seen in a long time. I hope I can scrounge up something to wear, because I need to do laundry and I need to go shopping,  I have like no clothes anymore, I don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if I see her this weekend. I hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. I don't know what but I don't really like it. I'd rather just stay here and study or like watch TV then go home and feel awkward with my family. I have so much to do and I'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. I can already see that college is going to be very hectic. I hope I can handle it alright. wow the time is up. 
__label__label0 ahh everyting I typeed got erased dammit I have to do this again. htat is not fair I am angry now, with 00 seconds left somehow everything I typed about got erased. that is very frustrating for me I typed about so many random things. let me try this again. First of all I talked about how I am leaving for LOCNAME in the mornging. I have a flight at 0 oclock which means I have to leave my house at 000 in the mornign so I can get there half an hour before my boarding of my flight. my dad is going to take me to the airport so I odnt have to leave my car there. I have not seen my car in two weeks and I love my car. I bought the car with my own money and I paid for it for one whole year. now my dad pays for it and is thaankful that I atleast got about 00000 dollars out of the way of the payments. I bought my car on august 00 0000 and to celebrate my two year anniversary I ended up having to get my wisdom teeth pulled. it was actuall fun for me. I loved the laughing gas, it made me so goofy I amde so many jokes with my partetns and with my docotors. I also couldnot stop laughing. also I did not feel any pain but still took pain killers to make sure that the pain didn't kick in. lets see what else can I talk about. hmm. I am waiting for my shoes to get mailed in to my house. I ordered some nike shox which I got to customize the color and also got to write my nAME ON IT. oops I had caps lock on. that is wiered, I am still mad that my whole assignment got erased right before it was twenteyy miutes. oh well htere is always things runnging around in my mind. if I am ever bored I turn to sports. I love sports. I love ut sports and all of dallas' temas. I will support them 000 percent everrytime. most of the time my TV is on I watch espn, it is an awesome channel, okay it has benn twenty minutes of typing for me so I am goign to go pack for my trip. hopefully I can get an A in this class. and I love this assignment 
__label__label0      oh boy, the first writing assignment. I hope I am doing this correctly. I can't really think of anything else right now. I sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. I am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can I say. I am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. I don't know what I feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so I guess its a little warm in here. I can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. I guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 00 min of writing sure will suck. well, I still don't know what to think. I'm still bored. I'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company I enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and I occasionally see her on the weekends, although I've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now I'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. I'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but I think I had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when I when I bought it using his credit card account. I guess I thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but I ignored his call because I am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, I like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy I know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although I'm a passivist, I hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. I thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, I think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. I wonder how they're doing. its been a while since I last talked to almost any of them, and I just wonder how they're doing. maybe I should go up there sometime. although I have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another  seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. I'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now I'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. I think his parents weren't too happy about it, because I've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but I ignored his call as well. now I'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy I've know for almost 00 or 00 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. I'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase I know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although I'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, I know he'll be happy, and for that reason, I too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, I hope that this will end soon. and now I see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and I, which I don't thin she should do. I think I'll stop her when I'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till I'm done. yippie. 
__label__label1      I havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time. I do that though, I have a journal and its handy. I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves. Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal. I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. PROPNAME calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. That reminds me of PROPNAME, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. PROPNAME makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. I am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. He is such a confusing boy. I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know. grr. that's a noise I make, I make many of them. I make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. I just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. I wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man I was wrong. I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now I miss them a lot. I was listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME and she has a song called nobodys home. and I realized that I have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 0 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do. I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said I was an ESTP? I think. anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think. I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap. PROPNAME is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry. and still when I think about it I get angry at her. why not at him? I don't get that. but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew. I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things. like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just. didn't. and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative. PROPNAME's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one. I don't know how much they'll cost either. I think $000 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one. I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic. I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but I said that once and she said no way. whatev. I'm tired. I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 000 I think. I don't remember exactly but 0 or less hours of sleep sucks. and I've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job. and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum. I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go. and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go. I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 00 min were up a few sentences ago. 
__label__label0      Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far. Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade. Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe. I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends. At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town. Good old LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there. My roommate is also from LOCNAME LOCNAME the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on. Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well. Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt. Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there. But well back to my life in college. I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it. Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper. Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP. This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend PROPNAME showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at ORGNAME's. Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and PROPNAME didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 0 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in. So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town. I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit. When I was there it was fun the first couple of 00 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates. But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose. My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving. Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give. The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast. And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer. 
__label__label0      I'm home. wanted to go to bed but remembered that I had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week. Maybe this wouldn't take that long. I can handle this. Something is making a noise in the restroom. Did I turn on the fan? I got to write more. This is harder than I thought. I'm not thinking anything. Was I always like this when I didn't have anything to do? Should I go to bed after finishing this assignment or should I stay awake. I think I had an appointment with someone. Or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in. Is there any assignments besides this. My roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now. Wonder what he did with it. I'll ask him when he comes back. My eyes hurt. I should really do something about my glasses. When should I go fix it. ? Feel tired. I should really go to bed. Only 0 minutes passed. Half way done. Wonder if I can just stop here. Maybe not. Hm. let's see. What am I thinking? Wow my feet are covered with dirt. Amazing I didn't notice that until now. How did I get this on my legs? I want to wash it off but I'll wait until this assignment is over. 0 minutes to go. What are my parents doing anyway? Hope they're doing fine. When would they be able to receive the email I sent few minutes ago. Anyways, I feel like I really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was. Guess I'll figure it out after taking a nap. Am I still not there. Never knew how long a 00 minute could be. Thirsty. No water around. Now I'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make. Time is almost up. 
__label__label0 It is Wednesday, December 0th and a lot has been going on this semester. I am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go. although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive, I know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school. the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class. with two test left, there was still a chance to make an A or B in the class which was expected. it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well, the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an A or B to get simply trying to get a C and pass. granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 00 different assignments and three test, it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left. the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to A's and a B's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an A on the other. My only focus has been on the two exams on Saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered. all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right. doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues. It seems as though just when I try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up. this semester the fact that I was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something I did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but I still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation. next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a's which is very possible for me to achieve. Making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now. all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong. all I can do is my best the rest is out of my hands. I have to do something to make it easier for my parents. 
__label__label1 I have just gotten off the phone with brady. I'm trying to decide what exacly we will do  this weekend. he wants to go to a hotel, but I know I have to babysit and I'm not sure exactly  how I will tell my dad to pick us up from here. My birthday is this weekend, and it doesn't really  even feel like it. I don't really mind, but I have a feeling PROPNAME probably won't do much for it. I  almost feel like I'm always doing something for him. I should, I really care about him. He says  he will pay for the hotel, but I don't really want that for my birthday. I'ts just not htat important  to me. I feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the TIP program. I know that  sometimes I have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand. I haven't heard  from my mom so I'm not sure if she's mad at me or not. She probably doesn't care, but when  she does find out she will freak. I wish PROPNAME would pay more attention. He tries so hard, but it  doesn't seem like he has the chance to do so. I need to work out. I'm feeling that although I  don't weigh that much my weight is getting out of control. Perhaps I'm overreacting. PROPNAME  and I went shopping yesterday. I really don't plan on shopping anymore. Yikes. We don't really  need anything anyways. I need a strapless bra though. I'm surprised I didn't get one. oh well. I wish I could figure out what to do on Friday with PROPNAME. I want PROPNAME to be able to hang out  with us too. He's concerned that I tell her too mucha bout our personal life, but I really don't. PROPNAME kind of pisses me off. Why is everyone so negative about a caring relationship?  She's  probably just jealous, she hasn't been able to keep a guy at all for a long time. I'm concerned  for her because I don't want her to be doing drugs anymore, but she probably is. She has too much  sex too. lol. It's hard to not be concerned with what your friends are doing. PROPNAME is  surprisingly very understanding to everything that's going on in my life. She's caring and funny  to be around. I wasn't sure what to expect since she's friends with PROPNAME, PROPNAME etc. They  apparently aren't waht I expected them to be. They play if off to be all God-like, when in all  realtiy they judge pretty much everyone. I don't think that is right. Although I'm not that  religious, I do care about God and don't think that those kinds of behavior are fair. I'm looking  att he picture of PROPNAME and me. PROPNAME was kind of weird about the whole boyfriend thing. I hope  that brady and I last. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with him. I care about  him so much, and the distance hurts. I think it isi probably for the best though. I can't imagine  having to go to school with him. His roommates aren't as crazy as I thought, but bad enough. I  jut hope that he doesn't get heavy into drinking,a nd I don't assume he will. PROPNAME is a bitch, I  can't believe she comes off like taht. ugh, it really bothers me. I wonder what it's like at home  without me there. My mom is making a big deal about me not calling, but in all honesty I just  don't care. I don't know why I'm so unfeeling lately. It's probably because I'm about to start my  period. maybe I'll skip it this month, in fact I probably will. I don't usually have allergies, but for  some reason my eyes keep tearing. It's either my contacts or allergies. I just changed my  contacts though. I really have to pee. The eyes watering is a little embarrassing. Sometimes I  wish I coiuld do more. I kind of wish I woul dhave rushed to be in a sorority. I feel as though I  ahve no friends because I have lost them to brady. Should I go to florida with my parents during  spring break or should I spend time with PROPNAME instead?  Maybe I could make money  babysitting. That would be nice. I hope my parents aren't mad because I want to babysit on  Saturday instead ofdoing my birthday thing. I don't see why it would be that big of a deal, but  apparently it is. I kind of want to go tanning, but it's not good with my current skin situation and  whatnot. that reminds me of richard rush. I wonder how he is doing. Spoiled brat. I'm really  hungry too. I'm not sure what I'm going to eat, but I wish PROPNAME would get here so taht we can  go eat. That would be really good. lol. I'm hoping that I won't look old when I'm 00 or so. Heck, I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I almost feel as though if I marry PROPNAME  will accomplish everything. I want so badly to be with him forever. NO one understand me like  he does. I wish I had saved myself for him, like he did for me. How is he able to only commit  to me?  I must care about him so much that he feels like he should. I'm glad that I've gotten to  know hhis family a lot better. his mom is honestly really nice to me, and I don't ahve a problem  with her anymore. It would be awesome to be ilke paris hilton. She's has it really good. I  wonder what it would be like if my parents lived more like they should. They are always trying  to save money when in reality being multi-millionaires does not mean that you should only do  that. Perhaps it's a shock from the inheritance or something. I don't know. It's confusing to  me. Ok, this is getting old. I'm a little tired of writing. It's probably because I'm hungry. I'm a little  confused as to what I should study here at school. I've had an interst in psychology, but do I  really want to do that for the rest of my life. I know it doesn't just end here, but I feel as though  there aren't many options when it comes to what I can do with my life. yay, kristen got back and  we can go eat now. My time is almost over. I'm about to pee in my pants too. AHHHHH!!!!! some people try to hard 
__label__label1 I'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing. I don't know why I was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because I'm subconsciously afraid of what I'd write. But my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 00 minutes and I'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm already typing more coherently than I thought I was going to (caffeine, maybe? Doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 0:00 already. If I get to the cafeteria too early I'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because I ignored the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME schedule. I guess I'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from LOCNAME. Roommate's explaining The ORGNAME to suitemate right now. His music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety. I've heard PROPNAME PROPNAME and uhhhhh Young Buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me. I was expecting my writing to be more PROPNAME-like; that's a great book: I even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that I did at home, either) There's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like PROPNAME PROPNAME, down to the facial hair and everything. God he's annoying, sucking up to PROPNAME PROPNAME and asking questions that --- A nerf basketball just hit me. Damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious. Not that I have anything against him for looking like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I picked my glasses because they looked PROPNAMEan (My dad has the same glasses as PROPNAME PROPNAME). The tiny old Vietnamese woman (0:00) at my optometrists (all the employees have been Vietnamese. Ong, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, &c. ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'. It sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy. (0:00)  Suitemate probably thinks I'm vaguely antisocial because I'm typing furiously instead of playing Nerf basketball with him and my roommate. The ball just went under my bed; there, he got it. Missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again. I was tempted to bring ummmmm not Ulysses. PROPNAME's Wake (no apostrophe, I remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that I already have too lofty of literature here (I was afraid of seeming to effete if I was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from College Station, but it's fine) but I already have enough unread books on my shelf. Not that I don't intend to read it all sometime. Last time I checked I was on page 000 which I think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all. Somewhere I read that Joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision. which would make PROPNAME happy. It's funny what you learn from ORGNAME ORGNAME. Apparently the record at shots at the Nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 0. Or maybe 0. Maybe PROPNAME made 0 and PROPNAME 0? I wasn't really paying attention, but  Ooh, my sister just signed onto AIM. We need to try that LOCNAME restaurant on 00th sometime. I occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that I'm paying attention to their little basketball game PROPNAME made 0 now. PROPNAME's trying from distance, missed. Standing right next to me, apparently I'm 0 point range. When I grow up I bet I'll have to patronize my kids similarly. 00:00 I can eat before too terribly long, then I'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar  PROPNAME just backed into me. Ewww This 00 cent song is so violent. At first I thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy. 00:00  He's putting the Onion volume 00 back on my shelf, upside down. They're leaving for dinner, asked me if I wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment. He doesn't think he like's quesadillas. They're ok, but I prefer them without too much stuff in them. Which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that. So I'll be down in a few seconds. unless the elevators take too long which they do. What else. AIM. Got my course packets today. IT was easier to find but PROPNAME's I had to search for.  DONE! 
__label__label1 So school has been interesting so far. I've come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like, and I've surprised myself to find that it would be completely different. At the time, I have become increasingly known by a nickname that wasn't even self imposed, I've created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to. People love "dat PROPNAME PROPNAME" but hey. I guess I'm not too mad about it. it's good in the end, in some ways, and in some ways not. like for example, if I want people to know who I am, then they really do know who I am, and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way, but on the other hand, since people think they know who I am they won't bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who I am. really who am I anyway?  can it be defined by a label or name?  does it matter if I am PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME, or PROPNAME Boi Tony. because some people can remember my name at all. I guess in some facets it really is irrelevant, but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant. lol. it's like significance drives us, like a since of purpose, much like Agent PROPNAME from the Matrix, but that movie was flawed in itself. It had no purpose. It started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end,  but that just didn't work. However PROPNAME PROPNAME, did it right when I he made PROPNAME PROPNAME,  it was a simple plot with a unique character development, and that was the important part. many people thought that it was the action, but it truly was the characters that made the movie. that's why vol. 0 is better than vol. 0, no matter what the next person tells you. sure vol. 0 was composed of the best action sequences since the old PROPNAME PROPNAME days (who is still better than PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME), but the story itself is what should draw you. on another note, a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see, and now he's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care. The problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind, but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature. he can't take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself, the thinks he is fine as who he is. Emo SUX though. I had no formulated opinion about it until I seen what it is doing to him. he needs help. for real. the funniest part about it, is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting PROPNAME. "God is Dead. "  which is a very interesting quote. a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion. if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason. they are a tool, if they inject reason and use logic to prove why God is alive. then they are less of one. the point is, that the religious texts, such as the Koran, the Bible, etc. were written by man (inspired by God), which means they are subject to flaws. inherently and maybe intentionally,   if you could tell the people "thus said the lord" and you didn't want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish. then that's what you'd tell them. after all some people read from texts translated by PROPNAME. but I digress. I as a ORGNAME would only have this much to say in return. if God is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed. And if he truly is God and did exist,  Death has no binding power. defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic. What is death, what is death to a man, what is death to a beast, what is death to a god. And then I would say. yes, God in the form of man (Jesus) did die, for you and I. there's always a way to explain something in the logical realm, however some people are too closed minded to see even that. Sometimes, philosophy, even pomo philosophy, can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe. and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory. that persons faith has become that much stronger. Well. yester I went to a labor day cookout. and there were some fine ladies there. You never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you. that's the funny part about it all, I don't try that hard enough. I just wonder what other people's perception is of me. could I have had a chance with any of those girls, probably, but not likely. and this is where my reckoning begins. what are these girls looking for. attention? relationships?  or just good sex?   I could provide them with all 0, but hey there's only a small amount of me to go around. all jokes aside, with the truth being told, I really think attention is the centric thing that girls want. how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story, because girls are all so different. but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail. and I like to look at detail. that's why I think I might be staying single for a while. even as hard as that is in a place like ORGNAME ORGNAME.
