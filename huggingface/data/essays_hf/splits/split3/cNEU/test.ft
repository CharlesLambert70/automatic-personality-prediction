__label__label0 The day is over again and still so much to do and to think about. I hope my parents are settling down up in  LOCNAME with good business and a place to live. I hope no conflicts will occur although I know they are going to fight one in awhile. I miss my mom the most. she cried at the airport and I can still see those tears in her face. her voice was so weak when I called to say hello. is this it to college life? I wonder where PROPNAME is has he called me and left me a message? I have precal class with him first thing tomorrow morning and I don’t know where to go yet. I hope to get my beeper soon because I needed really bad and I don’t know when ill get it. as I look at the screen I wonder if the writing will ever go down onto the next line, or will it go on forever. I really want to go home  I feel as though I have to be with her 00/0 and I feel like she'll follow me everywhere I go. I don't want her to , but at the same time I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I hate it when she smokes she smelt so bad in the classroom wow it finally has moved down to the second line. this stream of conscious writing is kinda pain in the butt because it is nearly impossible to actually start typing without thinking about what to type. lookin at the screen uhhh she wants to come over today but I don’t want her to I feel as though she's gonna stick with me wherever I go and I feel like she's never gonna find a friend to hang out without me. but I shouldn’t think like this because she’s my friend and we've known each other forever. but I feel that she’s going to hold me back in the future as we go on. either that or we're gonna fall apart, not easily, but  I feel that someone’s gonna get hurt and I don’t want to be the one hurting her. my head itches. I gotta go home and call my mom and talk to my dad. I wish they had the same kind of water here as LOCNAME. their water is so nice. I would like to know if PROPNAME likes me or just as friends because he actually we act the same way towards each other but I don’t know if I like him or not so I wonder if he feels the same way. my pastor is here from LOCNAME to teach bible study and I kinda feel guilty because I said I’d see him and stuff when he is down here but I cant get my self to go and sit and listen to him. I feel bad. I wonder what lee is doing he seem so quiet yet outgoing but not really I would like to get to know him but I wonder if he even knows that I exist. I think he does but who knows. sitting here typing wondering what time it is . what can I eat for dinner? I have an eye appointment tomorrow and I want to meet PROPNAME somewhere so we can go to class together. cant wait to go home I’m kinda glad I didn’t room with her I can't imagine how hurt she'll be if she really knows how I feel. she gets on my nerves time to time and she asks me if she gets on my nerves, but I can never tell her that she does because I don’t think its right. I want my friends to come over to my apartment but I don’t know how my roommate is going to react. how am I suppose to find a roommate for next semester when she leaves . it almost time to go  I hope they don’t make us read this later on in the semester. I think I really want a boyfriend but not really, I don’t know what I want. PROPNAME is pretty cute only if he was taller I would fall for him so hard. but I’m glad we're good friends. I’m kinda glad that they broke up too. I think she’s too self fish and he can do so much better. I better memorize the medical terminology by Thursday. what should I do this weekend I bet she wants to come with me I feel as though every time I’m with her I’m blocked off from the crowd in a way I’m uncomfortable with her around other people. I wish she stop smoking she  looked so crappy up times up and I don’t feel like typing any more. 
__label__label1 The one thing that I miss here at school is my drums. I couldn't bring them with me to college because there is no where to put them. I used to play in a band and people used to tell me that I was really good but then I stopped playing and I got worse. When they were always there for me to play I never wanted to but now I wish I could play them more than anything. My best friend is a drummer but he always kept on practicing and he got really good. So good that now he is moving to LOCNAME to join a band. The band he is joining is pretty successful death metal band and they have two albums. I miss my friend and I hope that he is doing alright up there. He left all of his friends and family back in LOCNAME LOCNAME and he doesn't know anyone in LOCNAME except for his band members and he really doesn't know them too well. I wish I could go up and see him and watch his band play since I am a big fan of death metal music. I listen to all types of music but death metal is definitely one of my favorites. I don't like it when people talk bad about death metal when they don't even know anything about it. I want death metal artists to be able to someday get rich off there music like all of the other pop artists. Because the talent that comes along with death metal music is remarkable.  
__label__label0 well here I am sitting in front of this glowing monitor trying not to tell the editor in my head overtake me. It's more difficult than it seems but I must keep trodding. Shoot. I just realized I missed a club meeting tonight. I also remembered about the informal classes Ill be taking Monday. I should also be practicing guitar but I'm too lazy. (Homework for that matter)  Boy it's something else being 00 stories up. People look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. Now I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I feel sick from the food I ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. What else to say. . . . . I remembered I should call PROPNAME since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. Oh, and PROPNAME, well I need to inform him about the LOCNAME concert info. I wonder if those airline tickets to D. C. came in yet. And where are those items I ordered from the catalog?  I'm beginning to worry. I cant believe B of A charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an ATM. They also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an ATM. outrageous. I'm really looking forward to go back home soon. I'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. Looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that I bought Contact by PROPNAME PROPNAME, which I keep intending to read, but never get around to it. I hate that. Why did I buy the book?  Well I thought Contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. It's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. PROPNAME PROPNAME must have been a brilliant man. My next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. Hmm what song is that?. Oh yeah, semi charmed life. I should look for those guitar tabs later. That reminds me, should go to the party next door on Sat. or not?  I suppose it couldn’t hurt, but then I'd get further behind on my studies. How long have I been writing so far?  Hmm. almost 00 min. I haven't really said anything profound which disappoints me, but then again, this is a stream of consciousness assignment. I'm liking college a lot. It gives me space ponder and let my mind wander. It's amazing the places one can go if you just set your mind free. I don't know why, but sometimes I have an impulsive urge to write poems or songs, but once I get distracted from that sudden drive, I lose the will to do so. I guess I have to be in a certain mood. I noticed that I had mere frequent occurrences when I first got here. Perhaps it was due to the seclusion and sudden separation from friends and family. Being in a strange environment w/o a guardian is harder than I thought. I feel like I'm being forced to grow up faster than I'd like to. But I suppose it builds character, and I have never been one to back down from obstacles. Think of it as a gateway to another world. Hmm time's up. My train of thought has sure been a wacky one. Bunch of random thoughts strewn together.  does this represent a part of who I am?  certainly, but not hardly. maybe a paradox of some sort. one thought to add is that I have been such a weak willed person lately. I have those intentions, but I cant seem to get them to take root. That needs to change, and I guess I do notice a little improvement, but near as much as I'd like  
__label__label0 Well, here I go, writing for 00 minutes. This really feels weird, but I  guess I have to do it. Actually I am glad I am doing this assignment because I dreaded doing it and now I can get it over with. It's just that 00 minutes seems like such a long time to sit here and write about nothing. I just don't know what to do and I feel very uncomfortable. Hmmm. Princess PROPNAME died early this morning. I have felt so sad. When I first heard of her car accident last night I tried to pray for her, but I felt as she would not want to live but rather die. I have been reading and studying about near-death experiences and most people studied/interviewed have said that they usually do not want to come "back" after being pronounced dead. Anyway, I think she is in a better place, hopefully there will be no media hounding her wherever she is at now. The ceiling fan in this room bothers me when it is on high. Sometimes I'd rather be hot than have to hear the loud roaring noise. My dogs just came upstairs. I wonder what they are thinking about?  Do they think like we do?  What could be going through their minds?  I know I am supposed to write without worrying about grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. , but I do, and I try to correct everything as I go. I keep looking at the clock and time is going very slow. I notice we have two clocks now on the desk. One is new, a prize or rather a gift for purchasing something. This room has so many things in it. I wish it was a bigger room. I like spacious things, I hate to feel crowded. I seem to be complaining so much right now, I guess I am tired and a little sleepy, and get grumpy. Why do we have some many things!  So many papers, junk, wiries, toys things, things, things!  Do we need all these things?  Can we live without all this things?  Yes, we can! Thank God! I can't stop writing but I would like to. Oh well. I just thought about a bakery, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME bakery to be exact. I keep craving sweets, so maybe that is why. I saw a white cake with pink frosting. My sister also came to mind. Hmmm, this is interesting because she is a professional baker and creates luscious deserts!  It is so dark outside, I hate having the windows closed, I like to hear the outdoors. I love the outdoors. Oh God 0 more minutes of this. I just feel like my mind is completely empty right now. I wonder if this happens when one is really tired?  I feel very old today. I like this computer, I guess I am pretty lucky to own one. I'm sorry I have been so negative, but this is how I feel right now. However, my time is up , hip hip hooray! Bye!  
__label__label1 I kind of don't know what to write. I am sitting here next to a guy who knows just everything about computer. I feel like I am stupid cause my typing speed and I didn't even know how to get on UT web page. Oh well, I will learn how to do that later. that is why I am here. I really like computer, I learned a lot about it in past two months. I really hope I still have ORGNAME, so I can talk to some of my friends up there. I wrote like thousands of e-mails. But my e-mail box was empty. I can't believe it. Did all those friends of mine forget about me!!!!! Oh well! they are not really friends. I don't even know what they look like. I don't really care, but I like e-mails. I like getting attentions. =) I really miss my boyfriend. he is in LOCNAME, and I am going back tomorrow. Coming to college can be so much trouble. I hate facing problems on my own. I need someone like watch my back or something. I need my boyfriend's support. He can be so sweet sometime. he makes me forget all the problems. I always call him when I am in stress. taking to him makes me feel comfortable. Man! my phone bill is going to scare me. but I can't help to call him. he means a lot to me. he is black. My parents don't really know about him. I wonder what will happen if I tell them. Like all other Chinese parents, they probably kill me or something. I wish my parents understand, but I don't expect too much. I know how it is like. they don't really know much about other race. They didn't even like my exboyfriend, because he is half Vietnamese half white. I been typing for a long time, but there is like so little on the screen, oh well I am going to type a little longer. I wonder how does the instructor know how long did I write. is there is clock in this program or something. it like counts the how long I been writing. I am like so surprised myself, I am writing a home work on the day I got it. and the due day is like a month away or something. I need to study more in college. I wonder if I can. I am afraid to promise myself, cause I might not do it. oh well , let's see how things go. My life is so hard. I wish I can write like everyone else. I wish English was my first language. no I don't, I am happy I can speak two language, but it was so painful when I didn't know how to speak English. it will always be a scar for me, mentally I mean. I always talk about how hard it was. I don't know if people like to hear it. Man, this page is wide. Is there a way I can make it narrow. I been writing for so long. this thing is such a pain. but I know it is good for me. I can improve my writing or something, but it is for psychology class. Anyway, it is cool. ok, I been writing for a while, I think it is enough. I am gonna stop. okay bye, until next time. =)   gone sleeping =P 
__label__label1 Today was a good day I enjoy life. I wish I was at home with my girlfriend. she is so pretty I am in love yet it is not here. I wish that she could be here to join me. Frat life is demanding yet it should be a good payoff in the near future I wish I could sleep I am so tired that it is hard to stay awake at times during the day I really enjoy this kind valentine assignment it lets me express my true feelings  and thoughts with no real worries except that if it will arrive when it needs to. 00 minutes is a long time to write continuously but it really is neat to think off all the things that go on in my head. like home and vlentina. that is her name the lovely girl that I left back home when I came to college. I am scared that I will not do as well as I can I hope so I don’t want to let me dad down he is very important to me even though he is a bit scary at times. but that is how they are supposed to be right? oh well I hope my dog is doing ok I love her so my thoughts drift now into wanting to be on some other planet that is why I love astronomy. even thought it is kind confusing. but it is fun nonetheless I love to use the internet I think that it is so neat. I do however wish I could find a good use for it. all I ever do is waste time going from place to place not knowing where I am going. kinda like life we seem to wander from place to place and never seem to  truly settle down at least that is the way things seem right now in a few years  however I am sure that my opinion will change. I know that once I can complete college which is my number one goal above all else. then to have fun and party. I hope this week we will have a good party I know we will. we always have the best parties. and there  are always girls there. yet I do wish that valentina could be there. even though  she did start to bother me before I left. now it seems that we have gotten closer at the same time that we are apart. is she the girl for me? I do not know and whish  that I did. it seems that way at times. yet then at other times she just bugs me to death an \d all I can think of is getting away from her. I never want to loose her though. I do really care for her. I am looking forward to seeing here soon on my birthday she will stay with me I hope. but I will probably not see her that much since I am so  busy I guess I will just have to make the time to see her. I hope that she loves me I really do. I miss my parents and my old room. my room i\ here is great and I have  fun with my roommates all of whom are from my home in fort worth. so we get along well not like some of the girls that came here boy they cant stand each other and we have only  been here for 0 weeks. not even a full month. I cant believe I am writing this much I normally cannot write this much when working on a paper but now I can I guess I don’t really have to think about what I am writing just write it. I think that it is neat . wow that was a fast 00 minutes. I can't believe that it is over oh well I still have on more assignment to do. 
__label__label0 I wish it was Friday actually I wish it was next Friday then I would be going home vacuums really bug me I want to change the channel but I don't want to get up but duck tales really sucks and even though I’m not even watching it and just hearing it bugs me I guess that's something you just have to deal with if you're lazy I want to talk to PROPNAME but I don’t want to call him because I called last but he hasn't called me which really doesn't make much sense but guys don't make any sense anyway so its ok I don't want to go to calculus tomorrow but I should because I’ve already missed it twice I wish it would rain I want to get caught in the rain I want some Dr pepper but I don’t want to go buy some because I don't want to spend the money I want to get an exhaust even though I haven't even found anybody to race up here I should write to PROPNAME I need to check the mail who cares about the kennedys I hope I have some mail but I really doubt it I never get mail my room looks so boring I don't like living in a dorm it really sucks but I guess this is better than jester it's kind of hard to think and write at the same time I hate typing why are her clothes still hanging there what's wrong with using the dryer I need to do laundry double your pleasure double your fun my boobs itch I guess I shouldn't have tanned for so long     
__label__label0 I have done these things before and I really don't think that they work. I had to do one in English one time and I hated it. I guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now I will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. I love scream, its on the tv right now and I like this movie. ;  I here that the second one is do out this winter so I’m excited. I really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. The brain is so complex. I used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew I was thinking about itself. Hmmm, I don't know what to say  exactly. I am gonna play some pool after I get done writing this paper. I have a pool table at home so I am probably better than average but lately I've been playing worse and worse. It really frustrates me too. I hate when I don't play basketball for a while because then I go back and I'm just A LITTLE OUT OF RYTHEM OR I MISS A SIMPLE SHOT OR SOMETHING. Recently I have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and I feel bad about that because I always pre0ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. I'm being A BIT Distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. I don't know I f  I can really   fill up another ten minutes but I guess I can because I have to. It really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because I've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so I don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines I don't know if I agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because I know I don't think of sex that much. Imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny A hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. I often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. I wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . I coughed. ehehehehe  I think I have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. I wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get I would love to be able to read some of them . I think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. I don't know what I’ve been told . I like led zep but not all of their stuff. It is pretty good though . I wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . I hope so Oh my time is up so I'm gonna go know. Bye bye baby!!!! 
__label__label1 I am at work right now but I don’t start to work until about 00 more minutes I wonder if any one is  going to if anyone is going to ask me what I am doing oh well there is this person that I think is real nice so I cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so I guess ill start to press enter when I cant see the words I am typing  I feel like laughing I don’t really know why well I do but it would be  to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see I wish I could go  home I just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. I still like the class though  cant wait fort he day to be over. I is supposed to rain today I want it to but I don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard I cant type as quick as my mind thinks I'm not sure I like this computer either well I’m still skipping my thoughts  on the next assignment I think I better write it down instead. ok the truth  I did erase something from the beginning of this document. I’m at work for goodness sakes. why do I keep putting periods down I guess it is hard to  write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok I've got to stop that oh well I didn’t know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what I was doing I wish I had more time to write some more poems I will though I really want to perfect the one I wrote about the tanut this I going to look crazy when they print it out. I like this assignment though I never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn’t have enough speed to get everything on the net on  my computer I rally want to  buy some more software for it but I don’t know if I can afford it so this guy that I was telling you about is so fine I feel like I want to jump his bones I even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn’t even sexual so I wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings I hope my TA gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy I have a boy friend thought it will be five years in November I don’t believe it I love him though ok my mind has gone blank I cant think of anything I wish that when I write paper that the information I need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so I could write a complete 00 page paper in one day I guess I would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday I should have been writing my thoughts down I actually because aware became aware of what I was thinking it was kind of weird why to I keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow I bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment I wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if I did know. naked why I don’t know so one to the next topic my the way I wasn’t taking bout the Winston cigarette ads you know I don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until I have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that I do I won't be doing it for the rest of my life though I do know that for sure actually I’m not sure I know what I want to do bye. 't be doing it for                            
__label__label1 My stream of consciousness is being disrupted by several things at this time. My computer has been giving me nothing but continual stress and troubles. First, my computer is a piece of crap. I called a guy to come hook everything up to it and he basically laughed and was unable to figure it out. Then the guy told me to take it to the campus computer store. I carried the entire, heavy hard drive to the store in the heat. While there, everyone I talked to laughed at me. I ate dinner alone, as I usually do since I have not made very many new friends. I have had no sleep because of how many classes I've had to take this semester because of credit hours and retouching courses. I am so stressed out. I just learned that my CDROM drive isn't working so I'm about to cry because now when I go home this weekend I have to convince my parents to fork over a bunch of money they don't have so my computer will be like everyone else’s'. My roommate’s Dad went through and installed everything one can possibly think of so she laughs at my computer problems which makes me feel worse. I miss my home and my dogs and my boyfriend and my friends so much that now I'm crying. All the stress I'm feeling is making me depressed and hungry and tired all the time. PROPNAME, my roommate keeps me up really late at night and then wakes up at 0:00 to put on ALOT of makeup. She is so loud that I want to scream, but instead I keep my mouth shut because it feels like when I open my mouth to say things that might hurt peoples feelings or make them mad I end up losing the close relationship I had with them. So I guess I'm sort of keeping everything inside so that I don't lose any few friends that I made. It seems like everyone makes better grades than me here. I am so scared because I have so many questions about ORGNAME but nobody seems to know how to answer them. I knew that moving up here would be a big change, but I thought I could handle it. I know that once I adjust I will grow very strong and independent from this experience, but I feel that I may not be ready. I don't wear makeup for some reason that I have never been able to figure out. I always feel like I need improvement in something. Like with this essay, even though I know the length of it does not matter, I still feel it must be long to be acceptable. When I walk around to my classes I see so many people that they all look the same to me. It is so hot outside when I walk. I'm so thirsty right now that I am going to send this paper so I can get a drink. Then I'm going to call my mother and beg for a computer like everyone else has so I can feel like I fit in more. I won't get it so now I've got to prepare to use PROPNAME's computer all year. My boyfriend is driving up here on Friday to spend the day with me at UT. I wish I had my own apartment so I could get some sleep. 
__label__label0 College seems very stressful. It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 00000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs LOCNAME. The attitude of "wanting to learn " is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess PROPNAME tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is "Greatness courts failure"  I don’t think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw PROPNAME in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the PROPNAME PROPNAME '00 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in LOCNAME when PROPNAME was released (Didn’t happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was PROPNAME PROPNAME, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though 
__label__label1 I am very excited to be taking this psychology class since I was unable to take a psych. class in highschool. I am hoping that this class will give me some  direction on my major. As of this moment I am supposed to be working towards pharmacy school, but I am beginning to think that it wouldn't keep my interest for very long.    (You know it is very hard for me to just write in my train of thought, and I don't know why. I'm not much of a perfectionist or anything)    Anyway back to psychology, Psychology really sparks my interest. In class, we discuss finding answers to many questions, but they normally pertain to other people than ourselves. Most of the questions that I would like to explore pertain to understanding myself. I am generally a happy person, and although I know that I will go through tremendous changes during my college career, I feel that I have a pretty good grip on the person I am. But--even though I feel this way, sometimes I have uncontrollable and unexplainable emotions. When this happens, all I can think is "why?"  Psychology is one of those things that I  don't know much about, but even with the little knowledge I have, I am amazed. I think it is very possible I may want to have a career in this area. I don't  really know how I got on this spill about your class; probably because it drives me crazy not knowing what I want to do. I've always had everything very planned out, but after really thinking about it, that isn't the way I want to plan the rest of my life (if that makes any sense). What I mean is. I can't just pick a job (say Pharmacist), and decide "I’m gonna be a pharmacist. "  That is what I  did about a year and a half ago. I even got a job as a pharmacy tech at ORGNAME’s which could help me out a lot. But, now I feel like pharmacy would get very dull  and boring. I feel like I'm on an endless search for something that really sparks my interest. I've never been really exceptional at one thing or in one subject, and that makes me feel kind of lost, like I don't have a calling. Psychology sparks my interest more than anything else, but I haven't been through the  course so I can't really say if I have a "passion" for it or anything.   Along with my search for a "passion," I want success more than anything. I have had an average life I guess, but my life would never be complete with out stress. Not stress in general, but financial stress. I know that I am much more fortunate than many others, so why am I so stressed. I guess because all of  my best friends were spoiled rotten, and I began to forget that I was so fortunate. I wasn't able to do all the things they were able to, I didn't get to drive a  nice car, go shopping , or out to ear. These are all things that I believe are superficial, but I would like to be able to do these things with no worries  when I am older. Even more so, I would like to spoil my kids rotten when that time comes around. Anyway (I’m a little scatterbrained today), I am a little afraid that when I find my so called passion that it will be something that will not allow me to accomplish my second goal. 
__label__label0 I feel weird I know I’m about to pull an all nighter and I have this eternal sense of flux but I’m not in anguish at all I’m actually euphoric some how like I said I’m feeling weird that's why I’m doing thins now I don't know really what I’m supposed to say but I guess it doesn’t matter well I’m kind of at a stand still I hope you can read all of my word I’m a totally phonetic speller you see I’m dyslexic how ever you spell it well I’ll just start talking then things are always weird well nothing is normal it's not suppose to be that would be incredible boring and stagnate but  it's just we never know were we are and never know exactly what we want and even if were some were we never know is this really were I want to be  is this what I want to do I guess it don’t matter much were always were  we are and were always how we are entail we change which is normally but different than how I usually am because its different but I’m not indecisive  I think I just question it all and I’m yet to come up with the answer  tired but awake I actually like this and I cant what to participate in the  experiments ( I’m lazy and all I do is procrastinate that’s why this  allnighter thing is happening) tired but wanting to do my work I actually get cote up in it when I actually do it I like working but I procrastinate  there's all ways people to talk to and women to hit on and don't get me wrong I just need people my friend and especially the female ones I just need close  people that all is there to be with and together nothing more the one  but any way I get mad at my self for not doing what I need to in school because  I actually like it all I love learning but I just cant put my ass in the  chair and sit once I do I get it done and have fun doing it I still feel weird just lackadaisical and it's one of the few times I feel like reading and  studying even though I do like it when I do it I feel like I’m giving you the  wrong info. just not what your looking for well sorry but it happens  I think I want to do work because my body wants me to sleep and I’m just procrastinating from that like usual its also why I’m taking so long to  do this its not reading its just like me sitting out side talking but I guess its enough and I hope it works for what you want  so  I’ll put me always  phrase in here and say good bye   have fun          
__label__label0 I’m in the mood to write and so I decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes I get in this mood to write anything and everything that’s on my mind. I guess it only happens when I’m bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so I don’t know. how should I describe. I guess I was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being?  why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. you’d think id get the hang of it by now. but I don’t want to become like them. whoever’s reading this. are you PROPNAMEian?  I am. or I believe in God and His Son PROPNAME Christ and I try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet I know I’m doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. I think I've got the harmless as doves thing down, but I’m not very wise. I always get so hurt. I don’t know what to say. my thoughts don’t seem to be flowing and I cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. I wish everyone were. how come I cant think. but I’m supposed to write for 00 minutes so I guess ill continue. no, I’m not totally disappointed with all people or anything if that’s what it sounds like. in fact I love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. I gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet I always for her. she never once cleaned yet I never complained. I bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. I cared for her well being. I never said anything to hurt her. I don’t even know how to describe. I really did care about her well being. as roommates, I thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and I tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. I gave up my bed and moved into the living room  since we had a one bedroom. living with anyone’s mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. I still cleaned. but she did cook. although I didn’t eat at home that much. I tried to go home late and leave early because it wasn’t very comfortable with someone else’s mom at home. I tried my best. and I really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out I noticed I was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, I presumed she must have misplaced. so I left a note before I left for school to check for me - that I’m not sure how many silverware because I lost some in moving before and so its not too many I’m sure, but a few. when I came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, "look! this is ours,"  then another wrapped piece,  saying "look,"  and more and more. I was so shocked. I told her I didn’t mean to accuse her of stealing, if that’s what she had mistaken it, but  she said no, that’s not it  well its been over 00 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and I wasn’t going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. I have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 0nd was only for the summer)and I hope everything goes well. I wrote about this because I saw my 0nd roommate today. and though we never fought I don’t think were friends anymore. and every time I think of her,  I’m hurt. 
__label__label1 Okay here I am after I've been spending tons of time trying to get a book I need. I'm not worried about it anymore. I will focus on my other homework. I need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. Maybe I won't eat lunch. Tonight I have a party to go to and I am excited. I need to tell my friend what time we will leave. Where will I park? Maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. The radio is on and I'm listening to country music. It's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. I am going home tomorrow. I can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. I will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. Sleep is a priority as well. Oh, and I'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. Wow, I forgot about the chance that I will get a home cooked meal. I need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. I'll come home Monday evening. I need to wash my car while I'm there. I hope my roommate is occupied enough while I'm gone. She can come home with me another time. I hear people in the hall all the time. It's amazing how many are up as early as I for an 0 am class. No one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. My eyes burn because I'm so tired. I took an hour nap yesterday, but I don't have time today. I can't get my Ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--I'm VERY frustrated. very chapped! I am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things I  need to do. I know though that I can get it done, just one thing at a time. Plus, I am doing one of those things right now. I wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. I'm an hour away, not bad. I hear this song "looking for love in all the wrong places" and it reminds me of PROPNAME PROPNAME on the old Saturday Night Live. He did Buckwheat impersonations. I have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. I hope this doesn't sound like a letter. I am beginning every sentence with "I" but that's okay because I am supposed to notice how "my" thoughts flow. I wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. Hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. I just wish I could get my Ethernet hooked up. I like ORGNAME ORGNAME, but it's tying up my phone line. That is also making my anxious right now. I guess the faster you type the longer the paper. I wonder what the other students doing this have to say. I wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. I hope I get some mail soon. I check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. I know people are writing/sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. That's my optimistic side. I hate the cold floor under my desk. I'm in jester, but I have carpet that I brought to go between the beds. I'm thinking of my friend in LOCNAME that will come at Christmas time. Will we have time for me to show the good stuff about LOCNAME? My throat tightens to think of it. I stress easily. I feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that LOCNAME is the coolest place to be. It won't be as pretty in December though. Great, I have about 0 more minutes. My hands are slipping off this  tiny space. I have no room on my desk. I want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. It would be so ideal. I am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. I feel like I'll lose the urge to do my math homework if I sit here any longer. Oh, I can't wait until the party. ORGNAME 00 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! I need to remember to take my camera. I also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. All of this by 0 PM--I believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. Well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. I wish I could go to sleep. I hate it when I can't focus because I'm so tired. I value sleep more than money it seems. If that makes any sense. I am ready to go now, I feel the pressure of having too many things to do. I will take care of my math homework first. Then biology and art history. Psychology is halfway done now, but I need to get the book. no one has it. That is also causing a little aggravation. I hate to not be fully prepared for everything. Okay, my 00 minutes are up, I feel better having done this. 
__label__label0 Labor day weekend was awesome! I love my boyfriend so much. We were so lazy and it didn't even matter what I did with him, because just being with him was enough. We just watched movies and ate. He sent me flowers on Bid day for the sorority Pi Beta Phi. I love that he knows everything about me. He knows when I am sad, happy, etc. I really miss him right know. I hope that he can come on Sunday so that he can se my dorm room and meet my pledge sisters. I can't wait to see what he does for my birthday. I can't believe that I am going to be nineteen years old. It doesn't feel like I should be that old. It just seems like yesterday that I turned sixteen and got my driver's license. My sister is twenty-two years old and engaged. I'm so excited about being her maid of honor in the wedding. I know that I am going to be so emotional that day. Troy is so perfect for her. I know that they will have a long and happy marriage together. He is just like a brother to me. My parents are glad that they will only be an hour away from them. It seems weird that we don't live in LOCNAME anymore. I consider LOCNAME as my home, and not LOCNAME. My parents evidently seem to like it there, even though it is so humid. I thought that LOCNAME was humid. It is nothing compared to LOCNAME. I love PROPNAME so much!  It will be neat when his dad is in session. Maybe he will take me out to eat so I don't have to eat the dorm food all of the time. It really isn't that bad! I just hope that I don't gain the "Freshman 00. "  Dancing will keep me in shape, though. I love my class. Ballet three times a week is just enough times to keep me from not missing my dance studio in Waco. It is really neat to get a lot of different styles of dance from different teachers. I think that it helps and has helped me to be a more well-rounded dancer, and open to new things. I miss my friends from high school. I just talked to PROPNAME today. I was so excited that she called. I know that I am going to have to start writing letters and e-mailing my friends and PROPNAME, after my one hundred dollar phone bill in ten days. I feel really bad about that, but I just didn't understand the whole "phone bill thing. "  As they say, everyone learns from their mistakes. I definitely had to learn the hard way, though. I hope that I have a cheaper bill next month, for my parents' sake. 
__label__label0 Right now I am tired and I am thinking about going to bed. I imagine what my classes will be like in thew morning and that I have to get up at 0:00 to be  ready on time for my Astronomy class. I think if I have any home work or stuff  that I have to have done for class. I then think of my next class which is Psychology. I think if I have any preparation I need to do for that class. I then think about what I'm gonna eat for breakfast and then for lunch. I then think that I need to go to the Microcenter  to get the software I need for my business classes. I am disrupted by one of my friends who call me on ORGNAME. I talk to him for a few minutes and then get back to writing. I then immediately receive a phone call  and I talk on the phone for about 0 min. Then I begin to worry how long I've been typing for and I try to remember when I started. I feel that it is time to go to bed so I decide to submit  the assignment. 
__label__label1 Trying to track my thoughts. That's weird because I don't even know were to start. At the moment I am wondering who just called because I thought one of my roommates would of answered it but they didn't and who every it was hung up. I am also worried about my food that is cooking in the oven. It is suppose to be done in thirty minutes and I sure am hungry. I kind of mad at the moment because the ORGNAME just lost to the ORGNAME and they shouldn't have. To tell you the truth its kind of hard to sit here and just type what I am thinking  because I not thinking of anything. One of my roommates is talking on the phone and being really loud but she does have a big mouth. She is talking to my other roommate and asking him if he wants to meet the person on the phone for lunch tomorrow but they never ask me but I don't mind because the guy they are meeting gets on my nerves. That was weird. An icon came up on my screen and said my connection has been idle for twenty minutes and will disconnect if I don't  click on the stay connected. I guess that means I have been typing for twenty minutes or maybe not. It is weird the way I have been typing for so long and I am just on the second line. I know I have typed more than that I hope. My back is starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly in this chair and typing  but I guess I have typed for twenty minutes so I can stop now. I probably didn't type that much but I am not a good typer and I make a lot of mistakes. I guess I'll stop now. 
__label__label1 Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 0 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in LOCNAME really do try to chat with other people in LOCNAME alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 0 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him LOCNAME In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in LOCNAME LOCNAME. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 00 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see PROPNAME in 0 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at ORGNAME so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish PROPNAME lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at LOCNAME this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for ORGNAME right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to LOCNAME. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call PROPNAME. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. 
__label__label1 I’m so uptight about writing this. There is so much on my mind that I do not even know where to start. PROPNAME is trying so hard to get PROPNAME to live with her and it works out great if he does, but I just do not know how it will work. if my sister starts to bother him then he will tell me about it, and by the same token if he bothers her I will be the first to hear it. I do not understand why I am so lazy lately. it took me an hour to just decide to get down here to do this and all of my other classes are the same way. I am so nervous about trying out for spirits and dance team on Wednesday I just do not know if I can do it, it all sounds like fun, but what if ORGNAME and PROPNAME get in and I don't? I am the one who told PROPNAME about it in the first place and I don’t think that it would be fair. I need to get my room clean before mom and dad get home , do some homework, take a nap, read a few chapters for psychology, I’m so glad that I got PROPNAME’s drivers license mailed to he she’s probably going to be pissed off because it took so long but I have just been so busy. I wonder how she’s doing since PROPNAME’s not around/ maybe ill call her later after I have done everything else. . I totally forgot to tell PROPNAME that I got a 00 out of 0 on my very first math quiz. mom should be happy, she'll probably just say it was easy anyway but I’m happy about it and I know PROPNAME will be too. some time soon I need to go to the mec to find out if my Spanish credit is in yet. I cant believe I never would have guessed in a million years that I would be a sophomore in college by the end of my first semester. PROPNAME and I are going to be late to dinner at cricky's tonight if he has to mow so many people's yards, but why am I worried about it they talked an agreed on a certain time then its none of my business. I hope he wont get rid of PROPNAME, I love that cat and if I did not live at home I would take her. maybe PROPNAME and I will get married at the end of this year after all then we wont have to worry about stupid little things like this and rent will be alot easier to pay if there are two of us contributing to the cause. I wonder what our babies are going to be like. I think that all of the boys will be just like him, moody. what will it be like to engaged as sophomores in college, that is if we aren't engaged in a month that would be wonderful I know it would motivate me to work alot harder. 
__label__label0 I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that PROPNAME is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in LOCNAME, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. 
__label__label1 I returned to LOCNAME Monday night at about 00:00 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was PROPNAME and the source of her angst was my best friend PROPNAME. They, as I am, are both from LOCNAME. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for ORGNAME. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. PROPNAME declares she is "so totally over PROPNAME" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to PROPNAME, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in LOCNAME. She has a lot of frustration with PROPNAME, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. PROPNAME's feelings toward PROPNAME are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions PROPNAME is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be "friends", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto PROPNAME as a friend. PROPNAME's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 00 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both PROPNAME and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to Huge UT ORGNAME life challenging. Thank you. 
__label__label0 I don't know what I should be doing right now. I mean life is so complicated and strange to me. My father says I can do whatever I want to at university and he will be happy with it, but the thing is if I do what I want then he would be pretty upset with me. Hell, he would disown me. I don't know why I have to do things in order to please him but I have to. Its like I have no choice. I am just starting to get his trust back and I don't want to lose that little bit that I have. You could say that I'm destined to do what other people want me to do. That is the way that society is these days. We are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow; and if we don't conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society. The "norm" they call it. Why does there have to be a "norm". I don't see why we can't live the way that we choose and be free. Oh well, back to happy thoughts. Amanda. There is a happy thought. I wonder. I wonder what?  I don't know. I guess I wonder if it will work. I'm nuts about he she is nuts about me, but we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. I guess that is true about a lot of couples. But I still don't know. What I do know is that I want to stay together, even though everyone is talking about us. I don't care how old she is. Hell, she is only 0 years younger that me so that doesn't matter. People are just making a big deal out of it because I am in college and she is a sophomore in high school. She is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me. She understands a lot of things. I guess that is because she grew up in Saudi. People there are generally more mature than people here in the states. We are forced to grow up faster than people here. We lose our innocence faster, and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker. Lets leave it on this note. These are strange days that will challenge our true selves. I wish I could go deeper than that but I'm not going to spill all of my guts to a computer. Later babe. 
__label__label0 Well I was a little worried about using the Internet because I have never used before. I have used e-mail last year a little but for the most part this is a whole new experience to me. Today has been a good day I really enjoy my Monday and Wednesday class schedule. Except for the fact that I do have to get up at 0:00, but that is actually a good thing because my day is done at 00:00am and I have the rest of the day to do primarily whatever I want. I'm a little worried about the amount of stress that college has been. It is entirely not that bad because I do tend to be a organized person and good with managing my time. Although I do have to admit the reason why it has probably been so hard to get back on track this year is because my Senior year in high-school I got that little thing called "senioritis". I was hoping to be able to do this assignment from my computer in my dorm room, but the communications company has had a hard time getting my Ethernet Link set up. This is kind of nice though coming to the Undergraduate Library and getting acquainted with their systems. I have not decided what I am going to do this weekend, because it is one of my really good high-school friends birthday and she is going to school at ORGNAME ORGNAME. So therefore a lot of my friends are going to go down to College Station and surprise her. I really want to go but I want to stay here and go to the football game that is if I get a date. Which as of now I don't have one, but I am in a sorority here on campus and we have a mixer tonight with a fraternity so maybe I will get lucky and someone will ask me. Anyhow though these little events such as a mixer kind of make me uncomfortable because my boyfriend goes to school at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and it's strange trying to interact with other guys. Well I think I completely said that wrong it is not hard at all to interact with the opposite sex, but we decided mutually that we needed to try and date other people and not stay completely focused on someone who is 0 hours away. Anyhow this is really strange this assignment because I keep getting this urge to go back and re-word what I have just said. I do realize the point of the assignment and that is not what matters. I am really hoping that I have a great first semester at college. I am already enjoying it tremendously but I am a little nervous about the academics. My father will not allow me to bring my car up here until "my grades have proven worthy" as he says. I thought that was going to be a big deal but everywhere you go is within walking distance so it truly doesn't matter. Well I just glanced at my watch and it has been 00 minutes so I will be going back to my room now. 
__label__label1 Right now I don't know what to write. PROPNAME sure is cute, and funny too, it was nice of him to email me I wish PROPNAME and I hadn't gotten in a fight earlier today. he overreacted  I am glad dad emailed me. I miss my parents  I am sick of this school the work is hard  my astronomy makes no sense  I am going to fail  PROPNAME is giving us too much work  I need to read for eng and psy  I don't know what to expect  from the tests here. I can't wait to go home  dinner with PROPNAME was fun  it sucks that laurissa and I don't hang out anymore. neither do PROPNAME and I  no one ever writes me  I wish that I went to U of H and lived at home  I am not motivated  I don't like my edp teacher. she makes no sense in our assignments  PROPNAME is so inconsiderate about the TV  I hope linds likes her present. . it wasn't exactly cheap. too bad we aren't closer. I wish that we were  I wish that she would get better and get on track. . . I wish I would get on track. . . I am so disorganized! Psy is going to be hard. I can't remember anything!  I never did study. study skills class is a joke b/c I know it won't help. boy, my typing sure does suck  I miss my work!  I need to email or write PROPNAME. she was a sweet boss. PROPNAME hoggs the TV and is inconsiderate but lupe is nice. julie is too nice for her own good, and she talks about "daddy's money" too much. people like that are annoying I hate it here b/c its just too much to handle I can't wait to go home this weekend!  that will be an adventure with all of the family roller coasters! I can't believe aunt rita did it before she got married!  actually, I can, but still its weird. linds needs to get over paul I hope we go see a movie on Friday. I hope she wears the necklace I got her. I miss PROPNAME. . . I wish he were a little more considerate of my feelings. . PROPNAME is SoOOO presumptuous!  to change the channel while I am watching it??? I hope that no one thinks I am  nuts when they read this. I am getting upset b/c of how inconsiderate everyone is!!!  I am so glad mom called and dad emailed me! I miss them. I can't wait to go home. I hope the 00 mins goes by fast!!!  this is getting boring. I need to read for English marc is so funny. . . the way he jumps around subjects is so cute!  PROPNAME thinks he is the only one with stress in his life. I am so glad I got the stupid "brain picking" out of the way. PROPNAME worries too much. right now I am annoyed with everyone and everything!  I am going to miss Thursday night shows b/c of stupid astronomy. I want to marry someone rich and stop having to study. I hate to study this sucks. . all the work!  my time is up sooN!!!  okay, maybe not. I wonder if they would know I did it for half the time, probably so. everything I am writing is stupid. I am tired and hate astronomy  its too broad a subject. I can't visualize the universe so I  can't understand any of the topics. I am a visual person. I have to see to understand!  PROPNAME took PROPNAME, so did the girl next to me. I wish that PROPNAME and PROPNAME would stop being so "happy" and Sappy with each other. its sick and I think it is unhealthy that he cries about her all the time. he’s a big baby and I think it would never work with them b/c its soooo sappy and I think its unhealthy that they plan their lives around each other when they have only been dating for 0 months. PROPNAME and I don't do that and we have been going out for 0 years. maybe we should break up. . yeah right, that'll never happen b/c we're too comfortable, bad!  Oh well, that’s life and what can I do? PROPNAME totally monopolizes the room. PROPNAME is so funny. I can’t WAIT TO go home!  I miss my parents, they have such a hand full with PROPNAME!  Why can't she be more normal and get "it" together. I am tired of everyone blaming me for her troubles, its not my fault, I am bossy but that didn't make her the way she is. Yes!!!  only 0 mins to go!  Thank GOD. I really should go to church here, I sure have strayed into the last 0 months, we never missed before we moved. PROPNAME lives too far from the new house, glad he got a car. can't wait for Saturday’s Date!!!  Hope he takes me to carrabbas,  I am sooo hungry. wish the store was still open, I want pizza. vic is selfish. I wish she would go to lupe's tonight. I prefer to have the room to myself. I don't like her too much, thought she is okay some times, but still, UNCONSIDERATE!!!  just b/c she’s a soph, doesn't mean she’s superior to me in any way!!!  She needs to just  get over herself and go to lupes for the night. . . I liked it better when she spent the night out. I am hungry. stress makes me hungry, I am mad and upset with vic, and PROPNAME too, I hope he called, so I can call him back!  YES. . . one more min. this was harder that I thought b/c I am soooo tired. couldn't check my messages b/c PROPNAME was on the phone!!!  AHHHHHH  I don't like her!!!!!  she needs to be more considerate like me. I bend over backwards to be considerate for her!!!  ahhhhhhhhhh  THE END. THANK GOD!!! 
__label__label1 this week is the most religious week in my religion. I haven’t been fasting like I should be. it's gets kind of difficult being in school and all . but maybe I should try harder. I mean, aren't I supposed to be responsible enough to handle things on my own. my parents sent me off to college hoping I can learn to be more responsible and independent. maybe I’ll try to fast tomorrow. actually, I have been kind of bad lately. I have been eating things I should not be. and I have also been eating after dark. I wonder . how much am I going to pay for this later?  I mean in terms of sins and punishments. I am, basically, a decent human being. many other people think so. but then again, it matters what I think and if I think I am a descent person. well am I. or not?    I am . but I could be a lot better. -guess everybody can. but oh well . why do I stress about little things so much?  maybe I get it from dad. he always gets uptight over little things. man, come to think of it, I act like dad a lot. I mean I get aggravated at little things, I have, more or less, the same morals and practices. I gotta stop stressing so much or I am not gonna be able to handle college too well. it seems like I try to seem calm and collected in presence of other people, but in reality I’m stressed. I seem to have a lack of self confidence. but at times, I feel more confident about myself than ever. is that uncommon?  I dunno. my lack of self confidence really does bother me. and it affects the way I am perceived by my peers. some people, like my friend *******, I mean you can just tell by the way he talks and carries himself, that is extremely confident and secure about himself. I want to be like that but I also need to be who I am, you know?  I go through phases of feeling high and low self esteem. I think my brother has a lot of effect on me. it seems like I’m always feeling less confident about myself when I am around him. he has a great way of bringing out the worst in me and making me feel like crap. he does well too. butt he only does it to his family. isn’t that weird?  to everybody else he is a terrific guy. but little do they know that he treats his loved ones the worst. or so it feels like it. but I never have the guts to stand up to him. why don't I. it's because I’m not confident of who am and what I stand for and what I want to be. and <----- that really, I mean really bothers me. and until I figure all that out, ill continue to feel just I am feeling now, maybe worse. my brother is always in the back of my mind. if I buy a shirt, will he get mad that it costs too much, or I already had one like it, or I don’t need another one. I hate him being on my shoulder in every thing I do. how can I get him out of my head. some time I wish he wasn’t so smart and intelligent. then maybe he'd respect me for my own person, not the way he is or the way he wants me to be, maybe like an equal, maybe like a brother, and not a puppet. man I got some problems with myself. but I guess everyone does, right?  what make mine so much more important than others?  at least I have my health, great family, money, an education, shelter, food. where am I inside myself. I must know. I’m dying to find out so I can get on with my life - with some meaning and reason. I feel chaos . 
__label__label0 I have to work at 0pm, go back to my dorm, and get everything organized I still have to do my geology homework and study that since science is hard for me. I need to go shopping for food also and get my internet connection set up. I hope my dad can help me because if not I don’t know when I will ever get on the net and all my assignments are due over it. I also need to call my PROPNAME in College Station. I don’t know what to do in that situation. I think I love him but I need to date others--but who to date? I am not interested in anyone I only want to know for sure if it is PROPNAME I want but how do I know if he really wants me when we go to such different schools and he will probably find an aggie woman I could find a longhorn man also . the guy I just met is pretty cool but I don't see me dating him maybe I should just have fun and see what happens no need to get serious yet-- unlike PROPNAME and I do not want to be like her and PROPNAME. I am glad I didn’t have to quit my job I love everyone there only my manager is driving me crazy with the shifts I am getting hopefully it will all work out but I have to work 0 shifts today and I still have so much to do I just need to relax or something but I cant until I get all my stuff done. oh well I wish I had time to tell my mom and dad everything that is going on here but things keep coming up people are always calling and or dropping by and there is no time to call unless it is at midnight when they have been asleep for hours its funny because you would think that since we live in the same city I would be able to talk easily but I cant tomorrow is labor day I wonder if PROPNAME will want to do any thing he probably will and I don't know if I have time or not to spend the day with him and if I don’t he will probably throw a fit since he lives in san marcos but he can come home all the time if he wants or I can visit him I wish he wasn’t so needy he has to really we are not together but he has always been like this that is why we could never work out not like brad though he is wonderful but he wrote me some letter I haven’t gotten it yet and he says parts of it are sad and parts happy I wonder is it good sad like he misses me or bad sad like he met someone else I will find out in the next few days  I wonder if PROPNAME got my letter and how he is doing I wonder how mecredy is doing and when he is going back to LOCNAME the PROPNAME strait concert was great I wonder is they got to see brad I wonder how PROPNAME is I haven’t talked to her in a couple of days and we have to do the draw together on Tuesday I hope she can stand in line with me and I may have to leave early since I work at 00:00 I don’t know the games are going to be great I hope I get to go to the A&m game! I don’t think I want to hang out with brad that weekend though I don’t know it depends on him and who knows if I'll get tickets I really want to go though Tyler already has some lined up I wonder how you get to college Station I'm sure someone will give me directions I hope it isn’t too scary I don’t know what I would wear I wonder whose car we could take mine would never make it and it has UT stickers all over so they would trash it

__label__label0 However, I feel I could be falling into a trap that could severely effect my grades. My roommate is a friend from high school and unfortunately for me he likes to stay out very late. I have early classes and it is starting to take a toll on me. It doesn't seem as if there is enough time in a day. I am looking forward to playing club volleyball here and I really enjoy the coach. Volleyball is by far my favorite sport. I need to start asking some girls I have met out on dates. I am enrolled in a dancing class with one of my girlfriends and I am having a lot of fun with it. My parents are coming up to see me tomorrow and will be bringing my bicycle with them. It is funny, I love my parents very much but I really don't miss them. I don't have a desire to go home any time soon. My suitemates are having friends stay the night and I hope that they will not be too noisy. After the football game tonight I think I will do some homework and go to bed. I am looking forward to this psychology class. I find it very interesting so far. I need to be sure to keep up in my reading. 
__label__label1 I am from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I feel sick all of the time. I don't feel nervous or anxious, I just don't feel well. I started feeling this way when I moved to LOCNAME. I usually don't get more than 0 hours of sleep a night and I usually only eat one meal per day. I don't think that I am depressed, although last night I cried for about 00 minutes because I was thinking about things from the past. I miss my ex-boyfriend. When we broke up I felt like a failure because he was the only guy that I tried for. He has been the only guy that I have ever cared about. I also cried because I miss my mother. She died from leukemia when I was 0. Right now I don't feel like studying for my Chemistry quiz tomorrow, even though I really need to. There is this problem I seem to have with caring. I just don't. There are only two people in this whole world that I would cry at their funerals if they were to die. Those two people are my dad and my brother. Lately I feel like they don't really care to talk to me though. My best friend is also my roommate and she has gotten a call or a visit from someone in her family at least everyday. I haven't gotten a call from anyone in my family yet. I guess it doesn't really matter though. There is this guy in Austin that I may start to actually like. I met him at the summer orientation for pre-freshmen. Then, over the summer, he spent five days looking up my phone number over the internet. (Or so he says)  Well now we are sort of dating and I'm starting to get a little interested. I'm very insecure though, and I think that he is too good-looking for me and soon he will find someone better. That's why I try not to let myself care too much for him. My roommate thinks that I am just a player because I talk to a lot of guys, but that is not what I want. I want someone to want to be with me all of the time, and no one else. I only want one person for me, but at the same time there are so many new and interesting people attending this University that I have a hard time being serious about committment right now. I don't know. I guess I will just have to see what happens, right?  My dad doesn't understand that I don't care about my new step-mother. She is my second step-mother because my dad and first step-mother got a divorce. I didn't care about her either. My first step-mother had two sons of her own and I was glad when they got divorced because I didn't like her or her sons. My step-mother now, I like, but I just don't care what happens. She is not my mom. You only have one mother in a lifetime. As long as she makes my father happy, she is cool. I'm so tired, but I probably won't be able to sleep again tonight. Most of my classes are giving me a lot of work to do. My friends all say that it sucks to be PROPNAME, but I don't really care. I have a job interview on Friday. I don't want a job, but my dad wants me to get one. I want to go home. Home is not my dorm room, and it's not my house in LOCNAME LOCNAME where my parents live either. I say that I want to go home all of the time, but I still don't know what I mean when I say it. When I find that place where I am happy I guess then I will know what I mean. I'm not a happy person. yet. I am content, but not happy with my life. I have this one candle that I light when I feel truly happy. I haven't lite it in years. 
__label__label1 I keep coughing so much in class I think I probably annoy the crap out o everybody there. I should stop smoking so much. It feels good to be back in school, seeing friends again, but I miss my mom. She is wittiog all the way in LOCNAME and I'm over here. IT sucks. But there is always Christmas time, so it is not that bad. I have no idea what that holiday is going to be like. This guy just bumped in to me an did not even apologize. I hate it when people do that. He just walks by like It's okay to knock people into a damn computer screen. Jerk. I don't understand how I am going to keep writing for twenty minutes. The way I type it will probably be the worst thing anyone has ever read. I tend to type fast and then screw up a lot along the way. There is a guy near me talking a bout the Swiss air crash and PROPNAME PROPNAME. I hate baseball so I couldn't care less. There goes my cough again. I got to get home soon, I got a date. This is really a nice girl and I hope it works out, but I will probably spend the hold time coughing anyway. The guy is now talking about wire services. What in the world are wire services. I am getting kind of thirsty and I should get a drink of water, but I do not know where the water fountains in this library are. I hate asking people about it, I guess I feel stupid. I wonder what the guys who read this stuff do. Do they analyze it of just laugh at the kind of things people come up with. I would probably laugh a lot. If this was me reading it I would be cracking up. Then a gain I am kind of a jerk. What I don't understated about the internet is how people think its so much phone. I like e mail and research its great. But this whole surfing the web for hours like its some sort of athletic event seems kinds stupid. I thinks I sound like some commercial  I saw. Its amazing how TV effects you like that. You watch some stupid ditcom and then start using the vocab all over the palace. IT hate the people who keep going yadda yadda because of Seinfeld. But then again I pick up enough catch [phrases anyway. I just looked at  the watch, another ten minutes of writing. This is really weird. This is the first psych class I have taken and so far I enjoyed it. This is a different kind of activity. I have difficulty understanding how this helps us learn anything, but then again I am cynical by nature. The prof was talking about the brain today and it was really technical  I thought the class would not be like that. Not that I mind or I did not understand it, it was just a surprise. Somebody once told that psych classes are some of the most fun, I hope he is right. I don't see much of him anymore, he got married and has kids. So his life really changes. He's like my brother, wee used to hang out and drink beer all the time and go to games and stuff like that. Now he only wants to take his baby to the Children's museum and  do family things. I love the kid, but I miss the old him who would drive off to new Orleans on a whim because he wanted a sandwich form a particular cafe. It's funny who people change. I' feel I have changed in college. I would not say I grew up, I just found out things about myself that I would not have ordinarily known like what it's like to be away form all the comforts of home and how I would handle it. Or to be away form LOCNAME and in LOCNAME again. I kind of glorified it but it did not turn out that way. I hope that December comes so, I am looking forward to all my friends and my parent, an my dog . I want to get a dog hear but the apt does not allow it so I guess I am stuck. My place is too small anyway. I have not really seen that  many apt in Austin that allow pets. but I am sure there a lot. Hey that girl is really cute.                                               
__label__label0 He'll never live that down  I'm glad I finally got to this website so I can get these essays over with, I still have to write the other one before Friday--I can't wait till homecoming, PROPNAME is such a sweet girl--I wonder what color her dress will be?  Who else will I know there?  Is it wrong that I'm going back home after just being there this weekend?  I had so much fun with PROPNAME but I'm very upset with PROPNAME. I just have to forget about him and continue reminding myself that he's a jerk and PROPNAME doesn't like him  how could she ever like such a loser   he can't get along with anybody and he brags all the time. If I ever get like that I hope someone tells me and I hope I listen to them. Wow, this is really neat- it's like getting all my feelings out and it's really relieving some stress. Can I swear, I'd better not, I don't want to get in trouble--this is college you don't get in trouble--Tomorrow is my birthday! actually my birthday is in less than an hour--00 years old means I can buy cigarettes, dirty magazines, get into clubs, get into bars--of course, I would never do any of that stuff--only perverts get dirty magazines and I hate smoking--It would be cool to go to a club sometimes but most of the girls you meet there are pretty easy---I like PROPNAME so much--I was going to be really upset if she didn't ask me to homecoming--Even though I'm at college and surrounded by a bunch of really cute girls, I would rather be talking to PROPNAME than any of them. This was the first time we actually spent multiple days in a row with each other. her mom is so old-fashioned--"you saw PROPNAME yesterday so you don't have to see him again for a long time"  Well we went to a football game Saturday, Chili's on Sunday, and bowling on Monday  I bowled so well 000--that's like the highest I've gotten in 0 years--she's just good luck I guess  I'm so lucky to have supportive, caring parents   they have taught me that school comes first so it is not really that hard for me to be away from home and I don't have too much trouble getting myself to do homework. that stupid lab stuff is due tomorrow. no maybe it's due Friday   I wish I didn't have to take ch 000  it looks like it's going to be the class to give me the most homework   I heard it was a weed-out course for Chem E  I don't really feel that much stress right now--I should be really scared about not making it as a chemical engineer because my dad, uncle, and sister are all chem e's but I know I can do it and I know the only way I won't make it is if I don't  study   I can't wait to be 00  I can finally get a credit card-- if I get a credit card will I spend more money?  I doubt it I have check cards and they're the same thing  I've got to stop eating out so often   dad is paying for all my meals at doby and if I'm too lazy to walk over there it's my own fault ---lazy--am I gaining weight?  the freshman 00--would PROPNAME still like me if I were fat?  I don't think I'll get fat--I can always diet  I lost 00 pounds just 0 years ago    boy I hope my parents buy a smaller house so they can get me a car  I wonder if they'd ever get me a camaro  probably not "no 0 door cars you can't get groceries in them"  how often will I be putting groceries in my car anyway?  boy I type pretty fast  I could be a court whatever it's called who types what everyone says--that would be such a scary job  if you ever got behind how would you ever catch back up again?  has it been 00 minute yet  I think so  
__label__label1 I am moving my foot back and forth and I find that to be very reliving for me . I can't believe that the only thing keeping me for getting married is my girlfriend, is that such a big deal am I ready for all that stuff. who is the best person I can talk to that won't ever judge me, I think that it is my girlfriend. I can't believe her,  she is so rude to me when I do something that is not good as far as she is concerned. hard to believe is not it. I don't want to talk about this any more because I am not to worried about it. I have to swim in this thing some day  I use to play football for ORGNAME. I walked on my freshman year and now I don't do anything. I wish I could do something like that now not only reason to stay in shape and but also because I miss it and I want to play again. I type to slow I am very tired of it and I need to go. 
__label__label0 I want to get good grades in all my classes. My goals is to get between a 0. 0 and a 0. 0. which is really going to be hard between fraternity and classes. I really like this college and have seemed to have adjusted well. I like my roommate. He cracks me up. his little insights on lfe entertain me. tomorrow I am going to work out. I need to run. this will keep me healthy and make me feel good about myself. I have to ask a date to My fraternity function for Friday night. the girl I want to ask isn't home but hopefully will be there later. I think that she is cute, and that she might like me. I am worried about classes. I haven't been able to review all my notes. there is just too much to do in this damn town. I heard about my ex-girlfriend today. I hope I never see her again. she amde my senior year so hard. I was so upset over her. I never understood how one person can have such an effect on another person. She might come in for AC, a sammy party. I hope that she doesn't come near me, because if I'm drunk I'll probally tell her to go to hell. I mean, after all she broke my heart. I was the one who felt like shit all the time. I hope she chokes on her own food. But I don't want her to die. Professor said today that love and hate are mixed together. he is so right. I hate stacy so much, but sometimes I just love too much. I wish I could sever all ties with her--oh well shit happens. She just makes me so angry, but my anger is a sign that I haven't gottne rid of my ties to her. this assignment take a long time. I'm really tired because I have been up since 0:00 in the morning. I had to go get football tickets-yea!  I'm going to the 0st game on saturday, that will be a blast. The crowd will probally be nuts. I can't wait. This university is so cool, I just wish that there were no street people on the drag. They just sit around and smoke and ask you for change. These kids need to either go home, I hear that they choose to live that lifestyle, or become a ward of the state. I am almost tapped out. Writing my thoughts is a very hard task. it is mentally challenging. I want to go downstairs to ask out slyvia, but I dn't know if she is home, maybe ill just call alec and see. I have one more minute. My mind is almost blank because I'm so tired. This course is quite hard and I wish you would explain the concepts better. I have to go read my book. Times up. See you in class 
__label__label1 In high school I felt smart. Now I just am a face lost in the crowd. There are so many peole-so unfamiliar. What will I do?  All my friends went to different colleges. The only new people I know are my roomates-and they all have friends from high school to hang with. I feel like an outcast, like an ugly, fat, freshman, high schoolish girl. Even in my pledge class, all the other girls know each other from camp or home or watever. I have made friends though. I feel like my story is a depressing one, but I really am a happy person and I am enjoying college-being away from home. I thought that coming to college I would somehow escape the whole social thing. Obviously there is no escaping society. I was a Debutante, Neches River Festival Grand Lady-in-waiting, Senior Class Vice-President, and so much more. I was shown in the "higher" society. I hated it some, I liked it some. I guess I mainly liked the in control feeling and the attention. I went to public school, not private like most all of the people who came here from LOCNAME, so I really am not friends with mopst of the people I know. The girls I know-from home and in my pledge class-all live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I live in Towers. There again, I feel like an outcast. I feel that somehow these girls look down on me. It seems like all the girls from PROPNAME house are all so close-and I am not allowed to be a part of their "group. "  Sometimes I just want to go home and be with my friends-where I felt I belong. I am excited to be in college, but-now I'm crying-but anyway, I just feel too young. But going home would show a weakness-I can't go home-I can't show that I want to or have an interest. I have always been the strong hard-headed type that doesn't show emotions. I was sick of being at home-I like it here, but it's hard-school that is. I want to do good in school and show my parents and grandparents-that I am a worthy person and I can survive-on my own. I really am happy, but I guess it is just cold feet. It is just going to take some time to adjust and become a sociable person, again. I know I can do it-make my grades and everything-even if it means giving up a party, or two or ten. I will make it and I will succeed. I am forever changing and growing up, but I need to find who I am -as an individual and on my own rather than hide behind the shadow of my comfort zone. 
__label__label1 I just ate and am full. I feel a little stressed trying to write in a flow and finding enough things to write for 00 mins. This is probably one of the strangest things I've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting  I'm so excited to major in it. I'm having a bad morning, because I slept late and now I feel that my whole day is ruined. It's so weird to be doing homework like this, I guess I'm just not used to this. I'm so glad this class is so different. I also love philosophy too. I really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. This is such a pivotal moment in my life, as I embark on college life. Right now I'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. I feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as I click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. I'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and PROPNAME keeps talking on the phone. I get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. Right now I'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and I cannot concentrate. She's always with him, and I can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and I'm sad because were growing apart, and I can't stop it from happening, and I'd really like to. He's so perfect, but I'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because I love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, so I may just lay a passive role in the relationship until I can settle things in my mind. I feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. I have so many confusions and distractions here. My friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. I loved this guy as a friend,  but I've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. I got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing I was upset about was the fact that I have to ruin a Saturday in defensive driving. This assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. I'm really worried that when I finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because I accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done. My very first assignment , and I've probably already messed it up. I guess I'll have to explain the problem to the professor, and hope he understands that I've never used the internet before, and I am an idiot for messing up. well I guess I'll end on this paranoid note, because I really want to do well, and make a 0. 0 this semester. No one believes me, but I have high hopes and determination, and I won't let them bring me down. Well I guess I didn't end on such a bad note after all, but if that's what you need to make it, then I guess I'll end up ok after all 
__label__label0 I'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind. This stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote To the Lighthouse and Mrs. PROPNAME. Her name will come to me in just a second. She was a very depressed person I still can't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die. Oh well, I can't remember her name write now. It is strange that I can't remember her name considering I read over a 0000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work. I think I can't remember because I feel too much stress the remember it. In fact, I feel like right when I stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head. I can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head. Ok I am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what I read earlier today from PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME' Mere Christianity. It is amazing how much I am learning about the Christian faith and I have been a Christian for a while now. I like what PROPNAME says about society and morality. How what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men. No matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion. Well I think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id. I will vehemently oppose such a measure. It is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than I can write. So while I'm in the middle of writing this sentence I have already thought of 0 other things. I am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics. To get to such high positions of power, one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but I wonder if that is really true I wonder if there can be honest politicians I wonder if there can be honest lawyers. I surely hope so  You know I remember reading one that PROPNAME always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day. I wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has I still can't believe she is dead you know I feel like I am kind of censoring what I write because of the possibility that so TA might what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it. I think I probably would if I were a TA  it must be really difficult to be a TA and be a grad student. it is hard enough just being an undergrad student. my head kind of hurts right now I wonder if that is from stress  I think it is. My apartment is quiet right now I am very glad I didn't go out with my roommates I like being by myself every once and a while. I love not having to worry about any body but myself but I also love being around people. I really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together I guess everything has its ups and downs Even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on Tuesday and Thursday instead of on MWF  I'm really now to nervous right now but I am sure I will get stressed out this semester I really need to learn how to deal with my stress. if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit. Ok I only have to write for a couple more minutes. It is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about  it seems like I think about the same basic 00 things over and over when ever I have quite time to myself I wonder why that is I am excited about this psychology class. learning about human behavior is always interesting to me  I think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- I guess sort of a power issue  I hope that now why I am interested in psychology. Well, my time is up now It has been kind of staged my writing but only slightly so I still have in the back of my mind this the knowledge that some one might read what I am writing Oh well 
__label__label1 I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 0 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading "Reader friendly material"  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 00 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in LOCNAME)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 00th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. PROPNAME just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! 
__label__label1 I was wanting to get that pre-testing stuff out of the way, but like most every body else in the fucking class I logged on right after the class, and now the damn test site won't respond. Knowing me, I'm going to forget about it or something. I was just in the mood at the time, and it was on my mind you know? So now I decide to polish off something else (this thing) in hopes that when I'm done, the other will be free. Before I go on, I know that you may read this and think, boy this kid sure is edgy or sure gets irritated about a lot of stuff, and you know what? I DO! anyway, since I'm on this whole you know what I hate kick, I'll just tell you things that irritate me that have happened to me recently. For one thing, the battery in my watch went out this morning, and I went to buy a new battery for it today, but can't replace the old one cause I don't have a fucking screwdriver SMALL enough. So now I'm walking around campus wearing a watch that doesn't work and continuously looking at it to know the time. And every time I look at the damn thing, it's blank and I remember that it doesn't work I get mad at myself. And soda machines piss me off too cause every time I really thirst for a particular drink and push the button for that particular drink, I most always get something else. And of course you're left with this drink that you don't want, yet you don't want to just throw it away cause you just spent your last 00 cents on it. Anyway. . ok so how's the family? good? that's great. no serious0e0ly to continue the theme of today's "stream of consciousness" let's talk about music. Now, I listen to all kinds of music ranging from frank sinatra to Fear Factory, so I not judgmental in terms of genre of music, but my friends and I go out from time to time to see bands in LOCNAME perform that are, in our opinion good, without record deals much less ORGNAME support meanwhile talentless bands successful solely due to sex appeal (PROPNAME, No Doubt in particular) thrive. Now you may say, but PROPNAME what about the Spice girls do you hate them? And my answer oddly enough is no. Why? Cause they are all about sex appeal and they know it. PROPNAME and No Doubt actually think they're serious musicians. times up. 
__label__label0 I've never liked writing and any other literature stuff like reading. I also feel a bit different because I've never done my homework on the webpage before. It's a new thing for me. Everything in college feels different. The schedule is flexible; you can have classes from 00 to 00 and then jump to 0 to 0, not all continuously throughout the day. There's also the good thing that I don't have to go to classes I don't want to go to. This freedom of choice gives me a feeling of relaxation but also fear. I feel great that I can do whatever I want, but feel fearful that my choices might not be the best for me. This assignment gives me a feeling of nervousness. I hate writing, especially when I have a time limit on it. It's hard enough for me to come up with stuff to write about when I have plenty of time, and it gets harder when I have a time limit, whether or not that there is no right or wrong things to say. I feel like I'm saying many wrong things because a lot of this is not so much feeling but some experiences I went through in college. I can't write about my feelings for 00 minutes because it's hard to know what I'm feeling and even harder to write about it. 
__label__label0 I'm sorry, but I just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. Where does that come from?  What, is it inherited, or something?  Do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell?  I just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings?    I can't wait until it's my birthday. I can finally watch Titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. PROPNAME. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure PROPNAME. Ahhhh, pure heaven. I wonder how people like him handle their lives. I mean, I don't know what I would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. My life would change so much; I'm not sure if I would like it very much. I hate the media. They make so much out of the stupidest things. Why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money?  It just boggles my mind. It's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many "Smiths" there are in the world. O. K. So, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. Seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. And, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. Hell, even I do sometimes. All those sleazy magazines that say stuff like "see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 00 arms and 0 eyes. "  Crazy stuff like that. It's ridiculous. But, I must admit it is pretty humorous at times. I know when I'm in the grocery line, I browse over the titles just to get a laugh. I can't believe it's already 0:00. Where did the day go?  Why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. It's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the "time flies when you're having fun" does not necessarily pertain. Well, I guess it could. I don't know. All I know is that even when I'm not doing much, the days go by faster. That kind of scares me in a way. I have so much I want to do with my life, and what if one day I wake up and realize I haven't done a thing. I mean, what if I went to the doctor today, and they told me I only had 0 weeks to live?  Then, what would I do. I wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that I've always dreamed of. I wouldn't meet the man I am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. Three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. That's awful when people find out something like that. I couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. I still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 0 months to live, and he lived 0 years before he died. But, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning?  I remember the last time he went to the doctor's. He sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. First of all, how can any one approximate someone's life?  But, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 0 months to a year. He just shook his head, and said "no. That's not going to happen. "  He said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again. 
__label__label0 Entering a big campus with so many different people, how interesting. This will be kind of a new experience, meeting other students just as smart or even smarter. I can bring ideas to this school and to others as well as the school and students to me. Hopefully, I do well, or excel beyond my potential where I can feel proud and to just prove my abilities to myself. Things now are a little different, where I live, what I eat, who I meet. But it seems that everybody has to deal with the same things or hurdles in that everybody are fighting, scratching, or just competing to be the best or is everybody just content to making to college?  Due to their being content, the race for those competing will be easier for them, but are we in a rat race to achieve greatness?  There are also other things in life other thatn to prove that one person is somehow better academically because of a test made by some professor and to the subjects covered by what the professor says, there's to find leisure time when not having to study. School can be easily sluffed off, but students are paying for classes in which makes a person certified to do a job in which that person studied. Money don't grow on trees; people gots to earn it, to feel good about oneself. But it's also the little things that can a person feel good like just getting together with friends and talking, to eat something that's very tasteful, to just observe how folks interact with certain situations and how watching or observing these things can help me without me having to go through, but somethimes some things have to experienced by oneself to fully understand. Things aren't what they always seem just by loooking. College has too much to offer, where everything arent' feasible to understand, and just let things be. 
__label__label1 I am worried about how I can save my $00 until the end of September. I need to buy 0 books and groceries and personal stuff. I am thinking that I need to find a part time job somewhere on-campus very soon. I also feel guilty about not going home to my family over Labor Day. I know I should visit them but every time I spend long periods of time with them ie. days, they really start to piss me off and then I get into a bad mood. So instead of going to visit them over Labor Day I think I am going with some friends to visit some friends in LOCNAME. I miss my friends back home. This school is really big and sometimes I feel all alone. My classes are starting to stress me out, especially my rhetoric and composition class. I cannot write very well so I probably won't do well in that class. I feel like I'm writing in a diary which is wierd because I've never kept a diary contains all my thoughts and feelings. When I was little and had a diary I just wrote what I ate for lunch and who I sat and played with at reces or who I had a crush on. I just found a bobby pin in my hair from last night. That's kind of embarrassing, I hope no one saw it. I'm supposed to keep writing for ten more minutes but I don't really know what else to write. I have to e-mail my mom, cousin and some friends later. I hope my friend doesn't have to go to jail. No one has heard about his trial that was the other day. Maybe I'll call them later on and find out what happenned. I am so hungry. I can't wait for lunch. I son't know why I've been getting cravings for salty foods because usualy I would always look for ice cream, but lately I've had cravings for chex mix, pizza, chips and stuff like that. I hope I filled out the right pre-testing survey for psychology because I saw a button you click on in this web page, but this isn't the one that I went to. I forgot to bring a pencil with me. I wonder what my ex-boyfriend is doing now. I still miss him even though he was a big jerk and I really don't want to get back with him. I think people will always have feelings for their ex'es even long after they've broken up. I miss my sister too. We never really got along until about 0 or 0 months ago. I feel bad about never really being a nice sister. I always teased her and I knew it hurt sometimes. I wrote her a letter before I went to  college. I hope she's read it. I think I've been writing for 00 minutes but I'm not sure so I'll keep writing for two more minutes. hmm. well this kind of makes me feel better to let all of my thoughts out instead of keeping most of them inside my head. 
__label__label1 I just waited 00 minutes for a bus to come and pick me up from the nursing building. in the dark and I got very agitated and edgy. Every car of course had their headlights on and a million cars must have passed by me. I'm still seeing spots even now. I'm upset because I think everyone has forgotten me since I moved off to college. I guess they do. I do feel like a number here at LOCNAME despite what they say about getting involved. Every night I come home excited to see if I got any e-mails, messages or mail- but I hardly ever do. They're ALWAYS for my roommate. I still expect to wake up in the morning and see my old room at home, but I get a nasty feeling in my stomach when everything comes into focus and I realize that I'm in some unusual place. and then I realize its my dorm room. Everyone told me the first week would be toughest and that everything is downhill on an easy ride from there. But it isn't working that way for me. Everything is going WAY uphill and the climb is getting even harder than my first week. I want to go home next week and see my family and my dogs, but I know if I do I won't want to come back and it will be even worse than my first day here because I know how awful it can be now and I  will dread that returning again. I'll wait until I get on my feet to go back. Does this page keep moving down?  The phone just rang again and of course it was for my roommate. She has to call her mom when she gets back. Then she'll hog the phone until 00:00 tonight talking to everybody in the world and their dog. And when my mom calls for ME I'll have to call her back because my  roommate will be on the phone and by the time she's off, my mom will be in bed and it would be futile to try and call her back so late. I'm a very SLOW typer. I hope nobody is really reding this because they would think I was an absolute ogre. I'm really not. I put on a good front for other people. Everyone thinks I'm anorexic because they say "I'm a toothpick". If only they saw how much I eat. I hate being so skinny and being able to do nothing about it. Everyone wants to be skinny right?  But not to an extreme, right? I have loads of trouble finding clothes, I have to stuff myself till I practically pop at every meal so I don't lose any more weight. I'm sick all of the time, I can't excercise a lot or else I shed pounds and spend too much of my needed energy, my poor parents have to pay a fortune for heart surgery for me because my low weight has caused serious side effects. I've never been anorexic, bolemic or anything for that matter yet people automatically assume that I am. I noticed in that pre-testing, that a lot was aimed toward eating disorders. Yet everyone fails to notice that there are some of us out here who need help with feeling too skinny. How come larger people and insecure people always  get the help, when there's others out here who need some too. WE get tired of doctors shooing us away and finally don't do anything about it until the damage is already done, and it's not like we caused it to be that way like others. I miss my friends. I miss my family, and I'm signing off now because I'm getting really irritated.      
__label__label1 I think about my mother, my ex-boyfriend in LOCNAME(of whom I'm still in love with) and just things that are going on in my life right now. All of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming. And for some reason during all of this I listen to the most depressing PROPNAME PROPNAME or PROPNAME PROPNAME song. After a good cry I always feel better, I think it's healthy to cry though. I think it's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy. Dealing with things, for me, is the best way to get over them. But sometimes I tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out. I seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when I would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me. My parents got divorced at that time, about when I was 00 years old or so. I remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because I missed her. She and I have one of the best relationships I've ever seen between parent and child. She is my friend not just my mother. But I don't cross boundaries, I respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance. I think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit, use it to their advantage, I just respect it and cherish it with all my heart. I quote PROPNAME PROPNAME, "And I have the sense, to recognize, that I don't know how to let you go. "  I think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year. We've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other's lives at some point or another. I guess it's a good thing, he's a wonderful person and a great person for me. But I just don't know if I can do this (be in love with him have a relationship, what have you) with him being in LOCNAME and me here in LOCNAME. I don't know if I want him calling me telling me how much he misses me, and telling me he loves me when he's two hours away. I guess it's not that much of a distance compared to other people's long distance relationships, but I think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those. I certainly know they're not for me. And from his past experiences with them, all bad, I know he's not too keen on the idea either. I miss him terribly, touching him, smelling him, his humor, his voice, everything. E-mail and phone conversations don't suffice. I just got a LOCNAME laptop and I wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and I hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing. UGH!  I hate this thing, but I really don't I like having it to take to the library. I just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do. I'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things. They just don't interest me that much. I'm much more of a trial and error person. Except when it comes to math basically because I don't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out. I want a formula there for in my face. We're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now. It's a total bitch. I made three really cool friends in that class. One of my friends PROPNAME I saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together. I wish he were cuter, he's a really nice guy. And I made these two other friends PROPNAME(same name as my best friend) and PROPNAME. They're both really cute, and PROPNAME seems like she'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with. She was telling me about her cousin's friend who's gay and just moved to new LOCNAME to go into fashion. Imagine that. but I would love to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME. Especially after seeing that movie A Perfect Murder , I mean I know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on LOCNAME LOCNAME but I would love to just go visit it. I love the whole image of it, it's just very chic for some reason. I would live there if I could get a very high paying position somewhere, but that's the only way I would. it's just too crowded otherwise. 
__label__label1 I'm also, I just got interrupted by a friend of mine I always seem to run into someone when I'm in the computer lab she's in my Spanish class which is nice because she always makes me laugh I wish I could type I can't so this assignment is going very slowly for me anyway back to my friend she and I used to live together my freshmen year then over the summer we both went to the same language school in LOCNAME only I didn't know she was going to be there and vice versa we saw each other in the court yard of the school one day by chance it was pretty weird to go all the way to another country just to run into your housemate I'm pretty tired and these 00 minutes aren't going by very fast I need to get home so I can watch road rules but I don't know where to catch my bus which is a little comical considering that my 00 years old I should know how to use public transportation I don't though because I usually drive but the parking situation is so bad I would have to wake up at the crack of dawn to find a parking place even then it would probably take an act of God oh well I don't have to worry about that today I only need worry about finding my bus I think it's in front of jester I have a lot of classes in jester this semester which I don't like I hate that place it reminders me of my freshmen year not that I lived there it's just that it's such a freshmen place and it smells bad like a day care center ok I would like to apologize for that low blow I was a freshmen too once speaking of freshmen why given the parking problem are they allowed to have cars on campus that pisses me off 
__label__label1 I have too much to and not enough time to do it. I hate feeling stressed. I really wish that I could just snap my fingers and have everything be done for me. When I get like this I can't concentrate on anything else. I feel like I need to just start doing the things I need to do and everthing will be okay. I am also really tired, and I know that I am not going to be getting much sleep anytime soon. I am frustratd about my computer. I need toget everything hooked up but I have to wait until someone helps me. My roommate is very messy and I think I will not be able to handle it for much longer. I wonder why my parents haven't called, and what my boyfiend did last night. I am excited about this weekend. I can't wait until the football game. I am nervous about a Pre-cal quiz. I need to get a hold of my professor, but I don't know if I can. I also need to start reading. Too much to do and not enough time to do it. I should of prepared earlier. I'm trying to think about what else is going through my mind and I'm having troubles doing so because that's all I'm thinking about. I'm wondering how hard my classes are going to be. I am excited about this class and my speech class, but not chemistry and Pre-cal. I am reallt worried about my Pre-cal class I need to go to tutoring or something. I have 0 more minutes to type. I feel like I am different from some of the girls in my sorority, and that scares me. The whole sorority thing is overwhelming. Once everything gets started things could get better. I feel like I am writing in a diary that people are going to read. I think I worry too much. I wish that life could be easier. I feel sorry for my parents. I hate community baths. People should not be so gross and messy. I really just want to go back to bed. This assignment is done. 
__label__label1 dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream--  probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people I know really are, and especially the way that I feel about those people deep inside. I don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, I might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who I am. sometimes I admit that I am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes I admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things I didn't think I could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that I can feel for days. a lot of times I say that I am by nature an independent person, I work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but I'm not one of them. I do need my family and close friends-- I couldn't even think about living without them. but how would I be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but I have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again I guess for some "lucky" people they will never be left alone. I think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who I am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. I need to be my own person before I can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and I try to be, just not easily influenced. I try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that:  though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself. 
__label__label0 the channel is tuned to ORGNAME; so there must not be anything better to watch at midday. However, being inside watching crap on the television is better than sitting outside in the Hellish heat. When will the madness stop. I write these words in between my 0D design studio class at the art building in the morning and my psychology class at 0:00 PM. Myb studio class starts at 0 AM, way too early. I write from my apartment in south LOCNAME. I get back and forth between school and my apartment by way of Capital metro. The bus is convienent  but not so convienent. I don't too much like this computer or any computer for that matter. Technology  one day my ruin the human race, we'll have to see. At the moment technology seems to be our best friend, our idle, and to some our lover. That last group of people don't really exsist. Materialism is the Western way of life. This is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. Some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. We need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. I would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. But what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. This is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily  to subsitute for personal contact. We continue to amase ourselves with new toys, but someday we might second guess our advancements. 
__label__label1 I have a lot of work I need to get done with today, and for some reason I'm kind of I the mood to do my homework. You don't know me so you don't know how uncommon this kind of mood is for me. It's like when I finally decided to clean up my room, and it was just so satisfying to get the job done. I already went home for a weekend, and I went straight to my room just to look at how clean it is. It's a very satisfying feeling to know that it's that clean because of me. I kind of miss my family, my friends, my life before I got here. And I just can't stop thinking about this. Today I was walking with my boyfriend, and this guy that I thought was really cute saw me walking with him. It's not like I was planning on dumping my boyfriend for this random guy, but I wouldn't have minded if he hadn't necessarily known that I was attached. Maybe I could've had some fun. But really I truly love my boyfriend, but things are going well, but they could always end up changing. My goal is just that I don't want to miss out on anything in college. I want to date around while I've go the chance. if some guys want to date me, that is. Tonight I'm going to this thing, I can't remember the name of it though: it's like the Christian organization for the whole campus. I'm not really sure how into it I'll be. I go to church and teach Sunday school, or at least I used to. I haven't gone to church in LOCNAME yet, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. But I don't know if this Christian thing is my kind of thing. I'm not one of those people that likes to go around trying to get people to take God into their lives. That's their choice as far as I'm concerned. I mainly decided to go to this meeting to meet some new people, and so I could do something since PROPNAME's going to be so busy today with his computer science homework. I can't complain too much though because if it wasn't for PROPNAME I wouldn't have computer up and working. I was getting kind of frantic about this assignment. I just wanted to get it done, but I just didn't have everything together. Right now I'm becoming all impressed with my typing skills. I have to look at the keyboard the entire time, but I can press the keys pretty fast. I'm quite pleased. On Saturday I'm going out to one of my family's lake houses. It's on LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they are about to sell it which makes me pretty sad. I love that place mainly cause it is so unique to have a place like that to go to. It's sad because I didn't realize how lucky I was to have that so I didn't always go when I  had the chance and it's so nice and peaceful. There's another lake house on PROPNAME PROPNAME and I really o prefer that one, but I'd rather them not sell either one. People are like protesting the sell of this property because we're selling it to developers, and that makes all of the neighbors angry. I can understand that, but I have no part in the decision making. But at least for part of this weekend I won't be stuck eating crappy Jester food. I think I'm almost to tw0enty minutes, and I kind of feel bad because I don't feel like I just wrote what came to mind. It seems planned for some reason, UT I never paused this whole time, I just kept typing and would always seem to come up with something to say, well I guess it's good-bye until my next assignment, but now I'm wondering if my assignment is as long as everyone else's. Maybe I type slower than them and maybe it hasn't quite been twenty minutes. I can't exactly remember when I actually started this, but I kind of do need to go because I have plenty of Calculus homework to do. It's not like you're even going to read this, but I'm still kind of nervous. oh well, I'm going to say I'm done now. 
__label__label0 Two people, both human in their thoughts--both flattering and otherwise--probably can tell what the other might be thinking yet they refuse oh, fuck it, this is a boring fucking topic, let's move on. She flew in front of the rushing, in front of the huge tidal wave that sucked up the ocean and spat it out like a great hydrant unleashed. Everywhere were sparks of water drops, falling all around as if the sky had let some of its most prized stars fall to the earth for a short while. Pumping harder and faster in and out of the water like the wheels of a railroad made of air and invisible fire that could burn. So quickly was the pumping that the body never knew exactly when it was in water or air but letting the mind rest so that it didn't have to think about the possibility of its limbo state. Higher, faster, higher, faster, stretch, stretch, stretching for something with the next heave. Perhaps beyond this star-surrounded existence there was something more, something past the huge roaring of a thousand waves chasing. If the body could just stretch a little more, jump higher, breath with the vigor that said "what's next?". something might answer back. The sun would set itself on the sheet of a mirror made of those drops of stars and welcome the body and the attached mind into the core of-- of what?  Faster still, plunge, plunge, plunge to the rhythm of the thousand and one gadgets held somewhere between the awkward wave machine and the diving body. Maybe the answer was somewhere behind the body, maybe if it would just stop long enough the gadgets would swallow it up, the flat cold would open its innards and let the body know that all the time what it was leading was the salvation, the euphoric "YES!" it was looking for. But too much of a chance, the gadgets were probably chasing after the sun just like the body was. If not then why was it always following the dolphin forward. The dolphin continued its unceasing breath. Felt the crash, the massage, the spank, the kiss of the sea as it plunged under once again. Where was the sun?  Why didn't it show itself?  Faster, faster, enjoying to the fullest the sound of a thousand gidgets singing in a rhapsody of mixed chorus like the sound of the wind against the leaves and sand of those strange dry places where creatures coo and lie in the sun. Chasing the sun; if only the dolphin could call it. The dolphin was sure it didn't see it now. A few bleating cries, mixed with loneliness and bittersweet joy, the loneliness from being just behind the gears that all shared in their lives together and worked as if one, the joy of those drops, those thousand, star-filled drops that seemed too beautiful and quick to stay on the mirror waves long. The joy too, of feeling the waves rush up and pull and then give and pull and give all the while trying to stay just above, just beyond, further and further away if only to KNOW. For if life chasing the sun proved this-- this-- MUCH; this fullness that almost filled the body and the attached mind until it could almost hold no more except for that damn persistent hole that often slid part of the fullness down, then can one imagine what life in the sun might prove to be?  Bathed in the stars that only manage to peek out every once in a while in the disguise of sea foam?  Full of that diving feeling without having to take rushed breath?  Part of those lucky gadgets that can never envision loneliness because they are constantly surrounded by the humming that they make together in chorus?  The sun is slipping now, disappearing too quickly, lungs almost tear in the attempt to keep up, tail flipping sporadically, waves going by so fast they feel like hot coals searing the flesh. No, no, no, NO!  Gone now, a last sliver to leave in the mind of the dolphin to remind the body tomorrow, if the sun comes down to gather up its star-drops, of how close it came and how one day it would find a shortcut, a way to escape the in between limbo that held just enough splendor to incite the imagination. Deeper now and beside the humming gadgets who now are singing a softer chorus, like the cluck-cluck of a mother to child to soothe it to bed. This was the best part of the day, the calmness afterward, the coolness, the memories and the dreams. "Hey dad?" "Yeah?" "Why do dolphins swim in front of ships?" "Hmm, I dunno'" "They're beautiful, huh?" "Yeah, they sure are. " "I love the way the sun reflects off their skin. " "Yep. "     
__label__label0 Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. PROPNAME, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 00 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy "Titanic. "  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her "No. "  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will "turn into" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     
__label__label1 I don't know how other people (freshmen) are coping with this new transition from high school to college; I feel stress out. Hmm. maybe I'm not so completely at ease like I had claimed earlier. I suppose that I am at ease at this moment is because I don't have any class to go to for hours, and that I think I am at ease right now, is because this is the second week of classes. However, I'm still stress, very much so. (I feel like I'm rambling on and on here. ) I am so very much relief that I have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments. I like to try to do things ahead of time so that I won't be in any jams later on. Besides, what with the way my schedule is set, I have to budget my time wisely. Moreover, I am worried that I won't be able to get high grades as I did when I was in high school. Everything in college is so very different and challenging. Sometimes, I feel as if I can't keep up with other people. I admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them. I just can't do that. I'm the type that has to put in "extra work" so that I can keep up with them. I'm not saying that I'm stupid, gosh no! I believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways. Hmmm. there is one thing, rather, one small minor fear  that I just can't seem to overcome: fear of animals, especially dogs. Well, I took the pretest and in there, it had asked me questions about animal phobia. I really want to know what these fears mean, which brings me to another thought. I always have questions, such questions that are so detailed some people called it "stupid questions. " I always find myself having questions about everything. I guess  I'm just a curious person. Hmmmm. I guess this is enough typing for this assignment. I can't think of anything else to write about. Who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment, I'm sorry it isn't anything that is as exciting as you'll like it to be. 
__label__label1 I have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. I am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. It was full though, so I signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled "Introducion to Italian Culture," but I dropped it this morning, because I think it is so irrelevant to anything I am interested in, and I am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. I was signed up to take 00 hours, but since I droppped that seminar, I now have only 00 hours. Anyway, I am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is "Interior Design. "  I'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but I just thought that is worth a shot. I am sitting in my dorm, ORGNAME ORGNAME, right now, and I just figured out how to use their computers here. I did not bring my own computer, so I am having to use the computers here. I still do not know how to check my email yet, though. I just figured out how to be able and send email from here. My roommate does have a computer, but I can tell that she would prefer it if I didn't use her's, so I respect that. She has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. We knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. I was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but I think taht it will work out fine. One of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. She is the one who I am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. She got into that class. Anyway, in the dorm that I am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. PROPNAME, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. The part that I live in is bigger, but I kind of wish that I lived in the other part. The people that I live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. Oh well, I'm over across the street a lot, so I guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. I am so excited that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is starting tonight. It is a bible study that I am going to go to. I've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. I miss all of the Christian based things that I went to bakc at home. I used to go to Campus Life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. I also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. She is not much older than I am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that I go through. Not taht I have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. Speaking of problems, I did get really homesick the other day. Obviously, I guess you can tell that I am a freshman. Anyway, I got sick , adn any time I am sick I always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. But, I managed just fine. I went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and I am feeling much better today. I still am really tired though. I think that might have been why I got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. Well, I have finished the twenty minutes, but I'm sure taht this is horribly written, but I guess it doesn;'t matter. 
__label__label1 Why do I always analyze things to the point that I completely stress myself out about it?  I find myself doing this time and time again.   I feel stupid, I can't believe that I let PROPNAME set me up on a date with someone that I don't even know. To top that, I barely know her. What was I thinking? The way that she is talking, he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever seen; however, I am really scared that I am going to be really let down. I know that sounds really negative, but I guess it sounds too good to be true. It doesn't make sense to me how this whole thing works anyways. Your sorority tells you about a party that they are having, giving you only two days notice to find a date. To me that is completely weird. I just don't have the guts to go up to some random guy and ask him to go to something that I'm not even sure will be fun myself. Oh well, it will all work out.   Now, on the other hand, I'm all about going to the pledge line tomorrow. I couldn't believe that someone asked me. It made me feel so good inside to know that I was one of the few girls to get asked!    I don't know what my problem is; it just seems like I can't stop thinking about how much weight I think that I need to lose. It seems to be the only thing that I think about any more, and I don't know why. I don't think that there is anything wrong with me, but then again, maybe there is . You never can tell any more.   All I know is that there are so many things going on and not enough time. I wish that my body wouldn't go through such big "swings". One minute I am bursting with energy, and the next I can't even keep my eyes open. It is as if a person is holding onto my heels and making me drag them for hours on end. After dragging them for so long, you just can't drag any more. This tiredness that sweeps over me comes frequently throughout the day, but , without fail, it comes each day between 0pm and 0pm. I want to be like others that are comstantly energetic, skinny, and seem to get everthing done with no problems at all. I guess that is only a perception in my mind that only sees things from the outside instead of how they really are. Does that make sense?     Why can't there be more hours in the day. I feel like ever since I have gotten here, all the time in my day has flown by, and comtinues to fly by without even slowing down. Which is fine with me as long as I don't leace things that are really important to me out. Unfortunately, this is what I have been forced to do because I my new schedule.    Before I came to school, I worked out daily so that I could relieve all of my stess, and feel good all at the same time. Now I can't even find time to get to class--much less work out.   I wonder how PROPNAME is. Is such a sweet little boy. Ever since he was born I have loved those kids, and had a compassion for them that no one else could ever have.    I can't believe that PROPNAME came up to me and asked me about PROPNAME PROPNAME the other day. I mean talk about digging up painful things that have already been buried!! Whenever she said something, every bit of hurt and anger inside of me came back like it was just yesterday that it had happened.   I need to put it past, and forgive and forget. That is at least what I know I am supposed to do, but it is so hard! Why do I get attached to people so easily? That is one thing even I will never know. 
__label__label0 I got back yesterdayform LOCNAME , from my cousins wedding. it was agreat. we parited so hard I think I have to fo into detox for a while. it sucks because now I'm back at school and its time to study and get the grades. mami and pai keep telling me I  have to do good but as if I ddnt lknow that already. they think that I'm some kind of schmuck who doent know what he is doing. i  mean I'm nineteen years old , I'm in college they would at least trust me a little b\it to do good. its actuallty funny the fact that they worry more about the way I'm keeping my room than my grades. i like her.

__label__label0 Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group ORGNAME people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside ORGNAME my world at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards PROPNAME, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of LOCNAME. Coming from LOCNAME, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?  It's not that I'm depressed or willing to let go of PROPNAME to free myself of these "troubles," it's just that I want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just "click together. "  Too optimistic, I know. That'slife, I know, but I can still wish that things could be different. I never tyhought I'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. In a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. I guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. But, I've still got troubles. God, I sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually having a pretty good time. I have made friends, and I relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. I truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. Damn, I've got to wake up early tomorrow. I wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life!  My twenty minutes is almost up, and I really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.  
__label__label0 The reality that college isn't just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that I have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. I think somewhere in my mind I thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there'e more free time. Well, I know now that this will not be so. All my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. I'm really afraid that I won't know what to expect on examinations. I've spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can't imagine what I'm going to do. Reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. I also started reading my Economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that I recognized as being covered in class. I've discovered that going out every night and staying out until 0:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. The first week of school I tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. There are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and "party" and meet people every night. Externally, I'm a member of a sorority and we're supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. Internally, I feel like I'm missing out or something if I don't go. Maybe there's a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. I ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of ORGNAME that I had met at Orientation. We recognized eachother and talked for a minute. A couple days later I saw him in my EConomics class. It would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. But, great things like that usually don't happen to me. My roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. I really like them a lot. We all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. Everyone is so nice and we get along well. I especially like my roommate. We have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. We aren't in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together. Last night we stayed in and worked on our psych pretesting which took me like two hours after the UT football game. We were pretty bummed that they lost. 
__label__label0 At the moment I I can seem to think about is how strange it is to think about what I'm thinking about. I'm not really sure if I can truley display my thoughts if that's what I'm concentrating on instead of letting my mind wander subconsiously. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but it does to me. I'm trying to fight the temptation to go back and reword/correct sentences. Its very strange. I'm also trying not to have more than a two seconds pause between words/sentences so that I can show a true, 00 minute, unbroken stream of thought. I can't , unfortunately, fight the urge to correct typos - its natural for me to press the delete key the oment I see a mistake pop up on the screen. It will be interesting, however, to read this when I'm finished and see how many mistakes I missed. My roomate just put a CD on that I haven't heard in a long time - it makes mee think about highschool (the last time I listened to this)  what is it called?   . Oasis I think  you, and the name of the song is "Wonderwall"  I sincerely hope that its just a TA reading this and not Dr. PROPNAME because I'll probably be embarrased at my grammar usage/sentence structure, ect. ect. Did you know (I'm sure you do) that "etcetara" is Latin for "and so forth"  I know this because I took Latin in high school. It was a complete waste of time. I only got little useless trivial pieces of infromation out of it. Thought my favorite insult is still "habitas familia in miser villa" (you and your family live in a miserable farmhouse)  Our teacher left midway through our senior year and so they had a spanish teacher named Mr. PROPNAME teach the class. Kind of funny because he didn't know Latin, but hey, actually knowing the language is just optional right?  Latins dead anyway. hehe  It just occured to me that this is actually how I type a , drat, phone. k, that was my girlfriend, PROPNAME. we're not having the best of time, though I'm sure (I hope) we'll work it out. I pondered writing during the phone conversation but that would be weird (especially for PROPNAME) because I seriously doubt I can type and talk at the same time. unless I type giberish. or talk giberish; either of which would be bad in their own right. what was I talking, er. tyiping about before?  I actually had to scan up the page to read and remember - it was email. I was thinking about how I actually type a lot of emails like this - not really without thinkg about what I'm saying and not looking for grammar and all that but just typing continously. Usually because I'm emailing like 0 different people and it takes to long and its annoying. speaking of annoying, this is taking a long time  Its amazing how long 00 minutes can go by when you're thinking what else you could be doing. we're going to play risk in about 00 minutes. I love Risk. I'm not sure really, there's just somethin strangely fun about taking over the world. I also play this game on my computer called "Civilization, Call to Power" which is wonderfullly complex and very challenging. You build a civilization from 0000bc to 0000ad and either try to beat the computer opponents economically and in number of scientific andvances (kind of on a point system) or attempt to take over the world. In my currect game I have eliminated 0 of the 0 computer oppents and I'm going for the kill on my last enemy, the Persians. I made the mistake of using nuclear weapons and now my populace is very angry at me because of nuclear fallout and all that garbage. How many people have actually tried to take over the world?  0?  PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. All failed. I wonder if its even possible. Probably not, especially when your enemies have nukes. Nukes are kind of scary, I try not to think about them. Ok, thats 00 minutes FINALLY!

__label__label0 Right now I feel really happy and anxious because my family is coming to visit me. I miss them so much. This morning I felt different because they called me last night to tell me that they were not going to be able to come. This morning they called me to tell me they were anyways. Now I feel much better. I even felt like eating. There are mornings when I don't have an apetite. I have been thinking about college lately. I like it here but there are sometimes when I feel lonely. I wish I was with my family. But, I guess I have to learn to be by myself so I can know myself better. Lately I have been thinking about transfering to UTA. But I fear that my classes won't transfer. I really have to think about this one really carefull. Right now I also feel a little worried because I have so much homework to do. I don't even know where to start. Right now I feel like talking to my friends from high school but I don't have their phone numbers or their emails. I wish I could talk to a few of them, to see how they are doing and what their plans are for the future. I never thought that this assignment will be so easy. The thing that I most hate is this kind of assigment because I run out of things to say (like right now). Oh, today is my mom's birthday. This was one of the things I was sad about, yesterday. This would have been the first time I would have been away from home on her birthday. I really would like the 00 minutes to be over right now because I have a lot of stuff to do. The past two weeks I have notice how important TV is for me. I have to plan all of my life around TV. I can wait untill tonight when I get to watch my favorite program. I wish I could be someone famous right now. I don't care if is a model, actress, dancer or whatever but I would like to be famous. I also would like to live in LOCNAME. This summer was the first time I ever visited LOCNAME and loved it with all my heart. Hope one day I will move there and be like all the people from there. They all look like models, beautiful and well dressed. They all have incredible cars and clubs and restaurants. I can't wait untill November when I go to PROPNAME PROPNAME's concert, its going to be incredeble. 
__label__label0 okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 0-0:00 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :0:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute 
__label__label0 I am often asked what I am thinking about at the moment and I can never put them into words or many time I don't' want to but I guess I am forced to right now. I am at home right now for the labor day holiday and all I've been doing is homeowrk. Whoever said that college was going to be fun was wrong. or so I think. I'm constantly going to classes and when I'm not I'm doing homework related to it. Well I guess I can't say that college is all bad. I have been to my share of parties and those are always fun except for soem of the people you meet. Especially those stupid thug guys who think they are all that. They walk aroung with their pants about to fall off with their friends talkign abotu how many girls they are going to sleep with this year. And what the funny aprt is, spome of the girls are actually attracted to those greasy guys. They are constantly after then and soem of them even fight over them. Some of these guys have been in jail like 0 times and can barely even read. DOn't these epople ever wonder about what they are going to do with thte rest of their life or is that just a foriegn concept that they just can't learn? I don't' know why I am bitching about this, I just find it a little ridiculous how girls are always chasing after guys who are idiots. And besides that why are girls always trying to impress guys. I don't know why I'm going off abotu this. I'm not a feminist who is totally against guys or anything. Actually I'm the total opposite. But anyways, when ever I'm asked to talk abotu what I'm thinking about I go blank. I can't seem to think abotu anything. But one thing has coem to me. My aunt was ina coma for over a year and dies justa couple of months ago. I always think abotu her and my uncle and cousin. I feel so bafd for my cousin. he is only 0 years old and he is never going to get to know his mother. A lot of us take that forgranted and that really irritates me. I am HIndu and we believe in reincarnation and when soemthing horrible happens it makes you wonder what happened in past lives to cause he such misery. We believe that you are punished for your wrongdoings in your next life but life does improve for you every time. Supposedly you becoem a better person each time and everyone works towards a common goal and that goal is to be truly happy, just and basically as close to perfect as you can get. Every life makes you better and helps you move closer to that goal. But of coarse it takes more times for some than others, I think. Lately I have been discussing my religion a lot. I met this guy who never knew anyone who was HIndu. He just found that so fascinating and I couldn't believe that someone had never met a HIndu. That kinda shows how segregated we all are and how we tend to stay within our same culture and try not to stray to far from it. I mean I have many friends who are not LOCNAMEn and I have no prooblem with any kind of race, but I do have to admit that I do tend to be better friends and stay closer to those of the smae culture. I think this is true of a lot of peopel and not just me. But there are very few who are willing to accept this fact. One thing that does annoy me abotu this is how some people treat me liek I'm stupid until they learn that I was born in LOCNAME. I see a lot of racism with my parents because they do have an accent and that really gets me mad. If anyone is ever disrespectign my mother in front of me I will let them know and trust me I am not soft spoken. I don't' know where people get off thinking that they are better than us. My parents came from India with very little money and now if I may say so my self we are probably more successful than those fools who feel that they have to show that they are better than us. Anyways, on to a more lighter topic, psycology. have I mentioned that I think that it is one of my favorite classes even though there is 000 people in it. And I'm not just saying it to suck up or anything but I really do enjoy it and I look forward to comign to it everytime. Its not one of those boring classes where all we do is sit there and take notes. even with such a big classthere is a lot of interaction which is really important to me. Well my time is up. 
__label__label1 Well, I really don't know what to talk about now. I can't really think of what I am feeling. I guess relaxed and at the same time stressed. I have so much chaos in my life now that I can't even think straight. I just moved to a new city and a new home. I joined a soroity where I am suppose to meake all new friends in 0 week or less. I have a boyfriend that is non-exsistent in my life now. I have school work that I don't even know how to work on. I am just a mess. I am going home next weekend so maybe that will calm my nerves. I was very much overwhelmed when I came here about 0 weeks ago. I wasn't ready at all for this new experience in my life. I was but I wasn't at the same time. I was so ready to leave my parents but not to be on my own all the time. I sometimes feel depressed that I have no life but in actuality I really have it the best. I am waiting for my "boyfriend" to come and see me tomorrow. I have been waiting for 0 weeks. Don't know how long it will last. There are a lot of guys here that are also interested. I don't know. One minute I feel upset and just want to cry and roll up and the next I just want to go out and have so much fun. I miss my parents and brother so much. My dogs are also important to me and I dearly miss them. In high school I never use to study and now I am forced to or I will fail. Which the tachers don't give a crap about if anyone fails or not. In high school they did. I have so much to get use to and I am scared to tell the truth. I don't know why this is a question because no one will read this so I won't get into a lot. I am having fun though. I have met some really cool people and I know we will be friends for a long time. My soroity has also been a big aspect in my life right now. AEPhi is the name of it. I feel comfortable there and I know I will enjoy it immensley. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. I hope everything will turn out for the better and I can realx and actually enjoy myself and everyone else. 
__label__label0 I am so tired. I cannot wait to go home tomorrow and sleep in my own bed. I really didn't think I would miss home that much, but apparently I do. Seriously, I cannot wait to go in the car and drive back to LOCNAME. But it's not like I am homesick. Well, actually I guess I am homesick, but it's not for my family. To be quite honest, everytime I talk to my mother, she annoys me. But what I do miss is my bed. Not the house, because we don't' live in the house anymore. NO, we have to move two months before I leave for college. What were my parents thinking???  Obviously they weren't. But I do miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really want to go back to MY room. But, now I have no room. Honestly, I do not consider my dorm room MY room. Thinking of, I definitely need to bring back some more stuff. Pictures and frames - stuff like that. My room mate brought so much crap. It makes my side of the room look so bare. But at the same time, I DID bring a lot of stuff. Anyways, this weekend. My date with PROPNAME. I really don't want to go at all. I know that I completley led him on. I mean I could have told him that I was joking, but I didn't. I basically told him that I liked him. BUT PROPNAME PROPNAME! - UGH!  I still sound like I am totally in highschool. I know that in college you are supposed to throw away all your passt conceptions of people, but how can I do that about the guy who teased me for like 0 years. How many times can you say, "But Mr. PROPNAME, I'm only eleven?"  and think it to be funny. I swear in seventh grade I could have shot him and PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME is another boy, who I would never ever date. When he got to be such a heart throb in high school is beyond me. But then again, I never ever thought that I would have a crush on PROPNAME. I am such a hypocrit. The amount of time I was telling PROPNAME, not to like him and not to go for him. But then again, PROPNAME and PROPNAME would not have lasted anyways. Gio is so prude, PROPNAME would have either dumbed her or cheated on her pretty quickly. Gosh, I really hope that this assginment is completion, or else you will think that I am a really shallow and superficial person. Not to meniton judgemental. But actually what can you expect coming from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME - thrid snobbiest school in the nation???  I seriously had fun at high school, but it definitley was a different type of fun than the type of fun I'm having now. I mean in high school I hardly ever drank really, until my senior year. But even then it wasn't EVERY weekend like I do now. I mean, we used to do stupid stuff like go to the airport and play airport tag, wrap or in the case of PROPNAME "condimenting" houses. But now, it's frat parties every weekend. Not that I am complaining, because I am hanging out with PROPNAME - what a hottie. But he is so rude. and PROPNAME - honestly, I havent' talked to her since 0th grade. It is so wierd how people who were so close are now so far appart. But anyways, maybe the frat parties and the drinking is what is making me so tired, because I am pretty sure that I had less sleep that I am having now in highschool. Is this even stream of consciousness??? I ended up talkign about the same thing I began with, but I guess it is because I did go off on several tangents. But oh well - time's up! 
__label__label1 How am I going to do? Who am I? How do I compare to everyone else around me? So many questions yet no answers. I'm hopig to have fun and enjoy my experiences. Is my family thinking of me? I hope all is well with them. Expressing my feelings and thoughts on paper is hard to do. Am I doing this right? I don't no what I'm doing really. In school that is. Don't know if I'm able to be successful. Wait,m I know I can be successful. just have to dig down deep inside and find meyself. So lost without God and best freind. Dpn't know what the futre holds or what will happen. Kinda scared and hesitant. I want to love my job and my family. I want so many things for my life and I want to fullfill my goals. I want to be a rockstar. To see crowds of people go crazy at the sight of me. Who doesn't though? Maybe its just a dream. I feel destined to have a career in music. My only escape frpm life itself is music mostly guitar. I want to makee a differece in my society. To figure out where humans came from and to answers questions about life. But who doesn't want to do that? I want to stand out. I want to be a hero in my society and a mentor amongst my peers. I want poeple to remember me for the rest of time. For the good things that I've done. For differences that I've made in peoples lives. I want to lead my friends to PROPNAME and show them how wonderfull it is to be a christian. my life is wonderful and I sometimes take for granted all that I have. Sometimes I realize much I regret some of the things I have done. Time can change me, but I can't change time. Well, I think its been 00 mins. Later. i'm out 
__label__label1 I notice that my mind always wonders off to the things in my life that I wish were better. I tend to think about the differences between what I should be doing in my life right now, and what I am doing. I also find that one person in particular continues to pop into my head, a girl no less, one that I knew about a year ago, only for a brief period of time, but I miss her every day. I also have thoughts of longing to be back home, with my mom and my dogs. I miss high school. I built up a large list of friends over a span of twelve years, and now all of a sudden I'm starting from scratch again. Like kindergarten in a way. I also feel the pressure of my mouting homework that continues to pile up, atop of which sits two gigantic architecture projects, both of which are do in a shorter amount of time then I am capable of finishing them in. Life is getting harder. Being a kid was so easy. I want to be a rock star. the path was set, my band was doing great, writing songs, about to cut our first albm, when college ripped us apart. Nothing makes sense anymore. Take me home. 
__label__label0 right now I'm a little bit stressed anb  about getting all my homework done that is do on friday due tommorrow  and getting enough sleeop at the same time  never enough time   too much to due too little time  I also need to clean up my room and do the dishes. I should also say that I only have one arm to type this because the other one is in a cast so I probably wont write as much as everyone else. although have a lot of homework to do tonite, I'm happy because I only have one class tomorrow and then the weekend is here and I don't have any classes to go to. I'm also happy that this is such an easy assignment and that we get credit for it. my roomate is bothering me quite a bit at the moment cause he wont shut up. I really don't like him very much, but at least he is just my roomate and I don't have to hang out with him. now I hope that he doesn't see what I wrote. I'm excited about this weekend cause it will be time to get away from school. I don't know or care what I'm doing though. maybe I shouldnt feel this way so early in the year, but I just don't feel like doing all of the work I have to do for school, I would rather just sit in the living room and watch tv and relax. I'm tired now and I feel like going to sleep, but the nthought of my math hw wont let me relax until it is all done. now I'm wondering if someone is actually going to read all of these writing assignments, I feel sorry for whoever has to do that, but I guess they are divided up between the ta's. my twenty mins is almost up so I'm thinking about what I'm goin g to write for the next ass. well twenty mins is up now, so goodbye. 
__label__label0 Hello. My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I'm a freshman this year. So far I love ut and I'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and I actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing I really fear is that I will slack off. I am great at doing my work, and I know that I will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, I have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, I'm not homesick at all. I'm actually doing very well here. I met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that I've come close to two of the people that I met. one of which I am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. I finally gained the confidence in myself and I gained so much to my self esteem. On a normal, day to day basis, I try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever I'm feeling down. My friends and  family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone I love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when I have a problem, and I know that. He's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when I left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, I've recieved about 0 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. I'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. I am so proud of being indian, and I'm also very proud to be part of the family that I'm in. I wouldn't change that at all. I grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. I like growing up there, but I really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way I'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone I need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something I really wanted. I wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. I had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. I love it. I like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, I love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when I went to new york city a couple of years ago, all I wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, I like to live life like that. doing things I by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. I've always been independent and I'm fairly sure that's becuase I take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because I'm the older child. I like doing things on my own, so then I know if I make a mistake, I can fix it. I don't like depending on others all the time, but I love being with people. I know those are two contradicting statements but I do have those that I rely on, and I do consider connections when I need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, I love my life. I can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and I want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and I hope to succeed with great pride. 
__label__label1 I just got up and now I have to finish all these dumb writing assignments. I haven't taken a shower yet, and I'm not really in the mood to finish these things, but they're due tomorrow, so I have to finish these. I think I'm going to go workout later today. I want to be in shape for the crew team. I've noticed myself getting a lot better like being in better cardiovascular shape. that's cool. I haven't played soccer in a while, so it feels good doing something athletic again. hopefully, I'll get in some major shape in not too long. I still have so much homework to do. this really sucks. This weekend was pretty fun I guess. We went to this Iron Spikes party friday night. There were some pretty cute girls there. I almost went home with one girl but I don't think she is that cute. I did have some pretty thick beer goggles on so I don't really know if she was as good looking as I thought. OH well. That just shows my dedication to crew. IF I give up getting some, then being on the crew team must be very important to me. I felt like I was in too. This girl was just absolutely digging me. that's a shame. and then on saturday, I went to a lakehouse, that was a) neither a on a lake b) not even a house. it was a freakin stream-creek apartment. that sucked. These girls that were there were pretty annoying. ONe was really cute, but she was kinda snobbish. I dunno. I'd like to talk to her, but these girls were all too snobbish for me. I was hoping maybe there would be some down to earth girls but apparently not. I hope I meet a good girl pretty soon. I want a girlfriend, but I think I'm trying too hard. I should just chill and hopefully one will bite me in the butt soon. Oh My God! I still have a few minutes to go here, but this is taking forever. Let's see. i have economics, calculus, chemistry, and then of course this class. I kinda want to just stop and go workout and then go out tonight to makeup for that bunk night last night. It sucked. We were supposed to spend the night there last night, but we ended up going home, because quite frankly, it sucked. we didn't do anything, but drink and then just talk. These girls would talk about absolutely nothing. they had no brains. just a bunch of hot air. it was so very boring talking to them. hopefully next week though, it will get a LOT better. I mean it only goes up from here. that was absolutely horrible. I am not in the mood to do any homework at all. 
__label__label0 I have a stuffy head and runny nose, and I have to carry cleanex around with me and it;s kind of embarassingf to vlow your nose in class and its feels gross and clogged. I look for nice looking peoople to sit next to in class and I feel like eceryione feels the same way about being here, like its all brand new and and no one is totally comftorable and we're all looking for a place to be comftorable. there are a bunch of girls around her ea and its funny how little contact with guys I've had in the past couple of weeks. I miss the guys in knew and was friends with in highschool and danny but I don't really miss him, but id like to see him again and talk to him. the guys here are pretty much attractive but I guess that since I'm in a new world I walk around t\afraid to talk to anyone really except for nice looking girls. I've met people, but I am totally stressed out and I'm going a bunch of different directions, and I can't focus on anybody and I can't calm myself down. veronica is comingf up today or tomorrow for a visit and I wonder how it will be especially since I've been so stressed out. I can't believe I slept for over nine hours and I don't feel completely rested. it totally understand how people pay for caffeine pills here, because this is only the third day of class. excercise will help relieve my stress I think, so I'm going to kickboxing in a little while. the only thing about that is I don't even know where the damn building is, and I have to run past this strange campus past a million strange people to take a brand new class I've never been to, and I;ll probably feel guilty because I haven't even started to stud0y yet. I know ill be ok but right now I'm making it very hard for myself to have much fun. I wonder what I'll we'll do tonight? I really want a zeta to call me and ask me to go out. even though its c razy I would have loved to be dragged out of bed and taken out to eat at six in the morning, but no one every came for me, and as far  as I know no one ever called for me either. its a good thing because I needed to work out and sleep like I did and not drink. its even a wednesday and they took us out to party hardy, I don't know how these fgirls can run, because they even look fgood and have boyfriends and make food grades and go out and study and sleep. I guess its all time management and I'l;ll e\definately be forced to learn it, at least I have tom ake mysels learnit ior ill go crazy. I want to go call a zeta and hjand out with her because we will be friends one day and probably be partyingh together four years from now, hopefully. I think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. I don't know how much I would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people I had met from being a part of it. it think  it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully I;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career. I have to miss the first ut football game!!I wish the zetas had a section, but maybe I can go to the tailgate party anyway if I find someone to go with, and veronica will bve here. I hope when she leaves I don't geet homesilck like I did nwhen momm and the fgirls came up. I can't believe I've really only talied to daddy once since I left san antonio. he sent me a nice letter and a nicer jchekc but too bad that a hundred dollars won;t go to o fast. being at ut in austin I dfeel like I'm in a totally different world, and I ,\can really see whant they meant about not having the time or interest to go visit other campuses. I just htought about how much fun it will be to go to aand m tosee the cross country team run, but it feels like it would take monumental organization and effort to bget up there, especially not having a car. onely four more minutesleft to type. imi liking this assignment because it reminds me of the creative writing class wiht mrs cummings nadnd how I enjoued myself in there and the free writings we would have which got easier and easier to do as the time went on, and I culd see myself more and more on the paper,and the way my thoughts went. I really like journaling but its uncomfroable to werite and I walways stop to do it late at night when I'm tired and if I do it in the morning it is eems like I get latzy and don't want to get out of bed aftereards, and I have to re read it and see all the obsesive stuff about brett wihich I am forgetting forutunately and unfortunatley. the way it isi I'm glad I don't have a boyfriend, bnot because I can run around a nd get play or do stuff with guys, but v\beecause it hink it would hadd another huge element of stresssand I really don't need that right now. I thought vivian is so gorgeous and her bf is not that cute. andni told bvern to say hi to jason for me, hut to just because I liked him and thought he was a nice guy but not because I was interested or flirting at all, or had been thin,king babout him. now the says she told him he shoul come to austin with reza, and that would be fun, but I'm thinking kind of weird too, and I don't reallywant to party with reza or old high school friends if I'm there only because of veronica and jason who lives in san antonio. I know I'll have a fun weekend because thats the only option up here, but I hope I get lots of sleep too. all done 
__label__label0 I can't make up my mind if I want to go to a meeting with PROPNAME or not. He asked me to go, but I kind of don't want to go. I have a math quiz in the morning and I need to go over the problems. Anyway. i haven't heard from PROPNAME in a while. I hate it when guys tell me that they are goingto call and they don't. PROPNAME was acting strange towards me at the ORGNAME meeting yesterday. O well, I hope he dosen't want a relationship with me. I cannot handle one right now. I don't understand why I always I have to speak to people before they speak to me. I know they see me coming. I'm not going to worry about that though. I wonder if I should participate in the Miss Black and Gold Pageant. I really don't see myself as the type of lady that enters those kinds of things. First of all, I don't have a talent. Second of all, I'm not good at answering questions right off the top of my head. I have four years until I can do it, so I might just wait. If Cookie does it, then I will. I'm kind of excited about going home on the 00th. It's the Homecoming Ceremonies that night. I'll get to see my recent ex-boyfriend. I can't believe that he still tells people that we are still going together. He has a lot of nerve. Anyway. it hasn't even been ten minutes and I'm already tired of typing. Psychology is confusing to me. So is Philosophy and Biology. I don't know what to believe in now. I was brought up as a Christian, but now I realize that science proves some things in the bible to be wrong. I still don't know what came first, the dinosaurs or man. Anyway, I'm not going to worry about that either. There are so many guys here that are attractive, but the bad part about it is that they know they are attractive. Guys around here seem to stereotype the freshman girls as "easy, silly and stuck-up". I have to admit, a lot of my classmates are stuck-up, but I don't think they are silly. Once again, I don't understand why I always have to be the one to speak to everyone first. It's mostly the girls who have to be spoken to. Soem of the guys are like that too. I like the college life so far. My parents used to never let me do anything. They were so strict on me. Now, I go out whenever I want to, but I'm not going cray with it. They thought that I would go wild when I got to college, but I haven't. I'm mature enough for college. My brother on the other hand wasn't. He went to college for a day and quit. He was so worried about getting money, that he quit scholl to get a job. He needs that job too because his ex-girlfriend is going to hit him up on child support. My paremts tried to warn him, but he was hard-headed. 
__label__label1 The first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. They are ages 0 and 0. I can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. They live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. I feel bad saying this, but it is true. She is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. When I used to live with her I took advantage of this. I made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and I did not take care of myself. Thank God I got out of that situation. I moved in with my father and my former stepmother. They got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them I would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. Even after my dad and stepmom got divorced I still lived with her, I am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. Getting back to my sisters, I am afraid that they will fall into the same habits I did and they are not as lucky as I was to have my stepmom. I can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. I hope that I can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because I only get to see them about once a month. They are beautiful children with great personalities. Unfortunately PROPNAME the 0 year old has already had troubles in school. I know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. Andrea the 0 year old is absolutely brilliant, I don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern I did of lying and not doing her school work. I would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because I am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. I cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. I know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and I love my mother very much also, but I just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. It would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. Overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that. 
__label__label0 As I sat here reading the assignment, half of me read the words while the other half of me sat concentrating on my sweaty palms that I only seconds ago was rubbing. My stomach is apparently telling me that I am hungry in its own noisy language. I just went to a 00th anniversary party for my grandparents last night. I got up to speak with the other grandkids. My cousin PROPNAME, who lost her mother (my aunt) about 00 years ago spoke before me about how incredibly remarkable they have been acting as her parental role models, support system, and financial suppliers. By the time the michrophone ( I do not know how to spell "mike" [I guess]) got to me. . well- I didn't get to speak. I woke up this morning thinking about what I wanted to say, and I decided that whenI finish this assignment, I will write them a note to write them what my tears prevented me from saying. That reminds me of another letter I need to write- a totally belated graduation present thank you letter. I don't feel like a complete jerk- I received the gift pretty late. I just took notice of my blistered feet. They took some serious heat from rush. My sister and I are now in the same sorority. Hopefully, that can be a tie that binds. We get along so well- when we're apart. It's kind of a shame that we lived together for so long (sometimes sharing a room) because we probably could have been the best of friends. 
__label__label0 I have too much to do today. I should go work out. I need to learn to prioritize. Its unbelievable I have met or at least introduced myself to since I hae lived here, I need to work at remembering names. I like my classes so far, all in their own way. Calculus is the weirdest because I don't remeber much at all clearly from high school yet I kinda like bein confused like that. I wonder how all of my friends are doing form high school?  I hear that the football team is using more of a passing game and I wish I was there for it all. I need to call my friend PROPNAME, I can't wait to go visit him at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I've been writing for fie minutes now, its going to be a while. I need to go get I computer, I am tred of always waiting in line or bumming other peoples'. I'm gettin pretty good at spinning the pen on my finger, its kinda embarrassing if I do it in class and I miss. I wonder if my dad is going to get the new car or not. I would loe the chance to drive it. I would race cars if I could but I would be entering the field kinda late and I don't even know where to start. I wish I hd the time and money to take driing lessons this summer, then I could at least go to driev on a track if I had the car. Theer are too many things I want to do when I grow up. I like to be able to do everything, but I also want to marry the perfect girl and have the best kids and spend all of my time with them. I'e been writing for ten minutes now, I'm getting closer. My hand is starting to get kinda tired, I have multiple thoughts at the same time and I can't keep up with them all at the same time for this paper. I need to do my laundry, htose sheets I hae are still kinda stiff. I wish I had'nt slept so late today, I wasted half of my day and I missed a class too, it was probably the only time the teacher has gien a pop quiz. I want more cool signs, I think my walls are so bare, I want to have a room I enjoy being in. I get kinda lonely here by myself sometimes, but I think I am glad that my roommate never showed up. It gies me a lot more freedom. I can't wait for this weekend, hopefully I can get enough peopel together to go cliff diing. That guy in the hall is gettin on my nerves, he worries too much about stuff, the prob is I kinda see the way I used to be in him, and wonder why I eer had friends. so far college is a blast though, I'e got all of my old friends that go here, plus all of the people that I have met, so I always have something to do, but thats the problem because sometimes I don't get stuff I should get done finished. It's kinda my fault too though, I think I kinda aoid doing homework and such. I want to go see a movie sometime, its been a while since I'e seen one in a theater, I need to find a cool girl to go with. I really don't have and good thoughts now, being interrupted is kind of a hassle. There are lots of people I need to call, I should do it soon, many people I enjoy spending time with and I havent seen in a while. I have two dictionaries up there that I havent even used, I feel kinda bad but I havent had any need for them yet, n/m, I am supposed to look up some words for that seminar class. Oh well, I'm finally done, but I htink this is kinda cool, it takes  a while to get into, but once I was started I think it was fun. 
__label__label1 um I have never done this before. I guess I will think about my day today. I  went shopping with  friend. We went to a little store called oat willies it is  kind of a "subculture" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all  kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs  too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then  as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin  robbins to say hi. I don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we  went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable  looking t-shirts. We both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there  accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really  had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the  rack that didn't have a shirt on it so I guess one of his shirts was missing and  I feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. Oh  well no big deal for me I guess. so I bought one t-shirt for three dollars and  we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another  little store that sells interesting odds and ends. Myfriend ended up buying a  bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap. then we went back to  her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room. ok  I think it has been about 00 minutes I hope whoever has to read th 
__label__label0 I'm now worrying about what to write which is really irrelavant because to the instructions. I am at a loss. When the mind watches itself most of it stands still. But when it stops being vigilant it wanders anywhere and everywhere past, and future. Again I can think of nothing when watching the mind think of something which is very ironic. And again it stops and doesn't go anywhere when I try to see where it is. I hope I don't bomb this paper which I'm not sure how its to be graded. I bet my grammer really sucks, if I can use that word "suck"  but I shouldn't worry about my grammar because it doesn't matter according to the instructions yet because of insecurities I still worry about my presentation, any presentation. Now I am talking to my friend and being distracted, but since I reallize it I'm no longer distracted. What else is going through this undeveloped mind of mine, wow, that rhymes, mind and mine, ok, I probably sound really stupid now but am just following instructions. The phone rings, and I think that it may be my mother checking up on me which she already did, but I'm sure would not hesitate to do it again. Room is now quiet with everybody gone, no distractions except for the unknown mind with all of its mysteries. Funny its always with us yet we know next to nothing about it which maybe this class will attempt to shed some light on but I doubt it will do very much good for anyone to decrease thier pains and increase their happiness. Everything in psych. is great but helps no one if it serves no purpose such as increasing the quality of ones life. Philosophy I believe tries to a bit more to do just that but is so abstract and too much of a subject to be studied than to be experienced and learned which doesn't help anyone anyways except to tickle and play with the intellect. Unless a certain form is adapted to the way of living and adopted as the way of thinking will it help those who really seek help. Now I'm a little afraid all that I just wrote is irrelevant to the assignment and will recieve a bad score. Perhaps another manifestation of insecurity. This world today is full of insecurities, fear, though we have everything anyone could want in the LOCNAME, but yet we lack that which cannot be externaly obtained. How ironic that most of us strive in life but never know what we are striving for, what PROPNAME PROPNAME calls personal management but lack of personal leadership, direction. Because we seem to have everything we want but are actually lacking we don't know where to direct our constant thirst for happiness and constant aversion of suffering. But the cause of our pains is ignorance, the lack of wisdom, wisdom - understanding but mostly realizing how things really are. Perhaps to this is to philisophical for the assignment. but as thoughts come into my head I write just like the instruction say. Although I can think of no reason for this assignment excpet to observe the mind, but I can not see anything to learn. yeah, maybe the next assignments are also like this, but probably not, wishful thinking. Almost done, just two more minutes and I maybe will continue the other assignments. Our study hall in our dorm really sucks. Its very creepy looking with all sorts of pipes and wires running through the wall. Uh, oh, girl thoughts, probably not appropriate, I don't even know if I spelled that word correctly. My mama told me that mastery over the mind is the highest form of victory anyone can have. It is said that a man may conquer a thousand people and a thousand lands, but it is far better to conquer himself just once. 
__label__label1 Alright, this is going to be pretty random, so whomever may be reading this should be pretty amused. Hmmm. . i had my audition for the "Madrigal Dinner" tonight. I think it went pretty well. I sang a song that I wrote. He seemed pretty impressed. I find out Monday morning if I made it or not. I think until then I am going to have a nervous tick thing happening. I broke up with my boyfriend this weekend. He is really stupid, "dumber than a box of hair" as I like to say. That sounds pretty mean, but he really is. He isn't going anywhere. He is a 0th year high school student. If you carry on a conversation with him that involves a word with more than 0 letters, he is lost. Unless it is about auto mechanics. Then he will talk your ear off. Or if it is about drugs, he can talk 000000 miles an hour on that subject. We were just too different. I'm not into drugs and stuff and I am 00 and already in college. He is a pot head (along with other things) and he's 00 and still in high school. He is going nowhere. He wrote me a really shitty letter today. It made me feel like crap. It was along the lines of "I am nothing. You are too good for me. I should have known that the second I got something good I would lose it. "  How am I supposed to respond to somthing like that?????  My friends said it was his feeble attempt to win me back. A very feeble attempt. I am not conned into taking someone back because they make me feel guilty for ruining their life. I feel really bad though, because his parents absolutely adored me. I was everything they wanted him to be. I am fairly intelligent, Christian, drug-free, etc. I feel kinda like I let them down. But I wasn't getting to him. I couldn't change him. It's not my fault right??  What could I do?  I can lead him to the right path, but I can't force him to change. I showed him what PROPNAME did for my life, did in my life, what influence God had over me. But he was so stuck on his paegan ways. He told me he was going to quit drugs for me, but he never did. I can't be with someone for the sole reason of trying to change them. I don't know. I miss my ex-boyfriend. Not the same guy. A different one. We went out for 0 years, then he slept with my best friend. On that ridiculously long survey that we had to do for this class, that "worst depression" stuff was caused by him. 0 years!!!  And then he just threw it all away. Gosh, I miss him terribly. Sometimes I still cry at night thinking about him. I have yet to find a love so strong like I had with him. Have you ever felt that?  That feeling like you know, I don't know exactly what you know. You just know something. That feeling deep inside. That feeling noone else can give you. I had that with him. We were even engaged. Engaged!!  He made me feel like I was something worth having. Well, until he screwed my EX best friend. Stupid whore!  I'm not bitter. Hehehe, anyway. I don't know. Sometimes he is all I can think of. I'll catch myself comparing other guys to him. Every other guy I have dated has been compared to him. Should I put a name to "him"?  His name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I always have this emptiness inside me. I didn't feel empty with him. It was like he made me complete. And when he left, he took a big part with him. I know that sounds trite, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. Just pure emptiness. I got so depressed after the "incident"  that I didn't have the will to do anything. Nothing. I just laid there in bed. I would be in a trance through school just to come home and lay there. didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, didn't sleep. I never slept, but I was never awake either. It was like I was one of those vegetable people who was purely living because of the machines they are hooked up to. There was this invisible machine keeping me alive, and that was it. I was just existing. That's the word I was looking for. Existing. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried to make it less. Have the scars to prove it. Nothing I'm proud of. I had just reached the lowest I have ever felt. I'm sure it will happen again. I'm only 00. I'm sure I will find another guy that will fill the void PROPNAME left, but then he will leave me too. So what's the use anyway?  Dating is just a vicious circle. Someone is bound to get hurt. If not you, then the other person. Unless of course you find that one person that doesn't have the urge to bang one of your friends. But shit, that even happens in marriages. You think you found that one person that won't screw you over, and what happens? They screw some younger, prettier girl. Gosh, I'm really bitter. When did I get this bitter??  Is it bitterness or cynicism?  I can never tell the difference. Maybe I'm a little (or a lot) of both. <Deep sigh>  One minute left. Okay, now I'm depressed. I was in a good mood after my audition. Then I get to thinking. Damn thinking. It never does me any good. I always seem to think about things that depress me. I think it is because all of my good memories are linked to painful ones. So I try to think of good ones, but it just takes a turn for the worse. Adios! 
__label__label1 Alright, today was a pretty boring day. I feel really unsatisfied with my classes because they do not stirr any special interest in me. I thought I would be excited about at least one of them but not yet. I guess I am just a little mentally tired. I was so happy to get back into the swing of things and try and find my friends. Acutally I think I expreienced a fake high because I miss LOCNAME a lot. I was there for the last half of the summer and made some amazing friends. I miss my boyfriend there too. I keep wondering if he is going to send me the ring he supposedly bought for me. Hopefully he will. I really want it. He told me he loves me, so I just hope he does not forget about me because I will never forget about him. he was so nice to me. All of my friends like him and besides the whole , he has two kids, thang everything is alright. I learned from him that no matter how serious skeletons in your closet might be, your heart wins overall. You cannot talk yourself out of loving someone. I guess I really cared for him more than I ever cared to admit to my roommate who thought I should of broken up with him. Too bad she ended up traveling around with some random guy around LOCNAME who she met before our language was over. Her guy has had at least 00 partners. If anything, she shouldn't of met her lover boy in LOCNAME, MX. As for the rest of my dating life which seems to be my main concern these days, it is hella-active, like PROPNAME would say. This weekend I met some awesome guys. I am waiting to hear back from them. I can still hardly believe that I gave my number to a cute waiter at LOCNAME. I must be crazy. I usually just date around. I would love to find just one special person. I also need to workout more. I have been partying too much. LOCNAME was one big one month long party. Now I need to get serious about studying and try to find some interest in my classes. Everything seems to be running in circles in my mind. I am constantly thinking about boys, classes, and my friends who I really need to call and catch up. I can hardly believe I haven't talked to my closest friends in a month. it really feels good to get back in touch with them even though it is only over the computer. I am soo tired. I wish I could just take a nap and wake up stress free. All of these issues running across my mind are really stressing me out. I constantly feel tense. I hope I do not end up with some horrible health problems like my dad's family. Today at work we had to take a personality test and I scored high in a section that appearred to be Stress. I do not know what the category was but it started with an S and I am starting to stress out about even that. My body hates the beginning of school because everything feels so out of wack! Man, I already need a vacation. I am too tense for a 00 year old going on 00. Surprisingly I am not so nervous about the begining of the year but I can feel the potential homework overload slowly stressing me out. I am scared about my classes and I really need to get motivated instead of nervous. Writing down my thoughts is starting to stress me out. I am going to be so happy when I can submit this and check my e-mail. Then I can hear about my crazy friends' lives and take a break from mine. boo I have to wash my hair too and that is such a chore too. I wish I had naturally straight hair and legs as built as my dad. Then I would have hardly anything to worry about. I feel like such a basket case because I hardly voice my inner thought to anyone and I can hardly stop. I guess I usually set mine aside in order to enjoy a small vacation from my life and enjoy hearing from others. I really want to talk to my friend PROPNAME tonight. She helps me forget about everything and just laugh out loud and be abnoxious without being self-conscience. My laugh is louder than the average laugh so people usually stare at me when I open my mouth and chuckle a little. I saw people looking at me tonight at dinner when I laughed. Oh well. They must be jealous, yeah right. I need to live a little. In LOCNAME I did everything I could ever dream of doing. I climbed a volcanoe, developed a love of horsebackriding, enjoyed my daring side, and much more. It sucks to have to slow down for school and dive into reading material I would rather use as a pillow. Oh well, my studying today will pay off tomorrow. Right? right. I need to take a nap. I did not get enough sleep last night and am drifting into lala land slowly. There is a fire alarm. I have to run. It just stopped, maybe not 
__label__label1 I don't know what exactly I am supposed to write about. and I think about how much time I spend trying to perfect everything in my classes, but when does that ever go through. I think that there is so much to do and I have no time to do it it. the stress keeps growing and growing. I am a bad typer so this won't be as long as it should be biut I don't really care I keep fixing my mistakes even thoigh I know I am not supposed to I thik that my hand will start to hurt really soon after so much typeing that I am going to inevitablly have to take a break soon but I ll just keep going psy seems to be an interesting courseso far and I am looking forward to listening to some of the lectures. thinking/ I don't know what else I am supposed to type about so I am going to write words that don't mean anything to me I miss my mom and my family and I miss my exboyfeind even though we had a bad breakup, I don't know if this is approriate for this assigninment or not but I sometimes I think that my thoughts go in weird directions and I think abnormal thoughts that people don't usually think about but then again I am just another teenager who is full of life and evenerygy anf I I someimtes wish that my teenage days were over and I could then setlle down and do something useful with myselfv but I love being young I wouldnt give this up for the world and to know that in a couple of years I am going to be off doing sothing that will whats the word I am looking for effect, thats it, the rest of my life and the way that I live and the people I will be freiends with and the people I will work for what exactly do I have to do to make things work out for me/ what exactly do I have to prove to people to show them that I deserve respect and a good life/ I think this typing is a waste of my time because I am not even getting anything done and I haVE so miuch reading to do and I have better things to do than to type this and no one is even going ot read this it angers me that I have to spnend 00 mins on something no one is even going to look at there are about 000 people in my class and I doiubt anyone will know who I am for a long time f even ever. I wish that I never sined up for this classs as a freshman. I wish I could go home and not be stuck in a place like this and I wish things could change for me. I don't know how I am supposed to think about the way I think. I think thats stupid no one understans fully how the brain works. no one will ever understand the way I work and I wish they would all stop trying. I live my life for everyone else iu thats wrong, but I can't ever live up to any expectauions and it upsets me. I will most likely grow up to become a psyco! thats all. I'm stopping now. PROPNAME PROPNAME 
__label__label0 I am so excited about being down at LOCNAME but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at LOCNAME. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to ORGNAME- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at ORGNAME ORGNAME is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and then I am going to study some Spanish and try to start reading Psychology. I am really mad that I am going to miss the first exam but thankfully I will be able to make it up. I am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. I almost wish I was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when I give it up. I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten to do and see since I have been Miss Teen of LOCNAME and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. I would like to run for President of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. I would love to be President of Pi Phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. I haven't gotten involved in anything at ORGNAME yet and I am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. My neck hurts today and I think it is from carrying my backpack all around. I had to take a bunch of my books back to the Co-op the other day so I got to lug the around. NOT FUN! LOCNAME is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. My sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to ORGNAME, but I love it at LOCNAME. I just really feel at home in LOCNAME and I enjoy the diversity of all the people. It really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. Coming from LOCNAME, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. Well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. I guess I will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading. 
__label__label1 Right now, I'm a little worried. I just stopped talking to my friend PROPNAME on the phone and he was talking about claiming credit and what not. I hope I'm not forgetting to do something or else I'll be in trouble. That's the last thing I need right now is trouble. My dad would kill me if I did something stupid (e. g. forgetting to do something I needed to do) and was disenrolled from any of my classes, especially ones in my major. I looked over some information I had, and I really don't think that there will be a problem, but I wish PROPNAME wouldn't have mentioned anything about it. I'd much rather be surprised than to know something was coming and have nothing to do about it. It would be like a giant meteor coming to destroy the world. I would make rather just die in a giant flash of light than have to worry for weeks knowing that there was nothing I could do to stop it from happening. In Deep Impact the president broadcasted to the world that there was an asteroid coming on a collision course with LOCNAME, I would hate that. Sure they are going to try to stop it, but I don't have that much faith in the LOCNAME Government to fix poverty let alone stop an asteroid from killing us all. Dig a giant hole in the ground. sure, that'll work. But anyway, I hope nothing bad happens to me. This whole college thing is a new experience for me, I'm not used to taking responsibility for everything like I have to now. I'm alone up here, except for my sister not that she can do anything. If I screw up it's my fault and I have to live with my mistake. And even if I do mess up, what would happen? I'd get dropped from a few classes and I'd have to wait another semester before doing the classes that I want to get done now. It might be good in a way, I'd have an incredibly easy semester and later I would have more electives in which I could take anything I want rather than having to take Chemistry or Psychology. All I can really do is hope, I guess. Other than the ocassional worrisome things, college is pretty nice. PROPNAME is an awesome dorm, much better than what I expected from a dorm. I think that I might like living here next year if I don't move off campus. I'd prefer living here actually. I never was very social before in High School, but it's nice here, it's different. Most people here aren't complete idiots. Honors dorm and all. Also people are maturing I think. There aren't as many clique-ish people here. People are more accepting of other people's views and lifestyles. It might just be that we're all in a daze from being thrown into the college and are just looking for something to hold on to, but it could be maturing. I hope it's maturing. Before in High School nobody would talk to me. I think I scared them. But here it's different. Here people don't seem to care. I think I have to give the whole "God you're so HOT lets be boyfriend girlfriend" thing a few more years, but I can live with just friends, for now. That's always bothered me though. How people, no matter how smart or mature they are, are obsessed with looks. Personally, I don't want my girlfriend/fiance/wife to be gorgeous by society's definition. I feel that every woman in one way or another is beautiful, as cheesy as that may sound. I've met people that I'd like to get to know better, and they aren't model types. I've seen those types too and they don't impress me much at all. But I think the real thing that's keeping me from getting to know any of the people I'd like to know better is my shyness. I'm not used to being social, so being thrown into a dorm with so many other social people is a strange change for me. It takes some getting used to. I need to adapt I guess, become more comfortable with my surroundings and my place in the surroundings. My friend PROPNAME became engaged too. That scares me. He's 00 I think, maybe 00, probably 00. Right now, I'm only 00 but I can not see myself getting engaged to be married in a year. 00 years, when the average lifespan of a person is over 00. That's 00 years, a long time to stay married. And if I do get married I never want to get a divorce. I'd rather spend another year making sure she's the one than finding out a year into our marriage when my wife might be with child or something else. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but I think that's the way it should be. But I can't tell Casey that. it's his life, I've seen him and PROPNAME together and they are a good couple, but people change you know. Maybe it's just my fear of the unknown or maybe it's true, but marriage ties you down, it keeps you from changing, it's binding. I'd hate to see Casey or PROPNAME's life ruined by this. Or at least I hope they don't get married until much later, and just stay engaged. Maybe I care too much and maybe it's none of my business, but this is just my stream of consciousness and it doesn't matter beyond my own mind. 
__label__label1 I really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. It annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. Just a few minutes ago I was trying to wash my towels and I couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. I felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. It's not like I would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but I feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. Well I built up the courage because I was annoyed and I then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. So I had a whole who-ha over nothing. Oh well. I actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. I love clean clothes that smell really good. I use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. I keep looking at the clock because I'm waiting for Road Rules to come on. They kicked this girl PROPNAME off last time because she has an alcohol problem. I really don't think it solved the problem at all. Now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. I guess I've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so I wouldn't know what it is like. Needless to say, PROPNAME is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. She firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. Don't they all say that? Well I hope she gets better because I know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. I think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. I know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. PROPNAME PROPNAME talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. She thinks it's a great thing. I think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. Although I am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, I think this is totally different. These kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. I think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. Ok-enough about that. I've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. I take mine in the morning and I'm in there for seriously about 0 or 0 minutes. Whereas she's in there for like 00 or so. I wonder why that is. I guess I'm in such a rush in the morning that I'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. There doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now but I guess essentially I'm doing that now. Maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'd rather focus on what's ahead tomorrow rather than the stressful day I had today, primarily in the computer lab. I've decided that I really don't like programming and the technical stuff of computers. I really don't care how it works as long as it does for me. I'll just have to put up with that class until Christmas to get my credit. I'd feel kind of sad if I was a professor and people only took my class because their academic advisor advised them too or if they just did it to fill their credits. I guess they're used to it and don't take it personally. Whatever. Ok- time's up now. I've been writing for 00 minutes as told. Bye. 
__label__label1 I don't like computers really,  they are kind of a pain in the arse, but things are getting better, you know,  people learning new things, new methods of compression and technology makes you stop and thinks when is a computer going to be too fast. . my parents are okay too I guess they just aren't in the "loop:" as one might say,  always having to show them how or bring them up to date and shite, but . . school's fun, math is not okay. PROPNAME PROPNAME is awesome I'd love to meet one day. lot's of people listen to her, why should I be the only one to get to meet her?  carl thinks he can play bass, but he can. why?  why does jimmy stink?  why do people love anime so much?  ani is a hottie. often in class I find my self fantizing about what is would be like to meet her. just hang out with her and stuff. be all buddy buddy, get a fone call everyonce and a while and just see hwo things are going down. making sure she okay, even tho she's married,  I don't' think it will last, she's too free and out will mr. difranco is never around always at home,  I think it's first love syndrome. oh well. PROPNAME is awesome,  she's soo cute and so funny, and just awesome in everyway, she's not that much younger than me either,  she's very smart, and did I mention cute?  wish I knew what exactly she thought of me,  wouldn't I be wierd if who if anyone ever is reading this comes up to me in class and starts commenting on what I wrote?  that would be too freaky, this college is kinda stupid. first of all I'm not 00 yet so they won't let me get the fancy shmancy email account yet the other day they let me get a 0000 dollar loan which I have to pay off in 0 months or they sue me . . wacky oif you ask me, but then again who is?  this campus is so huge no one knows anyone around here, none of the professors, none of the students,  you smile at someone and immediately your somesort of wack job walking down the street stoopid people keep bothering me, don't they know I'm trying to write?   bno respect I tell you, none from no body not my parents, not my stoopid facking roommate who thinks he's my father,  him and his girlfriend I tell yoiu, first of all they are not very pretty people to begin with and then they are always here having sex and dammit it get annoying,  always trying to include us. not leaving alone when I don't want to ber apart of the picture. always is it okay if I don't this or we're goint to have sex now don't oing tin to the bed room I don't' car ego and getr phreaky don't tell me about it. ican't ccare less,  I just bugs the hell out of me when they decide, "well jason is feeling left out of our circle of love lets include him"  and I don't want to have any thing to do with them and when they are togheter it's fucking discussing. they act like fuckingh middle schoolers. always hopping and bopping about acting all like "I love you" I love yout oo let's have babies. holding hands and licking lips . never a moments rest of it,  it's enought to make you want to grab the rifle and end it one way or another. dammit . and carl always talking about how big his phallus is. I mean it's okay every once and a while. like on vacation and stuff. but every five minutes?  him I can tolerate,  go figure. ben used to be cool now he's just a useless pain in the arse. PROPNAME is pretty cool, but he's always going on about how everyone's gay and they should be proud of it. I mean it okay but when he tries to convince mne that all I know is gay everytime I see him it gets fucking annoyimg,  maybe I get annoyed to easil, not really things don't tend to annoy me,  just stoopid peole. people who don't know when to stop being stoopidn and take stoff as their own and well start being just there. I wish scarlett was here sute she did some questionable things but she was really cool about evertyhing I can't fart but carl can like the dickens pikachu, polemon is funny , tell you when they ge to talking and stuff it can make your day,  everything just falls in to place and you think to your self you know at least my vocabulary issn't just my name that would proabably suck. just jas ja jja jaosn on on jaos jaoson jaosn would get too annoy anyone eventually. what about people named al tnow that would suck for them. a a a a a all al al llll l l al al dman now speech for them. ca ca ca ca rl rl carl car lr rl rl it's pika chu dalkt  and would about those foregin peole. to summ it all up  I hat my life 
__label__label1 I'm stressed out about my Calculus class I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish all the homework and be able to get an A in the class. I really want to make an A because that would increase my prospects at getting a good first job, of course that would only be good for a first job. I really don't like my job at ORGNAME it is really annoying, all people seem to be in a bad mood all the time and I don't find it that enjoyable. If I were somehow rewarded with more money I think it might be managable however, because I can't seem to get a raise out of them I'm going to look for another job. I hope my typing doesn't wake up my roomate my girlfriend is really distressed about our relationship I guess I'll have to write her an e-mail and make things better between us. How I would describe love right now, I've always thought that you had different degrees of love throughout your life, I would say that I love her however. i really hope my roommate is a deeper sleeper than I think he is because I know I would be annoyed if he were typing where I could hear it. Tommorrow I have to go get my Economics book in the morning and read part of that, college seems so stressful, I don't know if I'm going to be able to budget my time. The bookstores rip you off you pay all that money for books and then they buy them back cheaply and then sell them for the same price that you bought them for. That might be a good way to make some money buy opening a bookstore. My dad was telling me how having a low overhead would produce a lot of profits for something on the internet. I had better be quiet so my roomate doesn't hear me, but the noises in the hall are louder but not constent. He has too wake up at 0:00 in the morning to go to class. I don't know how well we are getting along, I guess he is an ok roommate but I wanted him to be a little more outgoing. I guess I'm going to have to meet people on my own which I'm not all that good at but I guess I'll have to try. I need to find out what my rights are in this room and if I'm able to type till just 00:00 or if I can type and make noise till one. I'm willing to try and make it as comfortable for him as I can because I want to fit in with him, but I don't know if I should draw any lines or not. I have all this homework and I don't know what to do about my time management. He just got up was it my fault or did he get up on his own, I don't want to intrude on his space but where does mine come in. I really like my computer it has everything I want it to have, but the company I ordered my graphics card for went out of business where am I going to get another graphics card. I wonder what else I'm going to have to do for homework, I hope it will be easy. I want to graduate early but can I do it or am I going to have to go all four years, if I graduate early I might have some money left for a car, I would really like a corvette but the insurance on them is so expensive especially until I'm 00. I don't know if I can handle doing all this stuff and do my homework as well, with my girlfriend and friends and still have time to work on the weekends time is suck a valuable asset. what else do I have to do. 
__label__label0 I am thinking of all the things I have to get done today and how I don't' have anything else to think about. there is so much to get done here and I only got behind one day. dang it this reminds me that I haven't gone to mezes to sign up for anything yet. so I better go get that done tomorrow. RTF reading. shakespeare reading. psych reading. bio reading. art history reading and journal. dang, I guess I could do some of it during dinner, but I told PROPNAME that I'd go with her. I woldn't want to be rude so I guess I'll do it all when I come back. mm, dinner. I'm hungry. wonder what we are having. it better be better than lunch. at least the salad bar was stocked up. I hate it when its not because that is one of the only safe options that there is. Mark comes up to see me on Saturday. I wonder if we'll ever get any alone time. I hope he gets here late because I'll need to sleep during the day because of my pledge retreat on Friday/sat morning. OH I need to call someone about a sleeping bag. shoulld write a note about that, would if I weren't typing all my thoughts out. this is weird. I've never had to do anything like this. wonder if 00 minutes is up, nope 0 minutes. I think a lot in 0 minutes. maybe that is why I talk so much. probably. anyway. I wonder what is on comedy central. I shouldn't turn the tb on because then I won't be thinking anything at all. I'll be all zombie. I'm feeling such frustration now because I really don't want to be doing this and I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I should have done this much earlier when I was feeling okay and had stuff to think about. now all I have to think about it complaining because I don't feel well, don't want to be doing this and I'm hungry and don't want to eat cafeteria food. hey I could order a pizza, but don't really want to spend my money. I should get a job. Wonder if I can fit 00 hrs of work into my schedule. lets see if I worked 0 hrs that's only 0 days of work. no I really don't want to do so much right now. I'll wait till next semester till I have a better idea on what I am doing and how to handle college life. plus I have meetings on 0 days of the week. maybe 0 if I do rha. but teachign dance again woudl be fun. I could contact them and just talk to them. yeah I think I'll do that tomorrow. plus it will keep me in shape. since I'm not taking any dance training right now. about 0 more minutes then I can go eat. I also need to get a haircut. I'll do that tomorrow too. oh and I need to get this printer working. maybe I'll wait till mark comes so I don't screw it up. yeah I think that's what I'll do. only about 0 more whole days till he gets here. I wonder if we are doing the right thing by staying together while at college. It feels right but it sure does hurt when we have to leave. And what is a healthy amount of time to see each other that we won't be intruding?  I don't want ot not see him but I want ot have a life of my own here and its hard to get involved when you are with your boyfriend all the time. maybe I'll drag him to that party on sat. I think he'll have fun. I should really ask first before I make plans. I'm rambling. I always ramble. kerri is done with her psych. I should start mine after I get done with this assignment and the other one. I really hope the other one is easier than this one. if my head wasn't so foggy maybe I wouldn't ramble so much. but then I ramble when I talk too so nevermind. my throat still hurts. I hope that goes away soon. it sucks to be sick when you have so much studying to do not to mention the other things I have to get doen. I should make me a list. I think I'll do that after I eat. k almost done  I hope I didn't make katrina mad when I didn't write back to her. I guess she'll have to just understand that I have way too much to do. oh well. I wonder when it'll get cold. I can't stand this hot weather and its so freezing it the room that I have to wear a long sleeved shirt. but then again maybe its just because I'm sick. wonder if kerri is also cold. oh the 00 minuts is up. food. 
__label__label1 stream of consciousness. we studied about that in junior english. what am I thinking. mowed the lawn. hot sun. sweating. boyfriend says I don't have enough time for him. parents say I spend too much time with him and goofing off . i haven't had time to do anything but work and go to school. i have to work today at 0:00 till close. this is fun I like this assignment. parents are eating lunch. they are always on my back about something or another it seems. they make me so mad . I can't wait to get out of here and get my own place and have my own rules, clean house when I want to and not when they tell me to. i love them but I need freedom. why won't they move my curfew up, why do I even have a curfew. I am 00 years old and I should be able to stay out later than 00:00. i love billy so much. it tears me up that we fight so much. walking on campus. gees yesterday was a bad day. every thing went wrong. i have to host three parties today at work. i wonder what packages they are. billy has my license. I need to get it back today. i wonder where they came up with that name. I wish I could be a famous singer. then I wouldn't have to work so hard at getting money and a decent job. I hate rita. what gives her the right to say that we have sucky cashiers. like she is any better herself. she can't keep employees and not many people like her. she is so rude. i wonder if it is true about her husband. that is sad that her stepson thinks she is his real mom. I can't believe they haven't told him yet . he is what almost about 00 or so. 0mins left. i wonder what our next poject in here is. it says on the syllabus. when I am done I will look. i hope it is fun and not borring and hard to understand like my mythology teacher and english assignments. time is almost up then I will call billy back and take a shower and go to work.    
__label__label1 Well, my first thought is that I don't quite understand this activity. I'm not sure if you want me to tell you my thoughts, as in a journal, or just irrevelant thoughts that pop into my head as I type, therefore I'll just write a journal entry. Well, right now I'm mad at my friend because she seems to be choosing her boyfriend over me to hang out with, so I guess that would make me jealous. And it doesn't help the fact that she and her boyfriend are the only two people at LOCNAME that I know. Another feeling that I'm experiencing is sadness and homesickness. I just talked to my best friend, who is attending the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and she was describing to me how much fun she is having and how many friends she is making-this makes me sad because I know that she is having more fun than I am. I think jealousy has a little to do with that also. I talk to my parents almost every day, and they describe their everyday life to me, and I feel left out almost, because I can't be there with them. I miss the normalcy of home. I miss waking up in the morning and knowing who my friends are, and what to expect in my classes. I know that things will change, I'm just really anxious for that to happen. Sometimes I doubt if I made the right decision by coming to ORGNAME. Would things be different if I were at ORGNAME with my best friend?  I know things would be better. I was always afraid that if I went to ORGNAME, my best friend would think that I was going there only because I couldn't make friends anywhere else. I only decided to come here to UT because they have an outstanding business department, and I plan to major in Management Information Systems(MIS). I'm a little overwhelmed right now because it seems like there is so much to do. In every single class so much is expected of you. It will just take a little time to get used to everything. I don't adapt well to change-I'm very much a habitual person. 
__label__label0 As for now, I feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. I had many things to accomplish once I started school here at The university of LOCNAME and I am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as I achive the goals I need to. for instance, today, I needed to petition credit of hours which I earned off of the ap testing which I took in highschool. I attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though I typed the correct web site, I could not actually claim my hours. Thus I actually went to the Measures and Evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, I was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card I purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening I finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now I am a  much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, I began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. I remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times I feel that I can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything I need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends I know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. I do the same thing. I care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother,  he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. I miss him a lot. actually I probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed I would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could I not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. I really miss them. in addition, I miss my friends which go to different schools. I keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. I am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. I'm very close to my mom and that is why I believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and I hope that whatever I choose to do with my life I can impress her. however I would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that I will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that I can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that I can. 
__label__label0 I've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. Tryint to plan everything out so I get to see everyone. I miss home. The people, the places. My church, my room, and all the little things too. Just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. So peaceful. So safe. One things I've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. It won't ever be tha same. The relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, Ms. PROPNAME, my parents. You can't replace that. It's always there, just sitting, empty. Sure, I can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. They're all differnt and unique. My left arm is tired. Well, I just thought that so I figured I'd write it. And I just thought about writing about my arm. Wow!  And I JUST thought about thinking about writing about my arm. It never ends. weird. I've always been interested in how the human minds works. It's funny when you think about it. Here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work!  Isn't that weird?  When you think about it, where do you get yourself?  How can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with?  It's impossible. An endless cirlce of thought and ideas. The human mind is a mystery, and always will be. That kind of impresses me that I came with that. Gee, I'm smart. Just kidding. Well. ten more minutes. Ok, I ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. My shoulder hurts. Wow, I complain a lot. I'm feeling my elbow right now. It's swollen or something. I'm not sure why. I've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. Who knows?  It doesn't hurt, but I don't know if I should avoid straining it or what. I'm supposed to work out today. We'll see. I've been thinking about someone back home a lot. Her name is PROPNAME and we met about a month before I left for college. There was this kind of initial attraction I guess you'd say. Kind of weird. I haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. I think it was her bright personality. She has thing kind of glow about her. She's always laughing. I like that in people, because I need to laugh more sometime. So we kind of talked about our relationship some, and I told her I didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, I mean, since I was leaving for college. She's a junior in high school. But we've kept in touch a lot. I think she wants a committment, but I don't think that's smart. But you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. Sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. It's like faith. God doesn't always make sense to me. I hear all the time people trying to disprove God, or Christ, or the Bible, or christianity. like I'm taking this class, the Rise of Christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the Bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. But the fact is this:  I know what PROPNAME has done in my life, and nothing can change that. EVER!  What He did WAS illogical, it WAS beyond understanding, it WAS a miracle!  And NOTHING can disprove that, not science, not anything. How do people react to that then?  Well, people's final defense is usually, "Well, then you must be crazy. "  And if that's all they have, then I'll take that any day. Times up. Hey, I liked this assignment. I think I will enjoy this class. 
__label__label0 My first reaction to this assignment was to just write that I felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 00 minutes; however, I am interested in where this is going. Right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how I can touch-type and he cannot. The other day, we went to go and buy fish. We drove around LOCNAME I don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. We drove to LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME, ORGNAME, and LOCNAME. I finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. It really upset me that out of the 0 fish that I bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment I previously had. The sole fish that I possessed in that tank ate all of the food I would drop into the tank continuously. It really began to bother me when I saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. So, I took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. I understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. I knew that I was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. Well, I finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so I eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. I am really suprised that I did this because I am such a humanitarian. For example, whenever my other fish would die, I would get other people to remove them from the tank because I couldn't deal with the dead fish. I always felt as though they were looking at me. There is one instance where I did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. I don't know, I think I have always had such a problem with death. It scares me, but it doesn't. For example, I used to work at a hospital in LOCNAME LOCNAME, when I was a junior in high school. This is where I had my first real encounter with death. I never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. However, since then I have had to deal with it several times. I guess I take that back, I have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. I can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. Anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. And I know this sounds corney, but every single time I have had to deal with death since then, I have seen a little yellow butterfly. This spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 0 or 0 occasions. Well, my 00 minutes is up.

__label__label1 Throughout my life I have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future. for example, when first arriving at ORGNAME I was awe-inspired by the size of the campus, and the enormous amounts of students which attended. I was shocked by the different races which represented each other. I could tell that everyone was already forming their own little "clicks", whether it was based on their interests in music, race, sex, sexual orientation, everyone was already making new friends, and social gathering were taking place. While everyone was socializing I was busy worrying about the classes that I was taking, the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that I had. I was lonely, I was scared, and being from a large city, I was trying to adapt to an even larger one. although LOCNAME is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things, for example, the opposite sex,new friends, and just having a good time, while at the same time, studying. I knew coming to ORGNAME that I would have a good education, but I needed a way to find myself, who I was, and what I wanted to study, I came to LOCNAME wanting to be a doctor, but I figured that it may not be something I wanted to do. perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy, at some time in my college education, but whatever it is that I may become I want it to be something that I am going to be happy doing. I realized that high school is much different that college. college is much more demanding, and time consuming. but in the end it will even out someday. When I was a child I had dreams of being a great military leader. a policeman. a astronaut. or a physicist. as of now I don't know what I want to become I'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly. as a child I always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why I wanted to become a doctor. but now that I'm in psychology I've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind. but how it works and functions. in science I have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others. for example in psychology, it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression. or just find a way to make everyone happy, in the event that I would someday accomplish something like this, I would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle. knowing that I have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day. now that I am more relaxed here at UT it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster. finding the shortcuts. and finding which classes are the best. all the time when I first discovered what comes along with a great education. i have also figured out that I can become whatever I want to be. just as long as I put my mind to it. and test out my skills as a academian. coming to UT I knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me. i knew that with hard work and determination. i could accomplish whatever I wanted to. conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine. overpowering myself, knowing that I can't always tell myself what to do all the time. and just let my unconscious mind take over. often times when I become depressed I find that it is easier to listen to soothing music. talking with a friend. or playing chess with a friend. or playing cards with them. at times I just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily. when I do find myself depressed I always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind. and think about other things. such as playing basketball. playing baseball. or like I said playing a good game of chess with my friends. i havent quite yet found my niche at UT but it will come someday. and I too will find my interests in academics. and find something that I truly love doing. whether it be my major now. such as biology or even psychology. as a kid I remember pouring through my fathers materials. because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments. and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature. all along I thought I always knew what I wanted to do when I got older but I guess its an answer I will learn in time. ??? 
__label__label0 thinking about how school is so different, so many people, so many things to do, all the perpetual motion. music is great, is it really what I want ot do?

__label__label0 I think this is a really cool writing assignment. I like assignments that are easy yet mean something. I really hate this song I don't know why I am listening to it but I am too lazy to go change the station. and this new keyboard  is hard to type on it forces me to typer 'properly' I guess thats not abad thing. I like it when my roomate is not there sometimes and I am here alone I like being alone. I am currently having a brain blank. I am full because  I just ate lunch with my friends and now the bottom of this hard wook chair is pressing into my ankle bone and is killing me. ouch. I don't understand why my room is so cold good lord ihave to wear long sleeves to stay warm. I am very tired and I should sleep but I need to do this assignement which I have sadly put off already too lonf. haveing an 0am math clas sis not fun and I hate it. but the material is easy so far. I am bored and tired and I feel like going home but I can't my roomate is going home and I will be here alone all weekend. well we are rarely alone becase all of my freinds come to our dumb room all the time which sometime is annoying because we don't get stuff done soemtimes. this new song is itersting. I love music. I am sleepy. but man the lyrics are so dumb. what is the deal with all this insipid lyrics. I don't know what else to wreite. I think amybe my mind is slow because I just ate and I'm sleepy and I can't think very clearly. there really isn't much to think about. I am happy that my friend is coming to visit us here he lives off campus and we don't get to see him too often. but hes really cool. I feel happy to be able to see him. I feel comfortable with him. I really like my room. this commercial is really dumb I wonder if they even make impressions on anyone. I feel bad for putting this assginment off for so long. I don't usually do this I often wonder if  I will pull the 0. 0 I need this semester I hope I do. I think I am overall happy here in austin but I get lonely someimee even tho I am surrounded by my friends. but they are my high school friends. writing for 00 minutes about nothing in particular is harder than it sound si guess. I can't think of anything to write. my mind is blank. all I am thinking baout is typing. which I am not doing very well. I miss my parents! woah what a comment but I think I do. which is cool I guess but it has ony been like 0 weeks I don't know what to think I wonder what football game is next (ORGNAME) I think we are playing the redskins soon. I think tis radio station is terrible. my roomate souild be be back in like 00 mih\nutes. man I dotn have anything to say. I think I maybe should have  done this assignemnet at a later tome when my brain isn't sleepy and my stomach isn't full from lunch. my floor is really dusty. gross. I have 0 minutes left. write weite write. I can't write anything. i am mentally singing the lyrics to this song and that is the only thing in my mind. I am going to try to go to the libraby tomm and study. I have parties to go to tonite and sat nite and an honors 'party' on sunday so I have to try to get as much done on sat. I feel like I am behind. college is hard as to where u will get behind and then wham it all sneaks up on u and u don't even realize it. but I love it so far and I can t imagine living this life for 0 years. thats a long time and I can see why people love these 0 years so much they are so random and fun. I can already tell that I am going to miss it during the summer and when I leave. I have 0 minutes left. I like having my own computer here I brought it over labor day weekend and I set it up, boucht the cables, etc all by myself which I have never doen before but I did it and its a cool sense of accomplishemnt. and I catually got the wthernet working even tho I had heard horror stories about it not working. its so fast. I like being self sufficient I thik its really good. I liked setting it up and makin it work myself. and it aint no I-Mac either where u just plug that mess in. oops times up. 
__label__label1 I hope that it doesn't matter that I do not capitalize anything. I seem to type better and more "stream of conscious"-like when I don't have to worry about anything. I like it here at ut. I like how my classes are big. I thought that it was going to be a really big change for me. I went to private school all of my life until right now. my classes were no bigger than 00 people. in fact my psychology class is almost bigger than my entire high school. the hardest part for me so far has been homesickness. I really do like it here. but this whole independence thing is new to me. this week has been a ton better than last week was. I am a little worried about tomorrow because I have two quizzes - one in chemistry and one in medical terminology. they shouldn't be too hard because I've been studying all week. first tests are always worrisome I think. I am going back home to san antonio tomorrow. I can't wait to see my dad. he has been in la for a week or so and I haven't seen him or talked to him. when I think of my dad I always think of this past summer because we would always watch the atlanta braves games and espn baseball tonight together. I have always been a big baseball fan. I never wanted to play softball or baseball, I just really like to watch it. I have realized that watching baseball with my dad at night was how we bonded. he is not a big talker. he is not a very sensitive person either. throughout my life I have never really had anything in common with my father until baseball. I guess the biggest thing has also been me coming to ut. he came here and graduated from law school over 00 years ago. he was so proud that I decided to come here. I love to see him happy. my boyfriend is still in san antonio. he doesn't admit that he didn't want for me to like it here. but I know him better than he knows himself. we've been dating for over three years now. it doesn't seem like that long. I love him. he has tried everything to make me feel better, concerning homesickness that is. he calls me every night and tells me how his day was and then asks me about mine. he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. it's kind of scary though. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. but I am only 00 years old. how do I know for sure that he is the one?  I guess it is just another mystery of life. last week when I went back home I went out with my boyfriend on friday night. I didn't think that it was going to affect my mom so much. she was so hurt that I wanted to go out with him and not spend my time with her. it's hard though. being torn between your boyfriend and your family. but I spend all day saturday and sunday with my family. my mom apologized to me about how she acted. I told her that it was hard for me to choose and that I felt torn between the two. she understood and now everything is great. communication is the key to improving and understanding all relationships. that is what I think anyways. well my twenty minutes are up. I have to go meet my roommate and then we are going to go eat. until the next writing assignment. 
__label__label1 I suppose that the first sensation that comes to mind is contentment because PROPNAME PROPNAME is playing on the radio. I love PROPNAME PROPNAME. A lot of times I tell people that I'm obsessed with her music, but I really don't think that is true. I exaggerate too much, I think. I guess I just want people to be impressed with what I'm saying. I don't care if they like it or not - I don't care if they like me or not. In fact, in a lot of ways, I would rather them not like me. I know that is completely abnormal. MOst people strive for acceptance or whatever. I would rather people not like me. That is, except for the few friends I have. I have about ten friends, I would say. This is fine with me. I would rather have ten friends that I know and trust than have a hundred that I barely know. I hate the concept of accquaintances. I realize that sometimes it is necessary, but it just seems plain stupid to me to call people who are really accquaintances, friends. A friend is sacred. Family is important and all. They are the people who are stuck with you no matter what, bascially. A true friend chooses to be stuck with you for the rest of time. That is sacred. Without my ten friends, I would be lost. If they decided that they didn't like me, I wouldn't know what to do. However, people I don't know - I could care less. I don't like meeting new people. I guess maybe that's because I am uncomfortable with change. New people change so many things. I realize the value in making new friends - I really do. but, I think its better to meet someone as it happens - by chance, so to speak. Consciously making an effort to go out and meet people - I think that undermines the meaning and value of friendship. If someone said to me - I'm going to go out and meet friends today, I wouldn't even know what to say. WHAT?  That is beyond the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I can only shake my head and wonder what goes on inside that person. That statement makes it sound so easy - just go out and meet friends. How simple. I feel bitter right now. I don't think I should feel bitter. It feels wrong, somehow, so now I feel guilty. I'm bitter because it has always been a strugle for me to meet people that I like that like me back. Or so I always thought. In actuality, it was always in my mind. And now that I realize that a lot of people would like me if I gave them the chance to, that scares me. Like I said, I like having only ten friends. It works for me. I can't take on having many  more friends - I would strecth myself to thin. So, one would say, just keep some close friends and the others not so close. I do that now, to some extent, with my ten friends. If I did it with more - some would become accquaintances. Like I said, I hate the concept of accquaitances. And so, it all becomes a circle. Most things are circles, though. If you can't come to a conclusion, it is probably a circle. Circles are so hard because one is constantly doubting his/herself. Should I be on this side or the other?  I suppose that one just has to make a choice, a commitment, and stick to it. Faith - such a hard thing. Especially when one has to have faith in oneself. It's so much harder that it sounds. Perhaps it is the thing that humans strive for or should strive for. I don't know. I won't even go into anything like that. The meaning of life, etc. I don't know enough for that - not even close. That's okay, I can wait. 
__label__label1 I feel a little tired. It is cold in here. Maybe I'm tired because its cold in here. Why a writing this paper?  Am I going to be judged on what kind of person  I am by these rambling thoughts that I type down. I'm still mad that I lost my remote control to my reciever on the move up here. It will probably cost around  00 dollars to get a new one. You know I found it impossible to clear your mind of all thought, because to be able to do this you have to be thinking to remind yourself your not supposed to be thinking. Dad's birthday is this weekend. Probably going to go see him. I wonder how the new restraunt is doing. I wonder how PROPNAME likes running it. I'm getting kind of hungry. To bad there is nothing to eat though. Man I need some money. Maybe I'll get a job working on my days off so that I can have enough money to eat. I still need to read chapter 0 in my psychology book. Its a pretty cool book I like the qoutes by the different people. This computer is under 0. 0 tons I would say. Man I need to get out of the house. All I do everyday go to class come home eat study watch tv go to sleep. And then the next day get up clean the place up eat study watch tv study shower well I guess I shower the day before two and then go to sleep. LOCNAME is very different. I had 00 people in my senior class and everybody was extremly friendly. Here everbody is different. Maybe they weren't raised the same as me to be polite to everybody. That alright. I'm sure I'll find some friends that have the same views as me. Whats the deal with all my classes talking about how depressed you are supposed to get. Its kinda like they are telling you that if you don't become depressed then you arent normal. Maybe I will, just to be like everyone else. Nah. Maybe I should start lifting weights again or swim. Man this is weird. I keep thinking in the back of my head that this is supposed to be stream of concious but for some reason I keep trying to make sense on way I saying. Damn that really scared me the dang air conditioner just made a helluva loud noise. That reminds me of the questionare that I had to fill out for the experimental research for this class. Are you afraid of spiders do you constantly look for spiders do you dream of spiders thats crazy. Hey that reminds me of Saturday Night Live. Thats Crazy. That pretty funny. Mispelled thats. Oh well. One minute left tick tock tick tock  tick tock oh no time has stopped 0:00 AM that is what it says why is it when you notice time it goes by so much slower ding ding 0:00 our time here is done. 
__label__label1 At this very moment I am feeling slightly depressed. My roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. That's great. The first weekend of school and she decides to go home. She left me all alone even for the first football game. It's not that I am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. It gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. I'm also a little stressed. Moving to college has been fine for me. I haven't gotten home sick, really. And I'm having a lot of fun. But adjusting to how much work I have now is hard. I one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. That's impossible here. And if your not computer literate your screwd. So that means that I am screwed. But on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. I have no option if I want to succeed. Succeeding is important. I was valedictorian of my high school. I think that is a curse. It seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. And it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. I want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. I hope it happens. I really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. He is 00 and lives in LOCNAME. What a bummer. Not that he is 00 but that he lives in LOCNAME. It is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. Most of the time I don't know how to read him. What is he thinking?  That worries me most of the time. I don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. We once got into a fight and he told me that I had become to dependent on him. That really pissed me off. I don't believe that I had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. Bored because he had moved and I had nothing else going on at the time. How dare he call me dependent. How am I suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to LOCNAME and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. Dependent my ass!  It just really irritates me. But I don't know what to think about it. Moments like these, when I'm all alone is when I miss him the most. And I try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time I can't help it. then I have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. Its him that has the problem. Why does he have to be so independent?  I don't believe that someone can be totally independent. Everyone from one time to another needs someone. Everyone. So why does he have to act as if he doesn't. I wonder if my time is up yet. I honestly don't think that this has helped me much. Its just made me think more. Great. yes my time is up. good. 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling very annoyed. I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a ORGNAME gift form the Co Op I can't believe that PROPNAME is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 0 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the "jerk" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the ORGNAME ORGNAME and then found out that he was going to LOCNAME I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 0 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 00 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 0-0 times a week and running 0-0 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like PROPNAME PROPNAME. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   
__label__label0 OK so right about now I'm thinking about what a great and interesting assignment this is . I am also thinking about all the stuff covered during the last classs about the brain I can actually see my brain working, with all that left and right functioning stuff. My thoughts are now drifting a bit becasue the phone just rang but it was for my roomate. Now I'm thinking about this one girl I sat next the last couple of classes we were usually arow or two apart but man I really thinkshe is  beautiful. I hope to sit right next to her this upcoming class and start up a conversation or something. I hope she likes me, I'm nervous as all hell. Ok now I'm thinking about all the stuff I have to do today. After this assignment ill probably ask someone to do my laundry, then ill do some english and chem and of course the dreadful calculus. My sensations are somewhat jumbled I feel kinda depressed just because I have been looking for a girlfriend for so long and can't find the right one. I feel like I have so much love to give but noone to give it to. Also I really miss my friends from home in LOCNAME antonio. there are about three girls I have my eye on right about now. this one girl I went to camp texas with whose name is PROPNAME, that girl from psychology class, and this girl I have been in love with for about a year( but she is in LOCNAME LOCNAME and has a boyfriend) ,  I usually think about her every hour of th eday and dream about her like four days out of the week. Yeah I reallly miss PROPNAME a lot. sometimes I see myself kicking that boyfirens ass but then I think about how upset it would make PROPNAME. Almost everything I do is to show her that I am better thatn that loser of hers. Iv'e never met anyone remotely similar to PROPNAME, one of a kind. Oh well I got to stop thinking about it or ill end up in tears again. anyways I really can't wait till September 00 because this band that is from my home town in san LOCNAME LOCNAME is finally putting out a CD and it comes out that day. This band(Sublime) is actually old but the lead singer died in 00 of an overdose and the band members finally got over the death and decided they ow it to him to keep playing,  there motto was long live the Sublime sound. there sound is like a mix of a lot of Reagae, punk, hip hop, and some spanish stuff in there to. So since they were going to need a knwe lead singer, they got a long time friend of the band , PROPNAME PROPNAME, a tatoo artist from Southern CALI, to sing. There new name is "Long Beach Dub ALL Atars"  I could go on and on about hte history of this band and what is goung on but it would get crazy and who ever reads this would think in crazy, good thing noone is going to read it. That would kinda be crapy if anyone read this becasue they would be like reading my mind or something. I just found out I have three minutes left and I wish I could stihere and do this all day for real m like in a zone or somrething. right now I'm stumped I don't think me mind is moving at all, I'm ust thinking about hitting the right key. I feel like typing out the lyrics to the song Badfish right now becasue they are about love afor a girl and for the beach and ocean and the su, and big reefs underwater, god and all these things that ust hit me hard.    
__label__label0 Well, college is turning out to be quite an adventure, although I could have guessed that before I got here. I am enjoying meeting different kinds of people as well as being challenged in all of my classes. I could probably do with less reading assignments, but the majority of the text that I've been reading holds the same principal. Learn to question things and make a decision on your own, with ideas to support it. I like this concept, it allows several possibilities in every aspect of life. The idea that the classroom wants me to think critically is exciting. My first impression when I walked into a big lecture class was intimidating. I'm used to the small classrooms where I know the other students around me and I'm comfortable with them. I can also get bored with them as well, so the big classrooms allow me to meet different people every day, this is something I definately like. I like to think that there are a lot of other college freshman feeling the same feelings that I am feeling, that I'm not the only one that is scared and intimdated yet excited all at once. It makes me feel not so alone, in s ORGNAME as large as this one it becomes a necessity to not feel alone or isolated by your fears. Making new friends is difficult but I think that the majority of freshman on campus are open to forming new friendships with many different people. The entire aspect of not living with my parents and having them in the same house as me p=monitoring my decisions and actions is both liberating and terrifying. I feel as though I have a chance to completly be myself and decide if the person I have been for the past eighteen years is truly me, but at the same time, I wonder if I can meet my parents expectations of greatness. Will I be the type of person that they would be proud of, will I have the ideas and beliefs that are acceptable to them. My fear of not meeting their expectations is not completely overwhelming because they have always taught me to question things and I think that if I form my own beliefs that happen to differ from their beliefs, they will be accepting if and only if I have reached that conclusion through logic and reasoning and I can support my ideas with valid argumentation. It definately can become intimidating at times though. I think the main thing that scares me is having to support myself. I have lived with these people who have taken care of me for eighteen years, I haven't ever had to support myself. In a world that I've only been shown glimpses of, I will soon be expected to make my way through on my own. THis I think is the truly scary part of starting college. It shows us what the world is like in spoonfuls and hopefully, we are prepared enough to face it by the time that we leave college. I don't want to be naive and think too optimistically because it is hard to look at the world in optimism all the time. Yet I don't want to scare myself to death thinking negatively all the time either. COllege will be a good tester of my character and ability to survive without my parents holding safety nets for my constantly. Over all, I am excited and terrified all at once. 
__label__label0 why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and I to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 0 years, and all of a sudden I have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, I don't think so. I mean, it is a nice gesture, I guess. I would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, I hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. I eamn, I did come here to expand my horizons. I do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. So, I decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. Why? it isn't like I am enjoying this. I would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. I really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. But, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and I love that. Even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. She is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, I could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. It was almost as though I could read her mind. My foot itches. Tomroow, I am going to church for the first time in about 0 months. I don't know why I stopped going, maybe I got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. I am not really sure, but I am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because I definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. No, that is not the right word, I am not lonely, maybe just scared of what I am to become being spiritually dark. Why did that happen? I don't understand so many things, but I am trying. I have also been going with PROPNAME, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. I really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. I miss my mom. I hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. He is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. He isn't very attentive, but very creative. I miss my family, we were very close. Except for my dad, he is a jerk. I wonder sometimes if I will ever find it important to speak to him again. I don't really think so. He does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. He doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every BAD move, without noticing the good ones. I am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but I am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. Maybe it will come in time. I hope that I am not studying the wrong things for class. I often wonder how I am going to make the grades. I mean, I know I can, I am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. Especially coming to college for the first time. I never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. Once again, I am so glad to have PROPNAME here to keep me in my comfort zone. It is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but I am struggling with all of these new people. I have not found the time to REALLY get to know anyone that is new yet. It is like they are all aquaintences. I am sure that that will all change, once I am in the swing of things and I do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. Why are we doing this assignment? Am I part of some sort of research? I would like to know, I feel like I am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. Maybe I am just another research rat. Why do they always do research on rats? I don't get it? If you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? I mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. But I do not like that animal research idea at all. Give it up. We are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. We should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. Why should we impose onto other species? What if it was the other way around? Wouldn't we think. "Why do they even care? It isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?" People are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. It almost ruins the whole experience of life on LOCNAME. or mars for that matter. Do we care if there is life on LOCNAME? Unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? Technology is killing man, man is killing himself. Life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y0k crap. Oh well, I don't understand. Why am I thinking all of this at one time? Pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as I am typing, but I suppose I am thinking it for a reason. I got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. Why? I asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. I mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. I think I deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, I am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. I miss the punk rock scene in houston. I am sure I just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. I found a club that I am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. I am extremely excited about that. I wonder if I am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. I wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. Then, all of the thoughts will explode and I will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? I definately think so. Well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. I want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. I can type extremely fast for some weird reason. I am done. enjoy me *cara* 
__label__label1 stream of consciousness, I don't even know how to spell the word, god my roommate is so retarded. she is so fat. if I get fat because of all the junk food ill be real angry. god I can't type. this is so retarded. I really like the song. damn I have to go to the bath room and its only been like 0 minutes porbaqbly less, there I dammit go again, can't type. uggghhh the stupid computer guy didnt call back about my computer, stupid flirt  oh yeah he can flirt and try and act all cool with me and my roommate but can't even get my computer back before my assignment is due. I hate using other peoples computers it just doenst feel the same and I really don't like typing on lap tops. I like my computer, it feel comfortable, I feel so weird at my own personal computer in college doing college stuff. although I am reall glad I don't have to write any papers. I'm pretty damn good at writting but I hate the effort that you have to put into it. my papers have to be perfect, each word percisely chosen, but then that is the point of most papers I mean all the really good writters specifically choose they're words to convey a point. I really have to go to the bathroom, but my god damn roommate has a guy over and the bathroom is right next to her room, I mean how akward is that. I have a problem going when its just girls. I have a dg meeting no a retreat at five 00 can't wait I really am beginnig to like being a dg although I don't know where ill get the money to pay for this but I worry about that later, I always get around things that I want, although I didnt get into the sor that I wanted I mean out of 0 I didn't get either, I just didnt realize how incredibly hard is is to get into the good ones, I just wish I knew why I was rejected at some of them. and I am really really bothered by the fact that this is so final I mean for life, I can't go back and try to fix things or change things. that's what's really bothering me, I can't seem to be in charge. I really wanted to be on crew really bad, I looks so fun and I love water, but the practices are so early I mean 0 and 0 in the morning, that's like the middle of the night for me. I got home at 0 and would have only got 0 hours of sleep if I wanted to go to try outs, and since I can't go to the practice tomarrow I am pretty sure thqat I can't do it, there's always next year, I guess its all for the best, I mean I will have a chance to get my footing and get adjusted, I don't want to be to heavily involved my first semester and being in a sorority takes up so much of my time. god I just really want to meet some hot guy and make really close friends, I know I'm supposed to give it time but I have been so severly disappointed since I have been here. I didnt get the chance I wanted to be in the in the really cool top sors and live-- had to go to the bathroom much better. I guess I'm happy I mean I just have such high expectations for myself, ilways want to appear to very cool to everyone else, I guess other's opinions really do matter and I know that isn't what is going to make me happy yes like with jas. jazz I really fucked up that one, all I could think was will I be cooll with this guy next year, not if I was happy or if I liked him as a person and when I realized what he meant to me it was too late. and then there's also the fact that after we got in that little fight I cuouldnt do anything about it. just wait for him to call or not call, I couldnt fix it. even after I went down there I wanted to make him see I was sorry and that I could be and was everything he wanted. I can get so messed up sometimes. I don't give people a chance because I don't perceive them as what other's would perceive as cool soes that make sense well to me it does. why am I so obsessed with society standards, I guess that 's I why I have never really be that happy or had a really super good best friend. to worried about what other people will think or say when they see me. I want to be proud like all the other girls and I don't see why they get to have everything. I mean they can be cold hearted bitches an dback stabbers, everything bad, but they'll have popularity, hot guys tons of people dying to be their friends, but me typically very nive and loyal doesn't ever get any of that, or maybe I do but just not they way I want. I always want what other people have or I can't get. more writting but I kkinda ran out of topics running why do I have to run so much and eat so little I'm mean I have a serious problem with wieght gain, I can't loose the pounds and I seriously feel like cruying because my legs are so thick. I mean I work out and I'm trying to more and have seriously cut back on my this song sucks how much longer, I guess its ok I don't want to take off my ursuline ring its part of who I am, I think its cute that I still wear it. i had a good time at ursuline it was only this summer that I got dicked over. I don't know what the deal is with andrea but the has some serious issues, she needs to grow up or get a life. I mean she just takes me for granted so much and now she's doing it to my roommate and I don't like it, I thought for once I would be able to get heroutof my life but it doesn't look that way, its like she doenst respect my friendship at all, she really doenst respect anyone, she is a conceited spoiled brat. I need to brush my teeth oh hey look I'm done  
__label__label1 I am thinking right now, at this momest what PROPNAME is thinking. does he like me??  I wonder. I wonder if I am too short. I wonder if I am too fat. I wonder if my mom is Ok. she is always worrying about me and she thinks so highly of me. I don't want to let her down. My dad works so hard for the entire family. I sometimes think he looks so sad. I hope he isn't sad because o love him more than anything. I wonder if I will find true love?  Someone just like my father. A strong, hardwroking, Loving man who would do anything for his wife and kids. I am very annoyed right now at the sound of the vaccum. I feel sorry for the woman who is vaccuming. I hope she can not read this as she is standing behind me. I am very excited about the party tonight. I hope I can balance work play. I think I will be able to. I have never had a problem before. All the girls here are very nice. I was really scared to come here because I thought all girls that went here were snobs. But they are nice. I have matured greatly since I have been here. I can't believe I have a cclass at 0:00. That is such a nightmare. I would rather just get them all over with at once. I hope I picked the right sorority. I am glad I am not in Kappa with PROPNAME. but then I wonder if I should be a Kappa. I think I just look more like a kappa then a theta. Oh well. I will be happy. Our pledge class is awesome. I am so excited about this scrapbbok we have to  make. It is so fun. I love being like a martha stewart. Is it bad that I just want to go to school to find a husband and j\have my 0 kids????  I hope I really don't have to work. It scares me. Everything was perfect before I left. now everything scares me because I am facing reality. I am living with a person I don't even know - to go to school here. I hope the future brings awesome things for me. I am worried because everyone says that there is a time in your life that will be grief. I have had the best life so far. I am scared that one day it will just hit m - poof - and I will just want to die. I hope my mom or my dad or my brothers don't die soon. I love them too much. I never show them that I do though. I probably have the worst relationship with my motehr, ever. we barely speak. I just go to her if I want money. I think that that is because she sees me as the most perfect creation, ever. so she never has yelled at me, or scolded me. but she yells at my brothers all the time. That is so unfair to them. I should not be treated better. My brothers are all dyslexic, including me, but that is not my e\excuse. It is my brothers excuse for everthing. My mom is always doing PROPNAME's papers or assignments for him. That is so wrong. I work hard and study more because I am dyslexic. I deal with it. My brothers see it as a means to get out of doing work. The assume they are dumb, so they don't even try. they are satisfied with being dumb. That should not be the case. I really miss PROPNAME. she is my very best friend. I also miss PROPNAME. my two best friends at tech. I think it is great how I did not follow them. I am a very dependent person, yet independent. I depend on my friends, yet I love to be alone to ponder and be by myself. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are like my securities. Evn if I did notr have one friend here, I knew they, at leats bridget, will alwyas be there for me. I hope tonigth is fun. I feel really sorry for my suitemate. She tries so hard to meet boys but they just don't like her. She has had sex a lot. I am very pround of my virginity. I think it says a lot abput who I am and how important God and my morals are. I love the fact that I can just talk to God anytime - anywhere by myself. He knows all about me - and I know all about Him yet I have never seen him nor spoken to him. A true person is found in the dark. If you were to turn off all the lights everyone would probably like a totally different person they who they think they should like. It wouldn't matter is you were tall, small, fat, ugly, black or white, if the light were off. Only the insides of people would matter. Appearances say a lot aboiut people, but yet they don't. If a person was ugly, you probably wouldn't really care what they thought. Because we are all attrcated to people. Our frieds are people we think are attractive and so we only like people in which we think there is something pretty about them. well, my twenty minutes are up so I guess I have nothing more to say. 
__label__label0 This is my first actual assignment ORGNAME college so far. I've gotten all the homework assignments and practice problems, but this is the first one thORGNAME really counts. At least it is the first assignment that I know of that really counts. Of course, I'm not exactly sure what the professor is looking for, but I'm doing my best. I'm just hoping I'll get a good grade for this. So far, I'm having a lot of fun here in the lovely ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. It's a lot of work, but then again, I know it will pay off in the long run. And despite the small forest I've killed so far making flash cards for Spanish and Medical Terminology, its actually kind of fun. I like being busy, and I like doing things that lead to something bigger. In this case, it will hopefully lead to medical school. But that's enough about school, after all, I only live on campus, I'm surrounded by it! I'm in a great mood today and I have no idea why. I'm really hyper, and I didn't really do anything that unusual. I didn't eat an entire bag of Pixy Stix or anything. I did go swimming today, not nearly as much as I used to, but apparently it was enough to actually get some endorphins (if that's right) pumping. Now all I need to do is keep up that routine. I'm wide awake, and ready to go, even it is eight o'clock in the evening, and I have about a dozen other things I should really get around to doing. At least I'm organized though. I didn't really think that would pay off that much in school at least not right away, but it is. I can't wait until my birthday; I'll finally be eighteen! Its kind of funny how much a birthday can mean. Even though it's not that big of a deal, it's still exciting. Although the only thing I can do is go to clubs and join the military, and neither of those are exactly my kind of thing. It'll be nice to have people stopping and being completely amazed that a seventeen year old is actually in college. Will wonders never cease? Oh well, its all fun and games and it means presents! Shallow, but its nice to get things. Especially when you're one of those people who usually manages to remember everyone's birthday, even if it is a few days or weeks late. What matters is that I remember! I just like doing things like that, it makes everyone feel special, as pathetic as that sounds. I feel like this is the most incoherent thing I've ever written. I'm just rambling all over the place, but I hope this is what the professor is looking for. If this is stream of consciousness, I'm amazed anyone can actually read this kind of thing. It would drive me crazy to have to read all this rambling. As completely crazy and illogical as what I have written is, its nice to just be able to switch subjects like mad. It's a nice change from the whole introduction, body, and conclusion type of paper. Still, this style of writing is very refreshing and it's a lot more challenging than I thought. I've never really sat down and tried to follow my thoughts for twenty minutes. I guess I just don't have that much to think about, judging from what I have written. And it's sad because I've actually written a fair amount of absolutely nothing. Who would have guessed I could spend twenty whole minutes just writing this kind of thing? 
__label__label1 I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some PROPNAME. I hope she helps PROPNAME pay for that car she wants. But PROPNAME also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad PROPNAME is getting that car, ORGNAME's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 000 days, he was very proud and said that "a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. " I was happy about that. I just wish that my dad was as proud, and understanding of how hard this is, and what a real accomplishment this is. 
__label__label0 Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like ORGNAME so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in LOCNAME for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to LOCNAME, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase "Is it hot enough for ya?" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 0 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 00's up! Hope it was good reading!  
__label__label0 I'm so excited that my computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing today. Its really cool that I can watch movies through this sucker. Are you just supposed to write about whatever? This is pretty cool. I wanted to roller blade and some piece of crap girl told me I couldn't because some cop told her she'd get a $00 ticket, and plus it was raining, so that sucks. I am so ready to go out. I'm getting tired of sitting in my room all the time. I wonder what PROPNAME thinks about me. Does he still want to get back together with his exgirlfriend that sucks. If he does then he's stupid because I'm probably way cooler than her, and she's only a junior in high school. That's ridiculous. Boy's are so stupid sometimes. I can't believe the things they do. I want to play hockey. I miss playing hockey with my neighbors. Maybe I'll find somewhere to roller blade, and I'll be able to play hockey. That'd be good. PROPNAME wanted me to teach her how to play anyway so that would work out well since she's an RA. She'd probably know of a place around here that is good to skate on. Man, I wish my hair would grow out. It looks so dumb since its too short to get into a good pony tail and I don't feel like fixing it most of the time. I want to get purple streaks put in it. That would be pretty interesting. What if I got my eyebrow or my lip pierced? I bet that'd be weird. Just to look at yourself in the mirror with that would be different, plus my mom wouldn't freak out or anything. I hope radio shack gets that 0foot cord in soon, so I can get this TV thing working better and get some of these stupid cords out of my way. I'm glad PROPNAME traded cable connectors with me, so I could move the TV across the room. He wasn't using the length of it anyway. I really wish my mom hadn't sold my ORGNAME, Mario 0 sure would be fun right about now. I wish I was funnier. I can't ever say anything funny. I only laugh at other people or at myself when I do something stupid or klutzy. That was so funny when PROPNAME ran into that pole. I still can't get over that. He's a weird guy, but he sure is cute. At least PROPNAME is finally being half nice to me. That's different. I still can't believe he sat by me in sociology today. That's so weird. PROPNAME is my friend and he never sits by me. Butt hole. I need to read for that class. I'm glad I only have one 0 o'clock class on Fridays, so I can sleep late. I hate getting up early. It sucks bad. Ultimate Frisbee would be so fun on Saturday. PROPNAME is lucky to get to be in rowing. I want to join something. I halfway miss track, but not quite. It really sucks with Coach PROPNAME yelling at you all the time. I don't know what the crap this thing is. Stupid cat. ORGNAME ORGNAME always tries to rip you off. That was weird when I got in that fight with the lady at the hotel in LOCNAME. She was so bitchy. I can't believe she thought we would steal the nasty bedspread from their skanky hotel. I want PROPNAME and PROPNAME to come visit me. I miss them. Dorks still in high school. Oh, well. I hope PROPNAME is liking cheerleading more than she did her freshman year. I don't want her to go to LOCNAME next year. She needs to come her. That would be cool, but then I wouldn't be able to have any fun because I'd be afraid that she would get mad at me. I know I shouldn't care what PROPNAME thinks since we only met like three weeks ago, but that boy is driving me crazy. He's so hard to read. I need to get in touch with PROPNAME and see what is up with her new baby brother or sister and find out what PROPNAME's address in LOCNAME is. For someone who liked me so much, he should have told me when he was leaving or something. What a spaz monkey! I wish I could get in touch with PROPNAME. Eww. I need to call PROPNAME. He's a weirdo. I need to see what concerts are coming up. He always knows all that crazy crap. That guy matt is pretty cool. I should email him or something. I need to go visit PROPNAME. He's in a fraternity. Frats are so weird. They only seem to talk about their brothers and crap. PROPNAME is getting on my nerves somewhat. I know I shouldn't let the little stuff bother me, but when I'm with her all the time, its insane. Why can't she breathe with her mouth shut when she's sleeping. She needs to blow her nose or something. Anyway. This is a good song. I want to hear that Incubus song. That's awesome. 
__label__label0 What am I thinking? Well, I'm sitting in my dorm room alone right now. It's quite relaxing actually. My roommate has been rushing all week and finally decided what sorority she will join yesterday. She joined LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. When I returned to my humble abode last night I found our room decorated by her sorority sisters. The room looked really nice except for the balloons that made it cumbersome to walk. My roommate is nice. I didn't know her before we came here. It has been a good experience getting to know her and living with someone. I have never lived with anyone in such close quarters before. I think it's good for a person. It makes you realize just how many things you do that you don't even think about. I have to be so conscious of all the things I do so as not to disturb my roommate. That's enough talk about my roommate. I am thoroughly enjoying my freshman year at college so far. I am taking 00 hours and my classes actually seem to be interesting. I think it's amazing how much you grow up and change without even realizing it. Looking back over my life I have seem myself change. I think for the better. I have always been a lifeguard during the summer to get some extra cash. Last summer I managed a pool at a country club. I never thought I would be able to have anyone respect my authority and me. My lifeguards did what I told them too and the summer turned out great. I saw how I had to mature to be the leader where I had always been the follower previously. I just think it's amazing how you go through experiences and change because of them. That is what I am hoping to get out of college; an experience that will forever change me. I am dating a sophomore here at the university. We have been dating for a little over a year. I was extremely excited about coming to college this year because of the time we will share. Last year we had to do the whole longdistance relationship thing. It was really hard and expensive between trips and phone cards. His parents also do not allow him to date in college because of academic reasons. He is not a bad student, but they want him to have zero distractions. I don't know how they can honestly think that he will have zero distractions at college, but who am I to argue? All last year that left us with the task of hiding our relationship. We both really, really like what we have together and are nowhere near wanting to give it up. We made the commitment to work through this. It is much easier now that we are at the university because his parents can't watch over him all the time. He just left my room. We were watching my roommate's television. He is a baseball freak so we were watching baseball highlights. It was relaxing at the least. Over all I had a good first day at college. The only thing that didn't go smoothly was finding my first class. It was in building LLB, the hardest building to find on campus. I did eventually find it after asking about 00 different people. Our class was locked outside for about ten minutes though. The teacher didn't have a key. We did get in to our room after a few short minutes. I am quite amazed that I could write this much in just barely 00 minutes. I would maybe be inclined to write more, but I am extremely tired and I have to get up for my next set of classes tomorrow. I know this sounds like kissing up, but I am truly interested in this class. I hope I learn many interesting things. 
__label__label1 I feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. I find that it gets so monotonous when I see the same person day in and day out. I don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so I guess I am very wary of commitment, although I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. I miss the physical contact of a relationship. Maybe I haven't been getting enough hugs lately. I haven't had one for about a week now. It does make a difference. You have to fend for yourself here at LOCNAME. No one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. I have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that I deem worthwhile. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I am gradually learning how to handle it. I have never realized before how incredibly independent I am. I am in fact, lonely a lot more than I thought I was. At home I didn't feel it as much because I lived with four other people. But now, I notice that I get timid when I am alone. I didn't have a roommate for 0 weeks, and I thought I would like it because I would get privacy and free reign over the room. But I didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. I started eating a lot to fill the void. I never could figure out why I binged so much before, especially during high school. But now I think that I felt alone, and I was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. So I would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. That's weird how I wanted to be even more alone when I felt isolated. Now I want to get involved with people as much as possible since I have recognized the problem. PROPNAME and I will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. I want to have my meals with at least one other person. It sucks to be alone, but at least I know that now. I have ten minutes to write. Working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. It's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and I will be eating something for lunch soon. I don't want to eat alone! Maybe PROPNAME will eat w/me. I wonder what PROPNAME's up to now. He had an 0:00 class this morningI think? We spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. I like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. He's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. I don't know if I would want to start something with him. It would be a fun thing and add some "extra" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and I would not want to lose his friendship. I will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. I just want to be able to spend some time with him! I know I will though. There is that Navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and I think I should go. I don't want to know what I look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. Will I feel pressured a lot about GodI just don't know if I'm on the right track. I read that the best way to get closer to God is to Spend time with Him. I so don't do that. I think about God about once or twice a day. I've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of God working in us, or something. I try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. I just want to be me. God I know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. If I just let go a little, I can go a long way with YOU. But my gosh it's hard to let go. Let me see the ways I can let go. I'm going to go get something to eat for lunch. 
__label__label1 My mind is fried from the test that I just took. Did I do well? Did I screw up?. Did I get tickets to the football game. PROPNAME was supposed to have a friend draw. I hope our seats are good, because today has been a rough day. I hope PROPNAME likes me. This writing assignment makes me feel really funny because of all my sporadic thoughts. I wonder if this is one of the papers you decide to read, or if it is just going to end up in some data bank somewhere. I hope psychology is going to be a semi easy course because college at this point is a little overwhelming. My roommate just walked in, so I guess I should mention her. PROPNAME or Ally, whatever I feel like calling her at the time. She fun, makes me laugh, I could use that right now. The test was easy but what if I just screwed up on it because it was my first test. I guess I will know by today what the event will be. The pressure to make good grades is getting to me. I want to have fun and do a little bit of everything, but I don't know how to fit it all in. I want to party with my friends, but I also want to do well. How far will that get me in life. What if I bust my butt and nothing happens. I'm beginning to notice a pattern in my thoughts; they are all questions. Does that mean I'm missing the answers, or does that mean I worry too much. Here I go with the questioning again. I'm trying not to be clichéd and do the average, I wonder if so and so likes me, but it is ending up like that. All of my life is in a state of not knowing. For everything that I have learned, it seems like there is much more because everything that I know doesn't answer all of my questions. That's where I get my nosiness, I guess. I classify myself as an ambulance chaser. The time is flying a lot faster than I thought. PROPNAME PROPNAME is on tv, that is PROPNAME's favorite show. She's at home in LOCNAME. I miss her so much and that reminds me that PROPNAME's surgery is going to be tomorrow. He's so little, will he be ok. More questions. They are driving me nuts (feel sorry for the reader). Here's the issue of time again. I'm running out of it, literally and figuratively. I guess its nap time, I don't even know if I want to do that for sure.

__label__label0 I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 00 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 0 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. 
__label__label1 Man I wish I could go home, I really miss PROPNAME I know he is right down stairs but I wish he would come over. I can't wait until my sister comes today, we will have so much fun, oh I need to do my homework for math, and I can't forget to go to that meeting at 0:00. That reminds me of what I have to find out about it the subject I want to do. I wish PROPNAME would wake up I can't believe she was out until 0:00 last night, that is really late, but I guess since she didn't have any classes it is not that big of a deal. I want to eat lunch, I'm really hungry, I need to pack to, I can't believe I have to pack to go down the street, that is so stupid, I need to call my mom and tell her to get nicci to bring that shoulder bag. For next weekend. I'm tired. I wish I were asleep like PROPNAME. I wonder what our homework for linguistics is? I guess I need to look. This is a really weird thing to do, I wonder if I am doing it right, and what they will find out about me. I wonder if I am crazy, I don't think so though. I miss my mommy! I wish I was going home instead of staying here, but I guess that is ok. PROPNAME is so stupid sometimes. I need to not forget my stuff in the dryer. I wish blaire and PROPNAME didn't fight all the time, I mean I love them both, but they are so annoying when they argue. Oh yeah, I need to figure out where ORGNAME's is so we don't get lost, I guess I can look on the Internet. I love Family Feud, and playing it online, but it is hard, cause I always am talking to people and when I am trying to play that stinks. I'm glad PROPNAME and PROPNAME are my friends, and I'm glad I'm in the fig, it was such a good idea. But I wish I didn't have to take English over again. I wish I could just be in the fig and have just Math and Psychology. I am so tired, I can't believe I had to get up for one class today, I should have just slept in, it is all cloudy and everything any way, why should I get up when it is so dreary outside. Math is so easy; I don't have to go there to understand it. I could just get the homework assignment and I wouldn't need to listen to her talk. Man this is really hard to think of things to write I feel like my mind isn't thinking. I wonder how much longer my stuff in the dryer has. I don't like having to write everything I think, oh yeah I need to call and see how many minutes my phone has on it, so I don't go over. That is a lot of money if I go over my time. I need to look up the phone number to find out how many I have. I wonder whom I call, the place I bought the phone or ORGNAME, I don't know. I am thinking about thinking, I can't think any more. This is so weird. I wonder what lee is doing. I wonder if I am disturbing PROPNAME's sleep, oh well she disturbs mine when I am trying to sleep all the time. Man, I really am hungry now; I wish my 00 minutes would hurry up and get over with. I guess I am thinking about doing something else besides this. I am tired of typing. 00 minutes feels like along time when you type continuously. I wish I could think about something else. I can think about sleep, it is good. My bed is too hard though. I need to talk to my mom about that mattress store. I wonder if what PROPNAME said was true? I mean that is crazy if that really happened. I need to go to the store. I need to order nicci's bday cake. Man I'm cold. That fan is really powerful. I wish lee would hurry up and pack so that we could go eat, I'm hungry, but I don't know what to eat, the cafeteria always stinks and the place down stairs is so stinking expensive. I wish that the deli thing would open it will be so good. I wonder what kind of bread they will have. My contacts are drying out from this fan, but luckily I don't have much time left to write. Thank goodness. I hate typing all my thoughts for so long the time seems forever away. I wonder if I am using to many dining dollars, I need to go look and see. I need to pay my thing too. My face itches. Ok it's better. I guess my time is almost up! YEAH! I'm hungry I think I'm almost finished. I need to hurry up and eat though, because I have to get my clothes out of the dryer, so no one steals them. Ok, I'm finished. I need to spell check it now. Bye 
__label__label1 there is so much to do in my life. I am really really stress out about school. family. friends and boys I don't know why. but the past two guys that I've dated just suddenly doesn't like me anymore I really really wonder every time I think about it. maybe my personality. or maybe my physical attraction and all the want is one thing. and that is what I wouldn't give up well. there is so much to do in school. I have so much homework everyday and I don't know I hate precal. and I have homework in that class all the time and now I have to worry about the precal test on Monday. and dietary analysis do on Friday. and nutrition and psychology test on Monday after that oh my gosh I guess the professors just like to torture us by having due dates and test all in the same day and I have a tennis tryout on Monday. that means I have to skip my psychology class and my tasp thing. gosh. and I don't know why. but I just can't pass tasp I know that English is my second language but I've written so many paper. and I do ok on them but I just don't understand why I can't pass writing part on the tasp this is crazy. and since this is the first semester in ut I haven't got an apartment and so my parents is making me living with our family friends and I really really don't enjoy being with them so. I really really don't want to stay there either. I don't even mind to drive everyday back and forth so why do they care. if the gas money is what they are worry about. I'll go work and earn my gas money and I really really need to study. but you know you have to study in a place to you like but. I guess they just don't understand and also my dad always say. why do you come home anyway. because you are never home. but I am always home you know he is always at work. so he can't say anything but if he just ask my sister than everything is different oh well. my life is going downhill right now. but I guess I can handle it I just wish that I can be a little bit more smarter because. I study but I just don't know why sometimes I still can't get it but oh well and I just got a new car but I just don't want to drive back and forth because that would be too much miles I don't know why I worry so much about my miles either gosh. I really really hate staying in LOCNAME I want to come home but I don't know why they won't let me is not like they have to drive me back and forth I am the one who have to drive oh well life sucks right now but it's all good I can handle this situation but. hmm. school is kicking my butt and I don't have any friends there yet. am I just a loser I really didn't think like that before but I guess I am. am I really not likable because I thought I was before but everything changed when I decide to come to ut. and ut is so big. I thought that I would make friends really really easily. but I guess not. I really really hope that I would do good in school. and hope to find a nice guy and hope that everything will go where they need to go I really really hate my life right now and I am so tired all the time but I guess is because I am not getting enough to sleep. and now. I have to work out really hard because I don't play tennis anymore so I feel so fat all the time but oh well I guess I just have to work harder now  
__label__label0 Right now I am feeling good because today is Friday. So far I have really enjoyed my first week of school. I like all my classes so far, and I am embracing the whole college experience. I am also happy because I am going home to LOCNAME today. It has only been a week since I left but I already miss my house and especially my parents. Right actually I do not have anything on my mind. I am pretty tired because I slept late last night and had a fairly early class. In fact, right now sleep would be really good. Well my stomach is also talking to me so I am also hungry. I have not eaten yet today. I am actually eating less in college since I seem to be always busy and always on the run. I like it though because maybe then I can lose some weight. Another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. I never was really into computers in high school and now in college I have to constantly use it. I wish I was better with computers because I really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. I think the reason why I do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. I cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what I really want. For example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason I could not get into the website. However, I am glad I am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. I think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that I am rambling and to be honest I do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. I am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. My brain is just telling me to think of something to write. Actually I am also anticipating for the time to be up. Twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. Speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. I am finally done. 
__label__label1 I don't really want to go to my BA000 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call PROPNAME so we can go study at the ORGNAME or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 0000 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if PROPNAME has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at ORGNAME has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA000 I will go to eat at PROPNAME and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. PROPNAME should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for PROPNAME, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA000 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. 
__label__label0 Start 00:00 I should be eating right now, the hypo campus must be acting up. But this is due manana so better keep it going, a lot of thoughts flash through my mind, but only a few really become selected and sorted out, odd, what tells the brain which are important Music is cool, it's my life I live for it, random yeah maybe it's not so much a stream as it is jumping around, could you fail if your thoughts don't follow a pattern, that be kind of funny. I'm in the computer lab in PROPNAME and I wonder if the clackity clack of the keyboard is starting to get on people's nerves. Why did I pick the keyboard with the loudest keys, oh well can't stop now, There are layers of thought purple dragons just popped into my head when I tried to clear my mind and let the next new fresh thought come in why there are purple dragons lurking in my sub consciousness? I'm not sure maybe it has something to do with the little dragon on my amp, I named him puff, he sits up their and guards the amp, this is sad just looked up and realized how little I've typed, even though it's been constant typing, I had a thought when I was typing that but it got lost when I was typing it, no just remembered, it's that thought are so heavily influenced by environment. and yet they aren't, so many times your thought return to a constant theme that is prominent in your life, for me mainly my music, some other more personal things too, but they are usually shorter term. so many people walk in and out of this lab, probably not the best place to write this but who cares yay, PROPNAME concert in LOCNAME dome October 0th, Thursday, hmm let's see today is also Thursday I get off at 0:00, it starts at 0:00, sweet, won't have to skip class to go, good thing to cause the class I'd have to skip would be a fish seminar with like 00 people in it and attendance is mandatory. Got to get more people for the geology study group, I just told that girl I was starting one so I could meet her, so I better get one together quick, probably shouldn't tell you that but hey, it's one of the blessings of confidentiality right, ok started at 00:00 it's now lets see (glances at watch) 00:00, six more minutes hmm goes pretty quickly I should do this more, actually I do this just in a different form, Writing lyrics so that they tell a story and yet still rhyme but aren't in a meter but are musical is cool, think third eye blind the last tracks on the first cd, I can actually just get pages and pages of lyrical content that's singable by writing shorthand and tracking emotions pretty nifty stuff, I haven't slipped into that mode in this twenty minutes yet, usually it's when I feeling something or am just pondering something like why something is what it is, mmm want food ok 0 more minutes, whoa the person next to me is a really friggin fast typist the real way to do this would be just to write for 00 minutes down on paper shorthand, you can actually record the thoughts better, how boring can it be to read all of these, actually I wouldn't mind reading a couple, just see what people think and stuff, but I wouldn't want to do 000 of them, yucky. ulp, my time is up, wonder what the next writing assignment is, oh well got to go eat. 00:00 
__label__label0 I am writing an assignment for psychology. Stream of consciousness. What am I thinking right now? What am I thinking for the next twenty minutes? PROPNAME is watching the television. Wresting. ORGNAME. Idiots in spandex. T. V. is slowly killing us off. The announcer's scream. Loud, emotional, fake. Why do people watch it? Reality is more fun when it's fake. Big brother. Survivor. The real world. I hate the real world. True strangers, picked to live in a house, and devour each other alive. Devour. I want some ice cream, but I'm not hungry. They had Mexican food for supper tonight. There was a band playing. A Mexican band. I didn't like it. Music. ORGNAME's new cd comes out October 0. Hell yeah! Kid A is the name of it. If I could be in any band it would be ORGNAME. The television is distracting me. Wrestlers coming to the ring from the future. Futuristic wrestlers, live on television. And some people still believe it. PROPNAME just changed the channel. ORGNAME now. PROPNAME PROPNAME, and his Total Request Live. I'm ashamed of my generation. I feel sorry for PROPNAME PROPNAME, N'Sync, and all the other pop groups that greedy business men package to be sold. In five years where will they be? The kids who love them now will laugh at them, and call them queers, has beens. Telephone is ringing. PROPNAME answered it. It's for him. He rarely gets a phone call. I get all the calls. The end of my twenty minutes is coming up. Fifteen seconds, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
__label__label0 Well, hello Mr. Paper. I am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. Where should I start. "Start", isn't that a funny word. About as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. Well, this might be pretty long because I type pretty fast. My eyes are so tired. Sometimes I think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that I need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. Sometimes when I take deep breathes it hurts. "Why?" you ask. Well it is a long story. It doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( I won't get into it). So, I am a college student now. What does that exactly mean? I think it means I can finally be myself. I don't have to worry about what my parents will think. There is only one restriction still holding my true self down. My girlfriend that I still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. She lives all the way over in LOCNAME, and I can't stand the way things are. I say that I am in love with her, but is that true when I am so happy to be away from her? Anyways, I say "restriction" because that is what she is right now. I literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything I do. So I guess in a way I didn't get away from my parents. She took their place. So, I figure that as long as she is in LOCNAME, and completely attached to me, I have to have my fun here and then lie to her. I know it sounds bad, but if I were to tell her what I actually do here, I would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. OK, I am sick of talking about this. The women at this University are the most amazing I have ever seen. And I guess that is why I am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. I have never seen so many good looking women. I feel like I am in a candy store. And it helps that I am a good looking guy, because I get their attention. That sounds conceited, but I am an honest man. I know that some women are attracted to me, and I am attracted to many women. Also, I am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. I just tell here all the girls are ugly. I brought a camera to school. I have some incriminating photos on that thing. I need to get those developed and locked away. Nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. You see, why does everything come back to her. I hate it. I don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! But what do I do? I respect and love her too much to hurt her. So, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. Yet another thing I should be having to do. I just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and NOT worry about a relationship. Seriously, I have to get off this. Let's change the subject. I want to talk about cheese. Cheese is really weird. It comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. I know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. And then where do the holes come from? Are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? Swiss is my favorite. American is horrible. It just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. Cheddar is enjoyable. There are no other cheeses as far as I am concerned. They go great on hamburgers. With lettuce and mayo and ketchup, I can have myself a meal. Well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so I will end it here. It was wonderful to type on this lovely screen! 
__label__label1 The past two weeks have been extremely stressful. There has been so much going on, it has been hard for me to keep up with school work. I have not found much time for me to go out and relax. Although, I believe that the stress I have encountered is being relieved. As the school year progresses I think I will be able to juggle school, work and my friends. I have been getting a lot sleep. Even though I get plenty of sleep I still wake up in the mornings feeling tired and worn out. I don't know why, but I think I might be because I have been getting too much sleep! I think that is one of the main reasons I haven't been keeping up with my school work. This might also be the reason why I am stressed out. I have been so busy trying to catch up with the reading in philosophy. I went through provisional so I did not really get a summer vacation. So I want to slack off, but I know I cant. I do believe as time progresses I will be less stressed. 
__label__label1 So, I'm sitting here staring at the computer screen. I wonder what I'm supposed to write about. Thousands of ideas enter my mind, but one completely stands out. My roommate is again in a fight with her boyfriend. How can one person have so much anger trapped up inside of them? How can one person be so hurt and so hurtful to or from another. I know that I sometimes get in fights with my boyfriend. But they are nothing like this. I just don't really understand her sometimes. She complains that they don't talk enough, but when they are on the phone  they have absolutely nothing to talk about. What else is new, all she does is sit around in the room waiting for him to call all of the time. I go to class, come back, and there she sits still. I just can't do that. I mean, I'm dedicated and love my boyfriend, but not to the point of putting my own happiness and life on the line for one person. I don't think that I'm selfish, I feel like I have my priorities straighter. Except I happen to be the one without the degree plan that everyone else already has set up. I don't know what I want to do with the rest of my life. There are so many opportunities out there, how do you know deadon what you would like to be? My interests change daytoday. One day I want to do this, then the next day it's this other thing. The only sure thing and deadmindset thing that I'm involved with is my boyfriend. We've been together for a long time, and I've never felt as strong about anyone as I feel about him. We make all these plans for our future together that I hope come true. But they are only things that I want right now. I would love to marry this guy, I've been settled down for over a year now, and I'm happy this way. We both adjusted our lives for each other. I just wish the time was here. But I can't help to think of that continuous thought in the back of my head, of what if. I am extremely superstitious. I believe that there is a reason why we met each other, and every event that has happened since, has. But maybe I don't always get what I want because I'm supposed to meet someone else while he is not around. I have never been happier in my life, and I am always afraid of change. This move down here to college shuck me up enough. Now things are finally getting settled and I'm meeting tons of people, but I don't know whether or not I should dedicate my time to what I am giving it to. I make time for everyone, but not always for everyone. I keep a lot of time to myself. I hate having to turn people down, but it seems as if I am always doing that. Tomorrow my friend invited me over for dinner, and that should be a lot of fun. We have kind of lost touch, and it should be good for us to get back into the swing of things. Well, I think that has been twenty minutes. I hope you enjoyed my "interesting" train of thought. 
__label__label0 When I first thought about the stream of consciousness writing assignment, I figured my natural stream of consciousness would deliver my views on life and the issues that apply to the everyday. However, all I've been able to think about in the past twenty minutes is a girl. Her name is PROPNAME. We became close towards the end of the summer before I came back to LOCNAME. She lives in LOCNAME so its hard to get to see her very often. One date was all it took. I mean I've known the girl for years, but it became different after this one night. Kind of going from childhood friends to, I don't know, maybe something romantic. If I had known anything was there, I would've stomped on this opportunity a long time ago kind of like if I had known that there were 0 very essential vitamins in California Style Sunny Delight, I would've drunk that my whole life instead of orange juice. When did they come out with Sunny Delight anyways? I don't think it's been around for my entire life but probably pretty close. Possibly when I was five or six years old. At any rate, I always think to myself  could this girl be the one? She's beautiful to start with, and besides that, she's just amazing. I can't spend enough time with that girl. Just going to the playground and swinging with her makes me happy. I got a call from her the other day saying she was going to come see me next weekend. This could possibly be why I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. I really can't wait to see her. Possibly more excited than going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm just packing up my bags and heading down there to see if I can land a job at a local ski resort. I've always wanted to ski bum for a season, so I figured this would be a good chance. And being that the summer in our hemisphere is winter in their hemisphere, it works out  having all summer off. I was actually stressing about this all day being that it has to be in by 0 o clock. I'm leaving for College Station sometime today and I have got so much to do. A police officer gave me a speeding ticket two nights ago on LOCNAME. Now I have to take defensive driving and get my car inspected to get out of this ticket. And this, piled onto everything else that is going on. I'd say my stress level has recently risen to a 0! Nonetheless, I'm getting out of town this weekend and probably the next too. The swells are getting up to 0 feet on the LOCNAME gulf coast this weekend which is unheard of around here, so I want to get out and catch some waves before they recede. Surfing just makes me relax  puts me in a zone where there are no worries. Soccer doesn't do that for me. I played all my life and it was very fun but also came with a lot of pressure. There were many reasons I guess, but I just played to play, not to win a state championship or anything. Well I guess my twenty minutes are up, time to take a shower! 
__label__label0 Well I type kind of slow so I might not get as much in this box as everyone else. Anyway, right now I'm thinking that I have way to many classes and am worried that I might not be able to handle all of them in the same semester. I would have been ok but now I have an SI section for each class and it has filled all my free spaces. On top of that I still have to come back here and study for my lectures every night. I don't have very much free time to do other things. I'm not getting the time I hoped to have when I came to have a good time while I got an education. I don't have any free time to join any organizations or even go out and have a good time. I'm a long way from home so I don't get to see any of my friends or my family very often but I'm trying to make the best of things. I think that I will eventually be ok when I get use to this drastic change in my life. I just kind of wish that I didn't have to start over at this point in my life because I liked the way everything was going for the past few years. Well my twenty minutes are up so I guess that's it. 
__label__label1 Is PROPNAME still on the phone? At 0:00 I can finish this and go to the grocery store. It's on. I wish I could have napster on Ethernet. I am really hungry. I wish I could have worked out more today. I should write what I'm talking about. I wish I could type with the right fingers. Why didn't I learn to do that? It was an important step I missed. I think the grocery store is on red river. I wish the door were shut. I wish somebody had emailed me today. Hopefully zac can help me with calculus. I can't remember anything. The teacher didn't even go over it with us. I'm really nervous about the quiz. Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. Wow this really sucks. I have so much to do. It seems like I do nothing during the day. Maybe I should have stayed at the dance thing. Now I'm getting in the flow of typing. This split keyboard sucks for pecking. I wish I knew what to do about track. The phone is ringing. I miss my sister. I am glad I went to the grocery store last night. I hope dad doesn't get mad about the money I'm spending. I can kind of hear Saturday night live. I don't know how PROPNAME concentrates in front of the TV. I had an itch in my nose. I can't wait until after my quiz. The hamburgers will be good at the KA house. I hope I have time to work out today. I think I will never be the size I want to be. Why do I have a rash on my ass? Its good I took a shower last night. I like my tri delt shirt. It seems like the time is passing very slowly. Only seven more minutes. Should I take a nap after this or study math or eat lunch? Ill ask PROPNAME. Maybe she'll eat with me. I like the cafeteria food. I wish everybody treated the help better. Word perfect sucks. I hate the little green and red squigglies. There are worse things I could do. Somebody's knocking at the door. It's probably PROPNAME. No it's PROPNAME. Is she talking to PROPNAME? Is PROPNAME going to be hungry? Man I hate those squiggly lines! I wonder if I should call the ticket office. I wonder if I'll need to study hard for this class. So far I've only done the pretesting and the writing. It's not even sunny still! That's awesome. I hate the heat. I can't wait until its fall. I love wearing jeans and sweat pants. I can run outside. Maybe then I'll get skinny. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a good voice? Where is she? PROPNAME PROPNAME sucks. She's ugly too. Her boyfriend is gay. Their relationship seems fake. My relationship is good. PROPNAME is great. I'm glad he's doing a frat. I hope they don't be hard on him. That is so gay that they do that to guys. I don't get it. Only two more minutes. It doesn't seem like I've written all that much. How are they going to know anyway? I doubt they'll even read that much of it. Bita talks a lot. She always has. That reminds me of Miss A. She never calls me. Why do I have to call everyone? Nobody ever calls me. PROPNAME emails a lot. I should e mail everyone. I'm much too busy for that. I need to call Dad. I want him to call me right now. At least that guy fixed the Internet. I need to learn to type. Okay I think I can stop now. I still feel like I should write more. Am I a perfectionist? I wonder if we'll learn that in psychology. 
__label__label0 Today I had my third day of classes at ORGNAME. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to ORGNAME so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in LOCNAME, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. 
__label__label1 . STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS. Right now I feel disappointment for skipping my weight training class this morning. I feel sick. Maybe its my sinuses or something. I need to go get my course packet for NTR 000. This weekend I should do homework, but I won't. I'm always behind, I hate that about myself. I can't seem to make myself do right, my roommate encourages me a little, but not enough. She skipped class yesterday too. We have a lot in common, but I wonder how close we really are. I like her, she is cool. My boyfriend thinks she is a bad influence. I love him. He's worried that I might cheat on him while I'm in school, but I won't. I love him so much. My roommate and I listen to music a lot. We enjoy watching videos. It keeps us going. I'm really depressed about my weight. I have been working out, but I still eat too much taco bell and Jester Pizza. I want to be thinner, but not too thin. I torture myself by watching pretty girls on TV. I feel bad about the things I eat. My roommate doesn't help. My boyfriend is satisfied with the way I look. I miss him. I'm going home this weekend. I want to look better for him. I used to be cute. This past summer I gained a lot of weight. I really just wish my stomach were flatter. I never had a stomach before. I watch ORGNAME all the time. They play lots of videos. I'm going shopping this weekend, but I'm not as excited as I should be. Its depressing. I need to pray more. I'm going to church on Sunday. I miss church. I should read my Bible more. I should read more. I like rap, it makes me dance. I enjoy dancing. I'm a pretty good dancer. My boyfriend won't let me dance for him. I try to all the time. He's so cute. We have known each other since we were. ten. He was cute then too. His mom likes methat's a good thing. My grandmother hates him, but we have an understanding. She has her reasons. I should do my homework today. I procrastinate too much. I hate myself for that. I haven't eaten today. I need to get a sandwichno pizza. My favorite singer right now is PROPNAME. I think she is pretty. I wish I had a body like hers. She's skinny. My boyfriend doesn't like skinny girls. My roommate is really confident. She seems to be content with herself. I wish I were. I want to grow my hair out. I'm not going to cut it anymore. My boyfriend will be happy. My grandmother will be thrilled. I miss them. I can't wait to go back to LOCNAME. Times up. 
__label__label0 I like this writing assignment. It seems easy. I know I'm doing this pretty early, but it's okay. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My roommate is playing his music pretty loudly but I don't care because I do the same thing. I wonder if I set my alarm clock. 0:00 is way too early for me. I sure do type slowly. I can still hear my roommate's music. I need to pee, but I can't. I have to wait 00 minutes. This is getting boring. I'm not very thoughtful today. Maybe it's because I am tired. I may go to sleep early today, but I know I won't. I am so glad that I only have two classes tomorrow. My roommate is talking on the phone again. I'm very delighted that I got a cool roommate. Man, only seven minutes passed. I'm getting so tired and bored. My roommate just left. He sure does go out a lot. I hope he doesn't wake me up tomorrow morning. Home. I miss my house, my turtles, my mom, my dad, and my friends. I sure do have lots of electronics in my dorm. I wonder why dogs howl at the moon. Man that was sure random. My keyboard is pretty cool. I still need to pee. Gosh only ten more minutes to go. I am halfway there. My shoulder is starting to hurt. I wonder how many words I can type a minute. Gosh, I'm glad that I am using Word. I cannot spell today. I still need to get my course packet. I'll probably go tomorrow. This is weird. I feel like I am talking to myself, but it is kind of cool. I wonder how people just came up with computers. I am sure glad that I am living in a society with AC. I would so be sweating everyday. It's so hot here, but not as humid as LOCNAME, that is a plus. I wonder if I am supposed to be writing sentences or not. Oh well, I only have five more minutes to go. I don't watch television as much as I used to. I need to start watching the news. I never know what's going on in the world. I don't even know the names of the presidential candidates' running mates. Gosh, I wonder how many words I have typed so far. This page is filling up. There are only three more minutes to go. Then I get to send this in. I wonder if you are going to read this. I need to stop my online slang for writing. My chair sounds like a fart when I move it. Oh oh, two more minutes, and then I'm done. That pretesting sure took a long time to fill out. One more minute left. Man, I lost my thought. I wonder how many seconds are left. My stomach is starting to make noises. There sure are a lot of underlinings in this paper. Woohoo, all done. 
__label__label1 Oh. I don't even have a clue about the purpose of this assignment. Will Professor PROPNAME use this writing assignment as some kind of test? Interesting approach! Oh. wow. I have Psychology this Monday. I wonder what we're going to cover. I still have to read chapter two. Too much homework and so little time! I wonder when mom's going to get home. Is she going to the grocery store again? I have to ask PROPNAME about this. I really want some gum. I really wish that mom would get me some. Oh. this cricket is really annoying. Stop making that sound please! Is it already the cricket season again? Last year, I've seen about a hundred crickets, some dead and some alive, in front of ORGNAME. Now, we have crickets outside of my bedroom window. Great! Wow. PROPNAME has been watching the TV for a long time now. I'll give her fifteen more minutes and then I'm going to go turn off the TV. She should read more. Oh. I have to read my Biology too. I don't exactly want to read it. It's not going to be fun. I really want to go do something exciting so I can kind of clear my head up a little bit. I can probably ask dad to take me to the lake tomorrow. We can probably bring some food and have a picnic there. I really hope dad doesn't already have a plan. I have to ask dad, right away, when he gets home. Anyway, I have to start thinking about my schoolwork. I wonder how people can make perfect 0. 0 gpas. The must be really smart. I should study harder. I need to have better study skills. Oh. this Monday I need to go meet my Biology teacher. She's a really good teacher. I need to tell her that. This woman can really explain stuff. I should go look for the red folder and check for her office hours. I wish her office hour were somewhere from twelve o'clock to two o'clock. Ah. the crickets. the noise. this is really annoying. If this keeps on going, how am I supposed to sleep tonight? I really need lots of sleep. I'm really tired today. Wow. I can't believe I actually vacuumed the whole house today. I never thought I could have done this for just one morning. Amazing! I really want mom to get home soon. I wonder what we're going to have for dinner tonight. I really want chicken noodle soup. I also want some salads. Please get home soon. I'm hungry. Oh. thirty more seconds then I'm done with this writing assignment. If Professor PROPNAME read this he'll probably think that I don't have a stable mind. Ah. time's up. 
__label__label1 I am so glad that I got some emails today. I love when people write me, and tell me what is going on in their life. It also makes me feel good when they ask me to do things with them. I really have a lot to do today. My bulletin board is just so plain. I have to get some color back up there, to make the room appear pretty. I love LOCNAME football, I need to put my poster back up of the football team and schedule. I love the picture my friend sent me in the mail, now I can look at it everyday on my magnetic board. I wonder if my roommate will come back after her class, so we can go eat lunch. I am really hungry. I wonder what they are having for lunch. I need to go check my mail, to see if I got a letter from the company I applied for work. I really hope I get that job, it would be so fun, and I would have some extra spending money. All of these wires on my desk are driving me up the wall. I need to see if I can hide them some way. I need to hook my printer up before I hide all of the wires. People come in and out of this dorm all day long. It is funny all the different schedules people have. I wonder if that screeching noise outside ended up in a wreck. Austin traffic really scares me. People just don't care when they are driving. I have to be the observant one, when I drive tonight. These pigeons outside my window are really getting on my nerves. I hate that purring noise they make. How do they even make that noise? They are such big and ugly birds. Somebody must be taking a shower, because the water is running in the bathroom. What could be making that squeaky noise I hear, it is about every minute. Dorms have all kind of noises. I really like my dorm now, I just need to finish decorating it, since I had to take it down for the sprinkler installation. I worked so hard getting my bulletin board perfect, then I had to rip it down. Now I have the task of putting it all back up, like I had it. I can't wait until I have it back like I had it because the room was just so bright and vibrant, with posters and fabric. I wonder if my theatre teacher will discuss that play we went to see last night. I can't believe he went to the same one. I think it was a little too different for me. I am not really into plays that much, so can I grasp the plot of this one, in order to write a critique? I bet he will say something about it today in class. I can not wait to hear what he has to say. I love that class, it is so much fun. He is so energetic, I look forward to it each day I get to go. I wonder if I will see PROPNAME today. I hope I get to talk to her, she is a nice person. I am getting kind of worried about my roommate, she is not back yet. I really want to go to lunch. I wish the sprinkler installation would be over, because I can't take much more of this drilling. I don't understand why it sounds so close, I thought they were finished with the rooms around us. Maybe these walls are just really thin. I like wearing a hat, I think I will do it more often. I didn't have to fix my hair, it was great. The bells are chiming, I love that sound. Look it is over time to stop. I wonder if I am supposed to end this in a specific way. Oh well, I don't know what to do. This was interesting. 
__label__label1 I guess I'm just supposed to write what I'm thinking right now. I love listening to music. I guess it releases some kind ORGNAME hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. If I'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, I can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME is majoring in that I think. I really miss PROPNAME. He's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. I can't wait to talk to him today  I've already done all of my homework for today and I don't have any more classes today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my hard days. I had a rhetoric class that I was taking but I'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression  she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. I think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. I want to be happy when I'm older  I want to be a child psychiatrist. But as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so I'm going to have to wait on that one. I want to continue to medical school, but I don't know where I want to apply for that. I have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. Oh  My favorite song is on  one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. Okay I have ten more minutes. Okay, my shoes are too small! Have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? It really is painful  I hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 0 and a half and a 0 would make me look like I have clown feet. If you have size 0 feet I'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. I'm just talking about me. I hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else  you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. Maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. But who even cares about that stuff now. Not me! But that's okay. I took an ORGNAME ORGNAME course last year in high school and I loved it. It's what got me interested in Psychology in the first place. I was going to be a photojournalist. But after taking the psych class I decided that I really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. Photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. I also was watching a show on TLC on a family vacation to LOCNAME (dad's idea) and it was an ER show and I really thought that was interesting. I can be easily inspired. Okay my time is up. 
__label__label1 I've never done this before, but hey, whatever. College is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments I've had to do so far for classes. I don't really know what to say. I just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss her. And borrowing her clothes. I miss my little sister, too. It's funny because I didn't think I'd really miss my family and most of the time I don't, but the other night I just got this sporadic mental picture of my Dad. It was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. It sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. Such is growing up. So, no one's going to read this. That's pretty good because I'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. I love that word. I try and use it whenever I can. Ha! This is crazy. Actually, PROPNAME's class is one of the best I have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. I only took it because this girl I know said she knew PROPNAME's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. And he is. And he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. I mean, some of my professors are crazy. I have this one professor who barely speaks English, which is cool and all, but really, how can I learn from someone I can't understand? And the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, "In LOCNAME. " At least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and I've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. I don't get it. Does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in LOCNAME? Because that's what we're studying right now. Bacteria. And it's not even interesting. I mean, who really cares about ERs and lipids and lysosomes? Well, I guess that's a pretty dumb question. Of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. I personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. Really, guy. But I have to take the class, whether I want to or not. I only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, I'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. Ah, geology. My eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. After this, I have some serious catching up to do. And it's not because I miss my classes or anything. I mean, I don't even drink. Except for wine, and that's really only when I eat out, which I do less and less these days. These dayswhat am I talking about?! I've been here for less than a month. It feels like I've always been here, though. Which is weird. I love LOCNAME, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. Seriously, they're nasty. And what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? They're not, most of them anyway. My neck hurts. That professor I was talking about earlier, the one who speaks English very poorly? He sings in class. Right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. And it's not like he's singing to himself. I mean, he's wearing a mike. We can all hear him loud and clear. And the only song he knows how to sing is "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning. " Except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. He's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. Anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, I would never go to class. That's pretty weird of me, right? 
__label__label0 I'm writing my first college paper I guess you could call it a paper no offense off course it is a relief from some of the reports I wrote in high school I'm already missing high school a little bit but I wouldn't give up the fun I'm having now for anything especially my home town LOCNAME anyways its 0:00 and guess ill quit writing about 0:00 the music I'm listening to is way too loud but for some reason it helps my feelings just flow onto the paper better if I keep going at this pace this paper could be very long its 0:00 now whoa I've all ready thought of a lot of things right now I'm at study hours for my frat phi kappa sci baby yeah woo hoo that has been an experience I've never met some any people so fast in my life it makes college life like twice as fun and I would recommend a frat to any guy its not just the drinking either which is what everybody seems to think speaking of drinking my court appointment has even been made for my contributing but I can't get into that because my mom said so I actually talk to my parents a lot more than I thought I would my mom is still doing my laundry that is a sweet deal I'm not going to mess up my dad is pissed because he doesn't think I'm taking enough responsibility or something like that the little paper clip dude with eyes is kind of freaking me out right about now he keeps giving me these weird looks there are a bunch of weird people here at LOCNAME it doesn't seem fair for me to be so quick to judge but I can't help it the other day I saw a guy and a girl walking and holding hands and as I crossed the street I saw that it was actually two chicks I know that being prejudice or something but it took me by surprise my roommates mom just called me and I'm talking to her now and my mind is wandering and I'm done talking to her now and I'm supposed to give my roommate a message but I've forgot already because I was to busy typing anyways its 0:00 and this is a little harder than I thought it would be I don't think I usually think about things for 00 min strait hey there's a first time for everything I just looked around my dorm room for something to think about so I could let my feelings flow on to the page but I'm drawing a blank I think that phone call messed up my train of thought anyways I can't believe how early I have to get up tomorrow I have to get up at 0:00 an tonight I'm supposed to stay out late and there's a pretty good chance that I will come home stumbling and laughing uncontrollably is that a word it probably is but I misspelled it or something five min left and I've got my first grade in psy000 sweet deal thong thong thong whoa sorry got into the music for a second its still to lo. whoa my next door neighbor just banged on the wall how freaky is that I should turn it down now. actually I'm going to turn it up hahaha sweet I'm so freaking mean anyways 0 min left and these last min are taking a lifetime whoa the paperclip just winked at me and I think he's smiling I'm really hungry but I don't know what to eat peanut butter sandwich ramen fishes crack. whoa my roommate just turned on limp as loud as he possible can sweet losing my sight losing my mind wish somebody. all right 0:00 uno minuto mas I was Spanish for tres years in Spanish and you've already heard like 00 percent of my Spanish vocabulary the clock just hit 0:00 
__label__label0 Well, this is interesting, writing for 00 minutes straight, I don't know if I've ever written for that long continuously before, this should be a welcome challenge. My roommate is bustling around the room, packing for retreat, and he forgot to do this assignment, he's running around the room packing and trying to do this assignment, haha, it's kind of funny. sucks for him that he forgot about this, he's going on a campus crusade trip this weekend, so I have the entire room to myself, wonder what things I can do with that luxury, hmmmm, time to ponder what interesting things can happen this weekend. Cosby show is on, I'm waiting to watch my favorite cartoon at 0 o'clock, dragon ball z. Japanese animation at it's best. I think I just have a thing for fighting and energy balls flying through the air and planets being blown up. I guess I'm just like a stereotypical guy. I'M football starts this weekend. I'm pretty excited. I signed up through ORGNAME. known as chinese bible study. should be fun since I get to meet some new people considering I came from a pretty strong contingent of people I already knew from the LOCNAME area, mainly centered around plano. LOCNAME is a really cool place. more things to do then in plano. but. not having a car kind of sucks. can't just go wherever. unless I feel like walking. which doesn't happen very often. only thing that is troubling is the weather. so freaking hot and humid and. just. nasty. can't wait until fall and winter when it's nice and cool outside with some rain and some mist. that'd be nice. none of this 000 degree weather. for a few months at least. Just got done with classes today. chemistry. right now it's pretty much a review of chemistry I I took in high school. so. not too troublesome yet. but the teacher is pretty good. she's really into the chemistry and lectures well even though most of the people already know how to do everything from high school. but it's nice to see the drive she has to teach and get the information through to us. my roommate just stocked up on food. he made a pilgrimage to the ORGNAME because he's lucky and didn't have a class today. no class at all. what a punk. well. I shouldn't complain. I have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. that's pretty nice. it's just calculus discussion too. so. I can get away with like. dozing off in that class. I'm going to lake travis this weekend with some friends. that should be pretty fun. get away from the city for a bit. and. get nice a dark. hope I don't get burned. and. don't want to turn the color of burnt toast either. I will no longer look chine se. hmmm. should I get a hair cut this weekend? I'm thinking about changing my hair. want to cut it shorter. because. it's nice and hot around here in Austin. shorter hair would be nice. considering I do walk everywhere for now. hmmm. provocative. maybe I'll ask some people what they think. then I can trek down to the drag and find a place to get my hair chopped. or. ear's lowered. whatever is the lingo nowadays. I have a lot of reading to do this weekend. what a bummer. I have to read the 0 books out of the odyssey for Greek. and I have a quiz on Monday. I have to read chemistry and start the hw. I have some calc hw I should do. and. need to read for psych. what a weekend. tons and tons of reading. but. football on Sunday. get to watch some ORGNAME and get to see how well my fantasy players do. hopefully I'll win in fantasy football this week. lost last week. kind of made me mad. my team didn't produce. but it happens. hmmm. hope I get to play basketball this weekend too. haven't played in a few days. and didn't play as much as usual this week. wonder if my skills have deteriorated. guess it'd be a good time to find out. just play some pick up game against some friends. hopefully I'll get to dominate. but. in all likeliness. I'll be toasted. nicely toasted. oh well. it happens. I'm really tired right now. I should have slept earlier. I don't know though. I slept around 00:00. I should be okay. that's 0 hours. maybe it was because my roommate was snoring so I couldn't get any sleep. kept waking up in the middle of the night to that hideous sound. that'll keep you awake. but once I hit him. he shut up. should keep that in mind more often. hehehe. hmmm. I'm trying to submit this. because I've written for more then 00 minutes. but I can't. hopefully I'll be able to turn this in on time. I only have an hour and a half to turn this in. well. hopefully all will work out for the good. 
__label__label1 I hate you. I hate how you have the power to hurt me. I hate how I called you wanting to merely tell you about "our" song being on tv and I got shot down. I hate how you called me some other girl's name thinking it was her that called. I hate how you can call some other girl and start to like her so soon after we broke up. You said that you had feelings for me merely 0 days ago and how can you forget about me so quickly? Was I just not that special to you that you could forget about me so soon? I hate you for not wanting to have a long distance relationship with me even though you're only like 0 hours away. I hate you for making me hurt so badly inside. I hate you for making me feel that horrible feeling you get in your chest when someone just breaks up with you. I hate you for having the power to invoke such emotion within me. I thought that you were different. I thought that you of all people wouldn't hurt me. You always told me to give you the benefit of the doubt and I finally learned to do that. You always said how you never wanted to hurt me and you never did until last night. Nothing you ever did was as painful as that. I just felt like someone had stabbed me and run over me a few times. I care so much about you still and I just don't understand you. You told me that you didn't want to have a girlfriend this first year at school, but then why in the hell are you calling a girl to get something started with her? How could you lie to me when I asked you who she was? You of all people never lied to me and never hurt me, but last night you ruined everything that I had made you out to be. I had you on a pedestal from all the other guys that I've been with and you proved me wrong. I wish you could feel all the hurt that I feel right now. I wish you could hurt so much that you don't know what to do about it. I wish you could take this hurt away from me because I don't deserve to feel this way. All I ever did was care about you and be good to you. I'm not sorry I still have feelings for you because you were just that special to me that it will take me awhile to get over you. I could never call some other guy and start talking to him so soon. It's so early and not fair to the other person. It took you forever to ask me out because you wanted to make sure you were over PROPNAME but what about PROPNAME? How can you talk to her so soon if I know you still have feelings for me? Am I just that easy to get over? I thought I was so much more than that. I'm not stupid, PROPNAME. I know you all too well. I know when you lie to me, but I guess I didn't know you too well because I never thought you could hurt me. I never thought you could be with another girl so soon after me. You told me not to start something with another guy to fill that void of you. Is that what you're doing because that's not fair. I just can't believe you. I wish there was something you could do to make me feel better, but I don't think there is. I don't even know how we can be friends anymore. I can't trust you even as a friend. I now know that you can lie to me. I wish it wasn't like this between you and me. I wish we could be together because things were so great with you that I didn't want to let it go. You were the best boyfriend I ever had but I don't know about that anymore. You ruined that whole perfect picture for me. I hate you for making me feel such sadness. How can you do that? 
__label__label0 It's hard to believe that my first year ORGNAME college has begun. It's almost like I am at summer camp for a week, and I will be returning home in a week. However, that is just a false reality in my head. It's hard for me to grasp everything. It seemed to happen so fast. I left behind my family, my friends, my cheerleading squad, my town. Everything that is familiar has been traded in for a world of experience and confusion. What time is my next class? Where IS my next class? Where is everyone going tonight? It's mass confusion in my head. I want to be successful at college: academically, spiritually, emotionally and physically. I have already begun a steady workout and eating habits that make me feel good about my self, and so far I have enjoyed all of my classes. However, there's still that little thought in the back of my head that I am not getting everything done. I feel like there's this list of things to do ALL THE TIME and no matter what I do, I will never get them done. I have to admit, my first week of college was completely awful. I hated every moment of it. I cried everyday, called my mom, acted like a real baby. It was as if there was this strike against me that made sure NOTHING went my way. But as I have gotten used to the schedule and made a few new friends things seem to be looking up. I still feel like I don't fit in. This miniature "society" at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME is like a town within itself, and all of the citizens in this "town" seem so superficial. I don't feel like I have met anyone with one natural thought in his or her head. I can't believe how strange it is. It's as if the whole campus is full of sorority girls and fraternity guys. (No offense, it's just not me) I want to feel like a part of things but for the life of me I can't get in "the loop. " I make a few friends here and there, but as far as personalities, I feel like I am too real for everyone I have met. I am hoping that by next semester I will begin to make this dorm room my home and the people around me my family. It's not so much that I am homesick as it that I just miss fitting in. Back in High School there were no worries. Everything was laid out for you; only a few minor decisions to be made. I fit in so well. I knew my way around, I knew what was going on at all times; it was like a utopia in my little town of Sugar Land, LOCNAME. The only problem with the whole "high school thing" is that I was definitely a stereotype. (Another superficial moment in my life) I was a cheerleader all through High School. People at my school assumed I was a snobby, selfish girl who only thought the world of myself as well as my other cheerleader friends. They never even got the chance to know me. I can say right off- I am far from snobby. I love everyone and everything in this world. I am out to harm no one, except my self emotionally every once in a while! Why do teenagers feel the need to be so judgmental of each other? Why is it that I can't drive my Mustang Convertible in my cheerleading uniform without feeling like I am straight out of a "Saved By The Bell" episode? I am thinking that over time, an image has been created in everyone's mind on how things should be, and how people should look. Who is to say who and what we are? Why do I feel like I am always answering to someone? I can't make a decision without someone LOVING IT and someone else HATING IT. I hate the fact that the media has pounded into our brains what and who we should be. This is real life people. When you are doled out your genes-physical and personality-you don't get a choice. Some people honestly can't help the way they are. So why do we take the time to stop and make them feel even worse about their insecurities? I think the answer is within our OWN insecurities. It's sick that people feel better about themselves after putting someone else down. If a girl thinks she has ugly hair, she may announce that "that girl over there" has a horrible sense of fashion. Does that take away from the fact that she has ugly hair? I don't think so! So why has it become so necessary to step on whomever it takes to make you look better? My mind is full of these questions. I just know that as long as I am here, I plan to stay the real, down to earth girl that I am, as to not become a victim of my own insecurities. 
__label__label0 How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average PROPNAME. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the "s" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 00 minutes. 
__label__label0 So here I go. I'm writing. Don't know what though cause I think this is hard. Tapping fingers. click, click, click I wish it was Friday This is very artificial. Rereading my words  I don't like it. I thought I would have more to say, but so far not much is coming up. I'm a very bad typist? whatever. Let's go on. I like my rings. I have only four on my fingers, I think I need more. All silver. There was a pause there. So much for writing for a full 00 minutes, including ALL thoughts. :)I like that. Look(!),I bet I don't even get a scrolly bar thing. Yes, my one page stream, more like trickle, of consciousness. So anyways I guess I'll be like everyone else and tell you about my dog. He's a cutie. A mutt but I love him the more for it. I think he's his own breed or dog or whatever. Yup, he's a shortie. We're always tripping over him, poor thing. (Pause) Tap, tap, tap. I wish I could type faster, like the girl next to me. Damn her. oohooh, my time's almost up. Did I mention I like my nails too. I painted them real pretty. I'll have to show them to PROPNAME. I can't wait until Friday. It's been forever since we've all gone out. Time's up. 
__label__label1 What is going through my head. hmmm. That's a good question. Well. I feel really skeptical about this whole college thing. I mean its all cool and all but I get a little intimidated by the whole process. I mean all these people in my classes kind of freak me out. I am used to dealing with large amounts of people but WOW. I sit there and wonder how the professors do it all. I mean yes, they have teacher's aides, but I am sure that the work is tremendous. All the schoolwork is a little new to me. I am used to a lot of busy work and worksheet. Don't get me wrong. I was in advanced classes, but I am not that used to every class having mandatory readings all the time. I am also a little scared of going out. I was always a social person in high school but the whole going out and meeting new people is a little scary. I mean, the people seem really friendly and nice, but a lot of them seem really snobby and a little unapproachable. so it makes a person hesitate. I am really an outgoing girl but I hesitate for some reason here. In other environments, I usually don't. It is strange though. It like I am afraid of making new friends. How silly is that??? Also, I am afraid of the whole freshman 00 thing. I mean, how could people gain weight? You walk around all day and go to class. And when you're not doing that you are reading or going out? Well, I know the food isn't that great, but 00 pounds! Wow! Also, this whole party scene is a bit intimidating for me. I want to go, but I am so scared because of all the storied I've heard. Funny what you realize when you just sit here and let your mind go. I need to learn to type faster so I can go as fast as I am thinking. Oh well. that's what you get for not taking keyboarding in junior high. Well. I am thinking my 00 minutes of typing is up. So I will check all my spelling and turn this in. 
__label__label1 My throat hurts. I had a little too much troubling trying to spell throat. I've now discovered hat my brain works much faster than I can type. I hope I'm not getting sick. All I can think about is this assignment. Now I'm thinking about all the things I need to do today. And this weekend, I have to write a rough draft of a paper. I need to go to the library or something. It's really cold in here. My eye itches. I hope they found the people that were smoking in the building last night. That's probably why my throat hurts today. We could smell it through the vents. I need to go to the store. Now my nose itches. Our room looks kind of messy. Can I listen to music while doing this assignment? They'll never know. I have to watch the clock and stop at 00:00. I remember when I heard this song for the first time. I hope it rains today. I don't like ORGNAME ORGNAME. She seems really mean and pushy. All I can think about is what should I think about next so I can type it. I need to email my mom after this. I'm trying not to, but I can't help but sensor this. She needs a different haircut. She would look better. Ouch. That hurt my sunburn. I have 0 minutes to go. Oh I really like this part of the song. I love jazz. I think I need to buy some cough drops. I'll out that on my list of things to get at the store. I really like this part of the song too. I need to get my math homework done early. Why did it repeat, I didn't tell it to repeat. Or maybe I did. What was that? I think it was talking chickens. When you turn the sound down, not all commercials are as selfexplanatory as you might think. I needed to know that. I want to go somewhere. I need to drive. I just don't know how to get anywhere. I'm just killing time until the 00 minutes are up. Oh laundry tips, I've got to watch. And look at that, times up. 
__label__label0 I am a freshman at LOCNAME but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and PROPNAME brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 0rd week ORGNAME school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME. LOCNAME is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see PROPNAME, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and "Leave it to Beaver" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a "real job" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my PROPNAME said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 0 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 0 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that ORGNAME is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 0 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here wondering why he doesn't take a better interest in me. I'm wondering if he has started to see this girl PROPNAME. Am I pitying myself or am I really this strange? Do I actually think that he could love me? Maybe he does, but it's been only a week and he hasn't spoken to me like he used to. I love him so much, God. Why has he changed? Or have I changed? It's been one week though! One week! My heart hurts so much, Lord. Please help me. I feel so helpless, so caught up in something that seems so ridiculous. I love him madly yet he treats me with such irreverence and formality. Then again, maybe it's all in my head, as always. That night in front of his yard. It was wonderful. His eyes. His lips. His smile. The sincerity poured from every valve. I cannot bear to think of him with someone else. I scream with pain at the very thought and I wonder why. Why does this have to happen? Why did I have to fall in love with someone who would fall in love with someone else? I can't stand this. I have to do my schoolwork tomorrow and I don't think I can concentrate. I'm dying. My brain is itching and I'm scraping at the walls to get out of something I am not even in. I hate this city. I hate it here. Why am I even here? I look outside at the night sky and see nothing. I look outside and I can't remember who I used to be. I can't remember what made me happy. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. I look at the street and I can't remember the last time I smiled. It was today, I know. but not the last time I felt it. My heart feels empty. My mind is gone. My eyes are filled with tears and I cannot bear to fathom his leaving me. He is everything. There is no one else. Nor will there ever be. I miss beyond words and I cry almost every night. WHAT HAS HE DONE? WHAT HAS HE DONE? Most likely nothing. Maybe I'm being over dramatic. Maybe I'm not being practical. But it hurts. I saw them, God. I saw them together. He likes her, I can see it. I stood like a fool and watched them. I STOOD LIKE A FOOL. I'm so scared. I'm sitting here in my own selfpity crying my eyes out and wondering why. MY laundry is almost done. It's 00:00. Why, God? Can't I keep him? I miss him. I'm not happy here. I will never be happy again, I fear. Not truly happy. I am not complete without him. I'm crying loudly. I fear the neighboring people will hear. But what does it matter? What could they do? I'm hurt. Embarrassment is nothing. Love is nothing. only once. This must be it. I believe a person only falls once. madly and once. I was so wrong to believe that I was not in love with him. I was so wrong to have said and done all those things. God, help me. I will die like this. God, please help me. It hurts so much. I cannot bear to think that he could love someone else. Not after all that time. Not after everything. Why does he throw it away? Why can't he love me? Simply because I am not there? BULL! That's not true. I still love him. I cry. I miss him. I write tot him. What does he do? He comforts me with lackluster professions of love. Maybe I'm making a mistake again. I used to be so sure of everything. I used to be so sure of what he felt. Now I feel and know nothing. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of writing for this assignment. It's much too private and it's so hard to determine the stream of consciousness. It is filled with idle, petty things. with no purpose. It floats from one island of topic to another without care and without remorse. I hear screams in the other room. I wonder what is happening. Is she excited or raving? I hope she isn't hurting. Because I am and I fear I cannot take it. I won't kill myself. But I do wonder how long I can survive. I've never believed that I could live to see past 00. maybe even 00. I'm so tired. I want to go home. I didn't before but now I do. I wonder if it is because I want to lure him into staying beside me. to keep him near. tightening the leash. God, help me please. Give me some sort of sign. An epiphany. something. It hurts so much to remember. I'd rather not think about it. It's 00:00. He'll be calling in an hour. if he cares. If he wants to tell me that it's over. I'm so hollow. Maybe this is my punishment. Maybe this I what I get for having been so cruel and unloving. Now I love and the tables have turned. the eye has changed visions and my life has become worthless. This is what you get rings through my ears. I'm sick. I only want peace. I want a comforting arm. I want a hug. I want a kiss. I want love. I'm so terrified of losing him by losing myself. I cannot change because then he will not love me. I'm not even sure if I am doing this correctly. I'm doing this in a form of a prayer rather than what I'm thinking directly. Either way, it's something. Oh, Art. Please, say something I need to hear. I myself do not know what it is. but I need you to say it. Maybe I secretly want you to tell me it's over so that I can find another person to fill the void. But whom could possible begin to? No one. You were the one. You are the only. You always will be. Ten years from now when I watch you get married I will still love you as strongly. There is no better person. Your soul is so true and so lovely. so pure and untouched. I was lucky enough to glimpse that. I was lucky enough to love you. Thank you God. Forgive me, please. I should have loved you better. I'm staring at your painting and I can't help but wonder why I screwed it up again. Why am I self destructive. I need you. I need you to hug me. To kiss me. To tell me that you want me. Please. Please please please. I'm so weak. I'm so pointless. This is purposeless. Help me, God. My back aches. My eyes ache. My feet ache. My life is gone. Music could soothe me before. now nothing does. Not friends, not family, not anything. I wish I could figure out who I am. or be told who I am. I cannot figure it out. Please God let him love me. I'm terrified of what I will become without him. Oh God, please hurry. Please send me something. I need a drink. I wish I hadn't done so many things. I wonder who is online. who could make me feel better? PROPNAME? Does he love me? I don't love him. Although I wish he loved me. Why am I so selfish? Why can't I be good and whole? What did I do that was so wrong? So many things. Please help me. It's 00:00. I'm done. 
__label__label0 I wander if I will go to psychology today. I don't feel like it since my car is in the shop today. I still need to go to the bank and return the DVD player. Should I exchange it or get my money back since I don't have much money. At least I don't have to go to work. I can't wait until I graduate only one more year. Oh yeah I have to do some reading today but I am having trouble concentrating. My thumb is hurting from typing. I think it is mainly from my old job but typing is aggravating it. I guess my thoughts are drying up because I am trying to write but I normally can't stop thinking about stuff. I really want to go to LOCNAME but PROPNAME is saying we don't have money. oh well we will see. She is frustrating because she is not focused on her future. I just want us to be done with school as soon as possible. I can't wait until I start working I hate not having enough money. I probably need another job now because I only work about 00 hours a week. when I get back I need to put my car for sale. It better not take to long in the shop like last time. I'm getting tired of this writing. I really need to get my stuff together so I don't fall behind in my reading but most of the reading is really boring. psy is kind of interesting but architecture and accounting, two classed I like are boring to read. Ill be glad when I only have a job and not a job and school. it should be fun to go home this week but I wont go back for a long time today. I'm tired of hearing about those damn firestone tires. I should invest in stock. the tv is on that's why I'm rambling. PROPNAME is going to be bought by chase LOCNAME. I new I should have bought their stock. But no money to back it. c'est la vie I don't know if I spelled that right but oh well. well I'm just about done and none to soon. I wander what I will do tonight I'm not going to psy today. today was a lazy day. well see you next assignment. have a nice day. 
__label__label0 I'm starting to write this at six twenty five, It's really cold in this computer lab, I wish they would turn the air conditioner down, do they know how to do that, would they do it if I asked them, probably not, but I wish they would, there sure is a lot of typing noise going on in the room, no one is talking, I am thinking more things that I am actually typing, it is really hard to write everything that I think and I type a lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, I am not thinking of much right now, the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it, he probably won't read it though, and he probably won't really think it is dumb, there are probably students who write dumber ones than me. I am horrible at typing, I am making all kinds of mistakes, I hope I can read this a when I finish it, or else there will be a problem, brrrr It's really cold in here, I sure wish they would make it warmer. My fingers and my feet are freezing, and I'm already bad enough at typing, the cold makes it even harder to type, geeze I'm going to have to do a lot of spell checking after I finish this, I only have about ten minutes of typing left, I just heard someone's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab, I always hear phones ring in here anyways, I wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that, they should turn their phones off, so they don't disrupt other people, even though personally it doesn't bother me if I hear a phone ring but I guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying, gosh I can't spell worth anything, I'm hardly going to be able to read this when I get done, I hope I can decipher it, my feet are freezing, I keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that's the point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated. I wonder if its raining outside, that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere, I wonder why I thought of that, hhhmmm, I saw all the clouds earlier outside, it was really dark and scary looking, I hope it rains a lot more, more than yesterday, it didn't rain enough yesterday, I love when it rains, it's better than the sunshine, I wonder if that means I'm a negative person, it can't though cause I am such a positive and optimistic person, well at least I think of myself as optimistic, I try to be optimistic but sometimes its hard, like last week I was so stressed out with all the band stuff, I'm really glad I quit band cause it was too hard but it was hard deciding to quit too, I wonder if anybody in band misses me, I wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me, I hope some of them did, but I guess that's not a good thing to hope considering I have a boyfriend, I really miss my boyfriend a lot, and I just thought about macaroni and cheese for some weird reason, I wonder why I thought of that, maybe cause both me and my boyfriend like macaroni and cheese, I'm such a horrible typist, this typing is probably the worse I've ever done, I only have a couple of minutes left to go, gosh time really went but fast since I was just typing anything I thought, I wonder if the professor will really read this, he is a really cool professor, I like him a lot, but now if he does read this he's probably going to think I was sucking up to him but that's not true cause I really love psychology, that's a hard word to spell, well its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it's spelled, I remember when I was in the spelling bee in 0th grade, I think it was fourth grade, maybe it was third, I remember my ex best friend who was in my third grade class, I didn't really know her then but now she is really stupid but I don't really want to think about that right now and my twenty minutes is up so I guess I'll stop typing! 
__label__label0 So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. PROPNAME is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like LOCNAME and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that PROPNAME got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of LOCNAME for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word LOCNAME programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to LOCNAME next year. Not LOCNAME LOCNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the LOCNAME people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end 
__label__label1 As I walk down the middle ORGNAME campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, I feel like a star in the huge night sky. With so many stars scattered throughout the sky, I seem to go unnoticed and lost. This is a feeling that I have seldom felt. As an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen I have always been one of the brightest stars. Just a month ago, I seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. I now feel lonely and intimidated as I embark on this new phase in my life. I feel like I no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. Knowing that if I do not obtain a B in Chemistry 000, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. Can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? As I search for answers, I question whether or not I made the right decision to choose to attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, or if I'm even college material at all. What am I saying? Going to college was never an option for me. I want a good life for my family and I, and I've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. My parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. However, I could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support I have received from my family. Throughout my life, I would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. Though I regard them so highly, I also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. The transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that I have left behind were not so great. It is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because I accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. I feel that this is somewhat peculiar because I realize that even if I was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. Eventually I would be left behind. As I work to achieve and to be the best I can be, I hope that along the way I will find the happy, positive person that I once was and know I still am. 
__label__label0 Goodness gracious! I am so tired of returning to this page that I absolutely don't know what else to write about nor say except for HELP! This is like my fourth time trying to complete this assignment and I am so tired of it but it is to late to complain now so I might as well shut up and continue on writing or shall I say typing. It looks again like I will be going to bed after midnight, I hope not but I do have a lot of assignments that I still need to complete. My most important assignment will be to get organized because going at this rate I will have a hell of a freshman year just trying to keep up. I am doing a little better now with following my syllabus but I still have a long way to go. Maybe when I get a job I will learn how to manage my time more wisely and I will be able to develop better study skills. My fiance' tells me that I have good study skills I just worry to much and stress myself out over small unimportant things that have nothing to do with my classes or myself. To be honest, I do believe that I do get stressed out over every little thing but I think that I am getting a lot better at handling different situations, like this one. My biggest problem is that I really miss him and it is so hard being here in LOCNAME all alone while he is in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Hopefully after this year we will be able to come up with a compromise and a solution to all of our problems and concerns. I miss him and I am really looking forward into seeing him in a couple of months. Well, my time is about up and I really need to go so that I can begin to tackle my other UT coursework. I have to make my grades so that they won't make me. 
__label__label0 this is now the third time I am writing this paper and I am honestly pretty sick of it. the first time I wrote this, I hit a delete button and erased my entire paper. the second time, the system went down so I couldn't submit my writing. hopefully this time everything will go as planned. I don't really pay much attention usually to how thoughts enter my mind but I think I know generally how my mind works. as long as there is nothing around me stimulating my thoughts I generally think about my insecurities (I am always thinking about how things could be different if say, I were prettier, or smarter, or more outgoing, or whatever), singing a song in my head (whether it be from the radio or a commercial), or stressing myself out over a test or something. if I do see something, like a young couple walking a dog in a park for example, I first take the event for what it is. t might think to myself "oh what a cute couple" or "that is a cute dog. " as the event passes though, I tend to relate whatever I just saw to me personally. I would probably think to myself, "I want to get a dog once I get my own apartment. " my thoughts would quickly digress as I would think of other things I could do with my own place. I would imagine decorating the walls, planting a garden, or even in what part of the city I would want my place to be in. my point is that my thoughts rarely stay on one subject matter. I quickly move from one thing to another, forgetting about whatever it was that I was just thinking about. thoughts simply lead to other thoughts, with one small detail changing the mind track completely. 
__label__label0 My main thoughts right now consist of music. I am thinking of a new song that I wrote about my thoughts on the people that I have seen at LOCNAME. Music I feel is the greatest thing in the world because I get to release all my emotions through a song. I think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. These reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. Surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. I don't believe any of them write their own songs, so I can't see why people would think they are talented. This brings me to something else I do not like about people, they are generally fake. What I mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. For example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. This things I do not do and hopefully never will. I feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. I thought by coming to ORGNAME that I would see less of this type of attitude from people but I now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. From this point I would like to say that UT is great(except for parking)and that I do like more people here then I did in high school. I am not sure what I want to do with the education I am receiving from this school but I hope that very soon I will recognize my calling in life. 
__label__label1 . Stream of consciousness well, in other words, free association. I can accommodate this assignment. It's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied. As I was walking home from a stressful day of calculus, chemistry, and psychology, I passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building. The animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking. On normal circumstances, squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans. However, this squirrel continued to hunt for food as I walked by it. I stopped and watched it, it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object, try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent. Curious I continued to watch, wondering what else it would do. I approached the squirrel, closer and closer. When I had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground, attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings. Fantastic! I never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself. I had always thought they would run and jump away. I remained crouched on the sidewalk as I continued to watch this curious little squirrel. After some time it started slowly approaching me. I continued to watch it, much like a predator stalking its prey. Without motion or movement I crouched and stared at it. It came to within 00 inches of me. How wonderful! The squirrel wasn't afraid to come towards a human. It remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel. Of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances. I was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel. At one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street, it found a mass of dumped bread. The rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory. Once there the squirrel began to eat. After eating half of the portions, he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread. Not finding a place, I began to try to help. I grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel. I realized I was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building. I was trying to help my new little friend. Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people. I felt anger, why would someone do that, I'm interacting with this squirrel. After it ran into the tree, it didn't come back down. At some point I left. In retrospect, I think I spent almost 00 minutes observing the squirrel. I was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions, but afterwards, amazingly, I was calm and I actually had an enjoyable time playing with it. I also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel. I never knew that they were as smart as I observed, I also realized even more what incredible running, jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have. Some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste, but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening. Many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world. A squirrel having so many complexities. Amazing. What about the human being or the human mind. The complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible! So many questions. It's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting. Wow very very crazy. 
__label__label1 Ok I have to type for twenty minutes straight. This is kind of odd, I've never done anything like this before so I don't quite know what to do! I should be doing my economics homework but forget it, I'll do it later. I don't even understand it anyways. Calculus is a pain in the back too, I'll wait until Monday to do that homework. I can't wait to go home this weekend and see all my old friends. It's been a while since we've all hung out. I hope I don't miss any really good parties this weekend, but I probably will. In a little while I have to go take a shower and get ready to go out with the girls at the house. We'll probably go to 0th Street or something like that. I'm glad I finally get to go out tonight, I've been sitting in my room for a week straight. Ok I'm bored and am running out of things to say already. I have nothing else to think about right now! ORGNAME ORGNAME is on the TV and I'm getting annoyed with PROPNAME whining. Why is the TV on this channel anyways? I guess my roommate put it on. I'm glad she's gone right now. I needed some peace and quiet. I'm getting real hungry I hope PROPNAME wants to go eat soon. Gosh I still have another load of laundry I have to do before I leave tomorrow. I get to sleep in until one tomorrow because I don't have class until 0. That rocks. My room is so messy but I'm way too lazy to clean it right now. It's dusty more than cluttered. Oh well, I'll get over it. Hold on my phone is ringing. It's my boyfriend PROPNAME just saying hi as usual. I wish I saw him more. It's a lot easier now that I'm in LOCNAME but it's still not the same as living in the same town. Oh I totally forgot that he can't go to LOCNAME LOCNAME this weekend, looks like I'll be without him again. I really need to catch up with some of my old friends this weekend. We need to party and hang out like we used to. I might end up going to the high school football game if there is nothing else to do. I just don't want to look like a hasbeen with a bunch of high school students and then a college student just chilling out there. Ha ha that might be pretty funny actually. I'll get PROPNAME to come with me so I don't feel too stupid. Oh I like this song. I wanted to go to the concert but the tickets were all sold out. Speaking of tickets I never did get the PROPNAME PROPNAME tickets for the September show in LOCNAME. I can't believe I forgot to get them. Now I'll never get tickets. Looks like I'll miss out on yet another awesome concert. At least I'm in LOCNAME now. No good bands come to LOCNAME LOCNAME, so I'll get to go to plenty of concerts here. I still haven't gotten my stupid Ethernet Card yet. I went to the computer store earlier but they didn't have any more for laptops. This stupid thing isn't worth all the trouble! This song is so annoying. I need to find that remote control right now. Much better. I think this is PROPNAME's CD. He has plenty of mine so it's ok if I don't give this back for a while. He won't miss it. Ok I really am so bored and hungry it's unreal. I need to take a shower but I'll just wait until this thing is done. Two more minutes. I can do that. I want to go dancing tonight. That sounds like fun. None of my friends back in SA want to go so I'll find some of the KD's to go with me. My room is so crowded with pointless junk. I should take some of it back home this weekend but I probably won't just because I'll forget or something will come up. I need to get this roll of film developed sometime soon so I can put some new pictures up. I'm sick of looking at all these old ones. Well my time is just about up for this thing so bye bye for now! 
__label__label1 It's too late to really be writing anything I think but then again I'm here aren't I? Hard to believe I am if you were to ask me where I was going to be twenty years from now it wouldn't be here. I miss my Mom and Dad though I'm not supposed to be there either. Isn't there a time when you're supposed to stop writing about your mom and dad. I'm worried that I'm not writing what I'm supposed to or that I'm not doing this naturally What is naturally anyways I mean it seems like kind of a cop out really. Naturally is a lot harder to accomplish than it looks wouldn't you say oh whoa is me I keep messing up my words and I'm not sure if this is even supposed to look pretty or what the thing with this stupid laptop is how stupid it really is It keeps on jumping up and down to the thing or in the middle of this it so it is impossible to get things down. Is natural easy for you? I wonder if that is true It's even harder to believe it is only 00 00 Whatever happened to going to bed early? I was going to attempt to do that you know Go to bed early It seems that whenever I am away from home these things occur The thing is I do this all the time. write without thinking except I do think about how things are spelled and I can't do this now Or it would take way too much time. Are you guys actually going to read this? I'm sure there are many others who are writing more fascinating things than me. I wish I could think of something funny to say then maybe I'd get an A what's funny I wonder. I wish I was in bed I'm sooo tired I haven't slept a wink I'm so tired my mind is on the brink I wonder should I get up and get myself a drink oh oh o oh I'm so tired Oh who will save your soul to me that means everything you know the songs in your head have nowhere to go except leaving the words on the page an I supposed to be speaking in poetry here? Or will I get counted off ? Are you supposed to be wondering what you get counted off for in college I wonder? My fingers are starting to hurt but the only way I can write this stream of consciousness is by lifting my hands off the keyboard because otherwise the problem arises. I've been thinking about ORGNAME lately and how much I miss it? But do I? What is here for me that ORGNAME doesn't have Why friends of course yet do I have friends? I have PROPNAME I guess though I wish more than anything I had more maybe he'd like me better Shoulders are always cramping up do they do that in others ? In tours Whose reading this anyways? Are my thoughts interesting to you I wish I had a yewl leaf or a yule log Yule that's such a cool word reminds me of Christmas I sound like a goddamn Theater major being all dramatic. What is so wrong with being dramatic I wonder What is so wrong with wanting people to see you/. anyway/. I look at all these people and I criticize them all the time I even criticize scott and I wish I didn't because then I think life would be much easier to live in I don't think anyone's as negative as I am Has it been twenty minutes yet? Oh I have ten left. I wish I could get in side the teacher's but then would I really like what I see. sounding like a theater major again and the roses are blooming outside but they'll be dead soon because they are so lovey all the flowers I have die it seems. I got to get out of this place but then where will you go You want to go to another body but you know the problems will be just as frightening there PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME what happened to you all? How come I never was on your crowd? How come you never thought I was cool enough to include in your circle? To respect? To invite? You know I think I would have stopped being so goddamn nice if you had invited me not made me feel like I had to try so hard to be your friend but I don't understand why I had to try so hard? What was wrong with me? I guess it was just sitting down with you all. I couldn't think of anything to say to you and now I can't think of anything to say to anyone? Does that mean they all think of me the same way? Am I doomed to be uncool forever/ Will I ever have that group of friends that I love to watch from afar? I keep trying and trying. I wonder what I would have possibly have done to be happier at SmU? I wanted to be their center of attention. I think I could have handled it if boys hit on me,. but they never did you know. I think I could have handled it if they had come up to me and said hey. you know were going to a movie tonight do you want to come? We really want you too,. I really want you too. And have it not be on a school night for God's sake. I mean that was half my problem I never went to anyone's house on a school night. I wanted to study. Was that so bad? And I guess I just felt very intimidated when I went over there because all I could really do was watch. I could never really join in because they didn't think it was worth listening to ? Or was it my fault because I just didn't try? Now I'm here and I don't feel any different at the coop except at this point I really don't care if they accept me or not because I have tons of more important things to do. I have my time school you know School take up like PROPNAME's work and your theater and everything. , ORGNAME is my life now,. ,. my best friend I guess. What is a best friend anyway? Everyone has their faults I guess a best friend is someone oh times up. 
__label__label1 Well after Labor Day weekend I had come to the conclusion that I disliked the college life. Everything had gone so wrong that weekend. The book store sent me home with the wrong book, I didn't have my "IF" account so I couldn't check my email, and I bought a twenty dollar calling card that is supposed to be better than the one I had been buying and it was a rip off. The tendollar card had more minutes on it than than the twentydollar card, and to top that off the darn thing only had sixteen dollars on it. So my weekend was just a bunch of carp. I am not exactly home sick, but I do miss my baby brother and my fiancé. I went home this past weekend, missed the first football game here, and saw the two people I missed most. It was so cool to be home everybody was so happy to see me, it was great. I am planning on joining a sorority here to keep me busy so I won't get home sick. I haven't really met anyone here yet. The girls on my floor aren't very friendly. When I first got here I was bored out of my mind, but now things are looking better. I am not real in to Sixth Street, but the first week I was here some friends that live here took me there. I got my tattoo on Sixth Street when we were here for orientation. I keep saying we, my best friend and I that is. My best friend is my roommate and she is trying to get me to enjoy it here and not miss home too much. I have to say I do like the fact that my parents can't tell me what to do, and when to be home and all the other things that parents tell their kids to do. I was ready to get away and be on my own. My fiancé is at home going to school there. Hopefully he will come up here next year. We are supposed to get married this summer, but I guess we will have to see what happens. It is so weird to see everyone outside smoking in the middle of the night, and to see people going out at three in the morning. At home we have a curfew, and they are real strict about it too. Other than all that stuff, I am adjusting pretty well to the college life and am learning to love it. Things can only get better, right. I know I made it sound like I just hate it here, but I don't. The weekend at home was enough to hold me off for awhile. That one bad weekend made me think that it was always going to be like that. Next time I will be writing about how much I love it here, and I won' t have anything to complain about. 
__label__label0 How do you know when you can really know what another person feels. How do I learn to trust what people say to me. It's hard for me to be in a relationship when I can't see that person everyday. I know that I am the kind of person that would never want to cause any pain, yet I see people who are in relationships for such wrong reasons. My friend was telling me that she is dating this guy yet already has plans on leaving him for something better. I don't understand why people can be so selfish to where they don't think of other peoples feelings. I am in a very intense relationship right now. I love my boyfriend with all my heart. Having a long distance relationship is very hard to deal with when you are the type of person who needs that comfort of a companion. I know how I feel for him and I think I know what he feels for me to, yet in a world where people can be so deceitful, I find it still possible that I can be the one being used in a relationship. I guess you must do what your heart tells you to because love is a risk. I believe it is worth taking. When you love someone, you have this vulnerable feeling towards them. I don't want to walk blindly into a relationship, being overwhelmed by the feeling of love but I would want to see how the flow goes. I want to learn how to be a good companion. I hope someday to make a really good wife. I find it important to marry your best friend. I can't wait until I figure out what life has in store for me. I want to do so many things and right now I feel so limited. I just hope that no matter what happens with my relationship now I can keep a friendship. I believe that the first love of your life will never die, and true love lives in you forever. I can never imagine not loving him anymore. I don't want to be person that is dependent on someone else but I do think that it is good to have someone to run to when things do always go right. Sometimes I feel like I don't know what to say when he runs to me with difficulties in his life. He always seems to know what to say to make me smile. When he told me about his cousin in the hospital and how he figured the funeral would be coming soon, I had no idea what to say. I didn't know what to tell him other than the only thing we can do is pray for him. I believe that that is all we have when we come to situations like that. I just wish I could talk to him and be able to be more comforting. I have to feel like I am bringing him a sense of comfort in this relationship. I love him so much and I don't want him to suffer any pain. It is just so hard not being able to physically be there for him because just the comfort of having someone at your side, can help you get through rough times. When I do see him I will hopefully know what to say when that moment comes. I find that ever chance that we do get to see each other I try to absorb the feeling of his presence. I try to remember his scent and the way his lips feel against mine. It's so hard to let go of him. I just want to try to treasure that moment so that it can get me through another week. I miss hearing his voice even though we talked just a day ago. So how do I do this going maybe four years of living in another city. My life right now is perfectly the way that I have always planned and dreamed, except for living away from him. I know that I am not in a place to compromise. I can't compromise my education. I have always dreamed of going to this university and now that I am here, I wouldn't dream of letting this go. Yet my problem is that I don't know that I could ask him to give up what he is doing, because I love him and I know that he loves what he does. Yes, it is possible that he could move to LOCNAME, considering there are jobs available to him, but I wouldn't want him to make that decision because of me. I would want him to have more than me to move. So we just seem to take it day by day, but I can't help but ask "Where are we going to be next semester, next year or after I graduate?" my question must wait until the time happens. I have to just learn to have patience and see where destiny takes me. I will become stronger through all of this. I hope to learn selfconfidence and to be more dependent. I know that I have many good things to bring out to people and someday I will know who the person is that deserves my love and affection. Maybe I know it now but in time I will find out whether I am right or not 
__label__label0 After I finish this paper I'm going to go work out, then get something to eat at LOCNAME LOCNAME. I need to get back in shape. I feel better. Then I'll finish reading from my Zen book and economics book. I hope I am not taking the same economics class I did last year at CCCC. That is going to be a big waste if it is. I can't wait to go home on Friday to see my friends and family. It's not all what is cracked up to be down here. LOCNAME is so much better. It bigger, better stuff to do. I just like that environment. It's ok down here. I really have not met many people. Just my roommate and a few in my dorm. Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I met a very friendly and pretty girl named PROPNAME today. She lives in 000 of the Towers. She told me to come by. I'm debating on going over there or not. I'm sure PROPNAME wouldn't like it. Obviously since we are not doing so good right now. I just don't know what to do with her. I feel like if I break up with her it is going to be a mistake. I don't know what I feel. I'm lost. I don't feel like I have the freedom to do what I want to do. Sometimes I just feel like I'm better of with out her. She would be crushed if I broke up with her since it would be like the 00th time. I feel like there is just something else out there better for me, but I never tell her that. The sight of seeing her hurt and crying makes me feel so guilty and sad. I feel so sorry for her. I lie to her all the time about my true feelings because they are so mixed right now. I feel like I'll be lost with out her, but that might be just because I was with her for so long. I am getting pretty hungry right now, but I need to work out first. There are a lot of fine girls that work out. Sometimes I wish I could hook up with one of them. Tomorrow night might be fun. I only have one class, thank god. I hate Tuesday's and Thursday's. Three classes from 000 is forever. Actually I just hate my Cal class. I can't stand sitting in those chairs they are so uncomfortable. Just two more days until I leave. I 'm getting pretty anxious about it. I can't sleep very much at night. I don't fall asleep until 0 or 0. Then I wake up very tired. I can't wait to back to sleep after classes. But then I feel like I'm pressured for time. If I sleep it takes away the time I have to study, therefore taking away my free time. So its either nap, or play. I hope my tests aren't difficult at least after I have studied well. I have this horrible fear that I am not going to do good and fail out. That is the last thing I want to happen. 
__label__label1 It is 0:00 and I have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. I can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that I am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that I will only be graded for the fact that I did it and not examined for the content of my mind. Does everyone hold their mind as sacred? I can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way I guess I am somewhat obsessive/compulsive. It's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. This openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do I have to say? This 00 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who I am sometimes I think that's what life is about  everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet I wish I had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. Who doesn't want to be analyzed? Who doesn't want to analyze? I know that I am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, "voyeurs". I had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. My friends considered themselves "voyeurs" and I had to admit that I am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions I only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. It strikes me as funny that I am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that I am talking to you to the extent that I can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? I was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. I thought again about how different I feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and I feel like I've written a lot. If I were a TA I would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as I read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and I would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. But perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are "true to science" YAY! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. I am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet I cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? It has certainly given people (I've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. I don't discount science, I do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. It's a tough tough thing. Of course 00% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous I can imagine. But as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? I have been asking a lot of questions! How defining of me! Now I (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. I will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 0 minutes actually the time will be up. Well love and life and craziness and all the things I thought I would end up saying are not surfacing here, although I think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? I think I remember once reading about oh shit I lost my train of thought oh yeah, I think it might have been PROPNAME PROPNAME (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. Those few seconds that you pause when someone says "mother" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha HA! PROPNAME time's up. This has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words I was using. Thank you very much. 
__label__label1      my name is david i am 00 years old and i love to work out and talk to girls i don't know why i love girls so much i like girls who are tanned athletic and have nice breasts.

I really don't know what would happen like would she really kiss me back, shes got a good heart i don't know if she would feel comfortable kissing a cheating boyfriend. I've never cheated even though it would be easy for me somehow my girlfriend would find out i know it. i really want to play video games right now. if video games and girls didnt exist i probably would already be a doctor. I am extremely smart well not extremely but i am capable of handling anything i think. i get pissed off so easily if people call me dumb which im not. i don't dress up at all here and i still look good i wish i didnt have acne i swear if i was in a stupid frat i would be swimming in women, why do girls liek frat guys those guys are thick headed they wouldnt be able to maintain a healthy relationship if i pointed a gun to their heads, everyone in austin drives horribly. I swear its almost as if they want to run pedestrians over each time i walk home. fuck them i would have no remorse killing anyone running me over or even try a sad attempt to kill me. i feel im going to be around for a long time. i hope god will always forgive me for things i do, i love god its just hard to include him in my life all the time. my girlfriend just called me she almost told my brother she had period god that would been awful thank god. i hate cell phones they hurt my head oh now its breaking up whata  surprise. my girlfriend  always calls at bad times i find myself rarely needing to talk to her all it end up is doing something i  don't want to do. ugh shut up tracy i don't care go  jamba juice  soudns good right now. i hope punctuation doesnt matter  my computer is so old. thursday night at club 000 was such a waste of time, i saw stupid mexican trash pissing on an escalade i hate mexican trash i feel fine openly saying this because guess what im one of them except i actually have whiter skin and better manners and a brain. i am the best damn latin man out there if only more girls knew, if only i knew spanish.

__label__label0      So, it's a Tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. I ate dinner earlier and can   feel the food digesting. I am rather anxious about something. Not terribly that it is   distracting, but I feel as though I am expecting something. It might be that I am   nervous about school. It's a new place for me, coming from LOCNAME. I haven't   really made my close group of friends. Sure, I've been having loads of fun, but I   still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. I haven't found my niche.   It's almost like I am waiting for it to be a month from now when I've found my place.   It's also hard in class, becuase I don't know many, hardly any at all, people in   them. I don't have people where I can go to work on projects or anything. This   makes me a little worried about how I am going to do, becuase I can't compare   answers on homework with friends, and I can't discuss new concepts with anyone.   I think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more   stressful than I originally expected. But I am not worried because there are so   many people here that I know it can't be too long before I find my place. Austin is a   great city also. That's a definite plus. The city has just a great atmosphere. I've   seen two concerts here and I love it. I can't wait to see even more of the city and   it's cool places. Music is a big part of my life and I think that is really going to make   me happy. It's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or   something I will love to do. I am really excited to get to know some of the local   musicians. That'll be cool. I also have feelings that I want to have a girlfriend. I don't really know what I want   sexually. I feel like I want a steady girlfriend. Someone who I can always be close   with. I really think that will help make my transition into LOCNAME easier. But it's hard   for me to find someone who I'll get along with this well. Another thing I think about   is committment. I dont' know if I want a long term relationship. Also, would it be to   distracting for be because of school?  I certainly know that school is my priority, but   now that I'm in college, I have to discover how much time I really need to spend   doing work to maintain my ORGNAME. I think that the first semester is the hardest   because it's a new atmosphere and I have to test the limits and such.   Another thing that kind of worries me is my suitemate. He is a big partier, and   although I like to party some, he's always up very late at night and is usually very   loud. It's hard for me to tell whether it will last or if it's just the first week of school   and he's really excited. I just hope that he will get to studying. I am sur that all will   work out. I really feel that things usually do work out, and eventually I will feel   hapiness and the anxious feeling will go away. I'm just anxious to not be anxious   anymore. 
__label__label0   o. k try not to think. just let all your thoughts come together. this is not as easy as i thought it was going to be. the guy next door is still playing that crappie music. i wish i could go one day without hearing that, but i think it's ok my roommate just walked in and started to talk to me so i lost my train of thought. alright he left. i'm glad mary, his girlfriend, is going home. i hope they don't walk back in here and see what i just wrote but is suck last night hearing them makeout when i was trying to sleep. but she's cool. my hands are getting tried of typing. i don't know if i can make it the whole 00 min. now he's playing a new song but he turned it off. thank god. we need to clean up, this place is nasty. i don't know if i going to be able to get eric to clean. the bathroom is nasty. im run out of things to say and write. eric has some gay sunglass. i hope he doesnt wear them around me. i hope i just didnt offend my teacher or who ever reads this by saying gay. i hope my teacher doesnt think now i think he's gay, not that there's anything wrong with that. thats like that episode of Sinfied. i don't think i spelled that right. i don't have time to change it. just 0 more minutes. i didnt write that much. i hope i still get i good grade, im just i slow typer. time is almost up i need something to do after this. ill call dan well maybe not i don't want him to think i have no other friends    
__label__label0      You know, I just don't know how to schedual my workouts and PROPNAME PROPNAME Do sessions. I think that four workout days and three tae kwon do days in a week sound pretty good. I could do chest, tris, and shoulders on Sunday, PROPNAME PROPNAME do on Monday, quads and hams on Tuesday, Tae Kwon Do on Wednesday, back and bis on Thursdays, Tae Kwon Do on Fridays, Calves and inner, outer and glutes on Saturday. I like that schedual because my time is not fully committed to one area of interest. I used to work out every day of the week. I also can't do that anymore because my interests in the martial arts prohibit me from emulating PROPNAME PROPNAME. The German Giant! That guy is swool. I think that's how you speel swool. As in it's swoolen. Hum, maybe it's swolen. Whatever, who cares? An English teacher ya but on stream of consiousness? Besides, what if my consiousness doesn't want me to spell it right. Maybe my mind is secretly liberal and is telling me to go against the 'establishment'. 'Damn the Man' and 'down with big brother'  and all of that. Maybe it's my secret way of avoiding conformity. That all sounds like bullshit to me but who can say otherwise besides me. I guess everyone now that I've said it's b. s. but that's not the point. The point is, of this tiny fragment of thought anyway, is that I could basically come up withany excuse I wanted to explain my actions and no one could say otherwise. Why can't you go up on the 'stand' and declare yourself that you were insane at the time of the murder. I mean, expertise and all that junk doesn't insure that from one, or maybe even no meeting at all, meeting a psychologist can determine that the accused was insane at the time of the crime. Does it really even make it more likely? Lets say that my mom was killed. I'd be pretty pissed and I'd break things and fight and all that fun stuff but would I classify myself as insane at the time? No, to myself anyway. If it could get me out of trouble ya, but I would know that I was really just pissed off and sad and all like that. But whatever, how can I talk about this? I have no credentials. Which brings up another point, why do you need credentials? Why do people always quote other people in research papers. I'm mostly talking about philosophy papers and diplomatic position papers. Why quote PROPNAME, was he so enormously intellegent that all your oqn thoughts are irrelevent? Why not write a paper about what you think? Maybe you have read some of PROPNAME's writing, then perhaps you should discuss your thoughts on that but why form an opinion entirely off what other people have said? What does that make you?  A follower, a person who does nothing but agrees. Whats that all about? How could anyone live just agreeing. It really does annoy me though, how people, some people, just quote other people. It's like you can't be wrong if you go with what some dead guy said. I say go with what you say. What's wrong with that. I'm going to make it a point to quote myself int he next paper I write fro psychology. I know that writing a position paper on an issue is your opinion but is it really YOUR opinion if you've already read what someone else has to say. I'd like to do nothing but read purely data filled reports and form my own opinions on what is going on. I also refuse to validate my position by incorporating a quote from a famous dead guy, or an alive one. What I say has importance because I am intelligent. 
__label__label1 i wonder if kyle will call. he lies all the time kyle listening to music reminds me about kyle, about our relationship about how good it was, he used to be so sweet, kissing me and i know that he really did love me at one time, why has everything changed, why does he still tell me he loves me but acts mean to me, i hate that he tells me i shoudldnt go out and party and have fun because he does it too, he gets involved with others while i just window shop at guys, im just not attracted to some of the gusy here, they are morons, they have money stuck on their minds along with sex. i don't feel pretty enough for some of the nice guys that i do meet, i have gained sooo much weight in the last two years, fat. i feel so fat, i can't wear anything anymore because it looks so terrible, i used to feel pretty and normal back home where i everyone seemed to love me, I've been so homesick, i miss my granny and janie and kyles family. i worry about tara back home, if shes making the right decisions if she really will go to college, i at least want her to go to kc i don't want her to end up like everyone else in kilgore, they end up working at some department store making minimum wage and haveing five babies and getting on food stamps. shes better than that. i love her and want her to not end up my mom. i hate my mother. she has to be the worst person ever to just leave me behind, to leave me like i don't matter, to not come to my graduation, to not try to see me to leave me for a man that she doesnt love. she was so wrong to my dad. i wish she would go to prison and i hate her so much. i can't be like her i can't end up like her. i will never hurt my children when im a mom. i will be a good mother. a mom who plays tea party and who devotes her life to them. they will be my world. i wonder if ill marry kyle, i wonder if he will be the father of my children. i hate not knowing how he feels. he pisses me off. he says he loves me and at time i really think he does but then  he treats me like shit too. i wish i could say no to him but it always seems so impossible. i love him. everything reminds me of him. every conversation i have involves his name everything i hear or see reminds me of the good times we had. we were in love. a guy just doesnt do the stupid things he does. but then why did he have to reverse all that. why did he date that trish when he left to go to college, we were together and he dated her and i really don't trust him. hes nothing but a big mystery to me. what is it about him, what is missing that i don't know about. i feel like hes hiding something really really bad from me. he used to scare me when he said hes involved in the mafia. i believe him some of the time. its weird how everything he says is right. hes so weird. kyle is reallly really weird. i want to go see him. i want him to take me to a football game. i wonder why he liked me. i was five years younger than him. a baby compared to him. he never had a girlfriend until me. not a serious one anyway, just girls that he played and used. what made him fall in love with me. what makes him have control over me. i let him. everythihng he does is my fault becuase i let him do it. i let hime make me feel bad but i don't know how to get away from that. i feel like hes the only person in this world that knows everything about me. everything and hes the only one that understands everything i do and have been through. i miss him. i hate him too. i really want to cry this music im listening to is so damn depressing. bryan adams. romantic music. this reminds me of back home. i miss kilgore, i hated it when i left and now i miss it. its small but a good town. im ready to go to homecoming. i wonder if ill have any attention. i used to remember the college kids coming hnome for the first time and how cool it was. i wonder if people will be happy to see me. i wonder if they will think i look different. freshman fifteen surely not in a month. its alcohol. i think i drink too much. i miss riding by myslef with a case on the backroads back in kilgore. those were the days. 
__label__label1      Well here i am writing this assignment don't know exactly what to make of it but i will give it a try. College has definetly been a weird expierience so far frat life is very different than what i was used to back in my home town. My friends are acting very differently even friends i knew close in high school are pretending like the don't know me and its strange. don't get me wrong i have nothing against branching out and meeting new people but i still like to keep in touch with my friends but i can't seem to do that. Huge decisions permeate my life right now, i mean people keep telling me that the decisions i make over the next couple of years are going to affect me but it seems like the decisions i make right now affect me the most. Whether i join a christian fraternity or not its all so strange. People are often so complex and strange. I guess thats why i am a Psychology major. The mind is so complex and even today hasnt been mastered. For example how do i know if what i am typing here right now is my actual real thoughts and not something i think abuot thinking merely for this expieriement.  What is real. . if it is just electrical impluses interpreted by the brain then what is real   - Morpheus. Just thought i would throw that in there. don't get me wrong i know in my heart the foundation of my life but already in the first chapter of this book i have beef with this writer. He explains coincidences in our lives as totally unrelated and people use extra ordinary beliefs in superstition or God to explain them. I don't believe that at all how is PROPNAME PROPNAME so sure he knows what a coincidence is anyways? Too me it seems there are too many coincidences in modern day life that they lose their   coincidentibility   and some greater power has to be in control. I willingly get up every day knowing without a doubt that The Creator of the Universe has sacrificed himself for me and i can't tell you how great a feeling taht is. Knowing that no matter what mistakes i make during the day His blood will cover me. Evolution is a big tub of crap. How can something come from nothing. . its impossible defies the system of physics? Even if one buys into the Big Bang Theory which is a load of crap where did that first star come from? SOMETHING CANNOT COME FROM NOTHING. . and the way that things are spiralling downward the farther and farther we push God out of the picture. The more we take Him out of the Pledge of LOCNAME and our money the further we dig ourselves until He comes back like a   theif in night   and to be honest i can't wait.  For the wisdom of man is the foolishness of GOD   so the smartest man on our is a fool compared to Gods infinite wisdom. I guess PROPNAME just encompasses my life which is why I must place Him in this paper. I know Psychology is where God wants me but I watch guard to be sure taht human s don't think they know everything heck even PROPNAME had some akward ideas about sexual behavior in children people are human God is not that is simple. This 00 minutes is actually very long how can i sit and write this long. WHy am  i listening to 000 right now i mean i got the song yesterday but i didnt think i liked them but i guess they make some good music. These shorts from ORGNAME are the bomb  they only cost 0 dollars. . they are plaid. PROPNAME keeps talkin to me and interupting me and hes whacked up. . he is the most judgemental person i have ever met he thinks he can predict the future and it really makes me mad. Hes so certain and hes so wrong and it blows. I did laundry today and it didnt take long but i didnt take anythign with me so it just seemed like forever  You know what is the worst thing ever when girls come to your apartment and steal your dvd's without asking taht is about the worst thing ever. I am kind neat like that and i like to account for all my DVDs and when they are taken without me knowing i like freak out. I wonder how many college guys look at pornography. . i bet its allot. i wonder if girls look at porno probably not but ya never know. Why would yo go to ORGNAME i mean its a terrible school. PROPNAME time is running out so i guess this is winding down but i hope i gave some insight and hope everything turns out well 
__label__label1 tomorrow we're going to see carrie, i'm really excited, i think but then there's also being anxious about it. i know i should be happy and in many ways i am, it's just weird. because i mean things with lisa have been on the weird side lately adn i don't think it's going to get any easier. maybe it's only this period of transition. i'm glad that lisa's comign out of her shell, i guess i'm still not wanting to. but then thea'ts not really something i like doing. typing on the keyboards makes little to no sense. at least with eva's keyboard, it's letters are separated, i wonder how she writes like that. i hate my dingy old omsputer though its so crappy i wish i could get s\a new one, but theen it'd be bad wasting it on some money. i wonder who that professors in waking life was. matthew said he teaches at LOCNAME but i guess it'd be hard to find him. there are al million billion people on campus. which has been weird cause i've been seeing people that i didn't really think i'd see again. i don't quite know what to do about that. i wish that john and i were better friends so we could hang out somewhere away from here and everything in my life wouldn't be so complicated and connected for once. i wonder what he thingsk of me, i hope i'm not imposing too much, i gues its been a while since there has been someone that's really interested me and i wish i could make him be interestedd in me too. i think its that need for love that we all have that makes me get this way. i guess i'd feel much better if i had someone that could hold my hand and listen to everything. i wish on some level i could be taht way with matthew, but when i'm with him, its so much more different. oh god. i'm only been writing for 0 minutes? what am i supposeed to write about. i wonder if this will give me writer  s cramps. that carpal tunnel ? syndrome. i doubt it. but i don't know this is probly the most work i've had to do for a class so far. that and going to cnetral market, which wasn't too bad. i don't see all the glamour of central market yet, but who knows maybe it's there. i'm glad that i know some people in my classes, at least in my art related classes. theatre and psychology are other things. i wnat to be able to go up and talk to someone, but its so freaking intimidating. i think i'll make it a point next time to come early so i can get a good seat. i just wish i wasn't so tired all the time so i could really enjoy those classes. i thought i'd be spending alot more time being intellectually stimulated than i have been since classes startedd. maybe it just takes aw hile. i dunno, i still miss some aspects of high school. god, that sounds lame. and i know it is on most levels, i just miss how easy it was. but maybe not. the latter part of high school was hell. especially senior year. and really before senior year. i can't believe i still think about him sometimes. i must be liek the biggest loser in the world. i wonder if its because of him that i'm still get malfunctioney sometimes. but most days, i know for sure that's not true. maybe i just need someone or something to constantly be thinking about. like i need some drama in my life so i create it for myself by bringing up something that really bothered me even though its way in the past. i can't spend all this time and energy trying to analyze myself. it gets exhausting. i just should forget about it sometimes and just have funn. but then that gets you to be too so-called   shallor  . . that's really lame. i should just not be this way. i don't know. its not like i really think this way all the time. maybe i do but i guess it just seems different when actually writing out ideas as they come. i guess thats what i did with paper journal. thought i've become too lazy to keep up with one. i wonder how anna is doing. i'm glad she keeps in touch with carrie at least. in my aspect i totally understand why she wouldn't make too great of an effort to talk to me. god, i'm such an ass sometimes. hmm. . maybe i should eat ramen. it was so good today. but i dunno, that would mean i got to go work out or something and i know i'll regret it later. i'm tired of worrying about weight but then the flabbiness is not good to look at. i wonder how really obese peopel can live. i mean, not to be rude, but i feel really bad for them. if i were in their position and had trouble with just like moving around and stuff i might just die. aimee is going to sleep and this static crap is annoying the shit oputta me. i guess that's that whole buyy cheap. less quality thing. god but now its' like louder than ever. there headphones off muuuuuch better. my computer is so stupid. makes too much noise. i want to meet john someday. i hope he writes back soon. i guess i was kind of a big jerk for waiting so long to write to hiom. gosh, i hate that. it could have been fixed and we could be writing each other back and forth like we used to. . but noo. . i'm a big freaking idiot. ahh maybe i shouldn't try so hard. he's different than most guuys i know, i think. and i dunno, i really would like to see him one day. at least as friends, even though that might be kind of big and scary. maybe we'll just keep corresponding through email. that would be enough to keep me happy. i think. it's just weird giving so much of yourself so honestly and candidly and without prided or shame to someone you have never seen in real life. though, la 
__label__label1     I am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. Although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, I'm still going to think as I write this intro. You see, it's my birthday today, and so I could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. I'm taking a girl I like to a party tonight - I guess that might be more interesting. Or maybe I should just talk about how my parents really piss me off.          Since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. But before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. They would bitch about anything, seriously. I mean, I had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. My friend PROPNAME once told me I should get in a lot of trouble. Then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. For some reason I never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. But, he was right. When they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year.        Okay, new topic. When I was over at my friend PROPNAME's house one day, this kid pulls out PROPNAME's . 00 rifle. I'm like,   Dude, don't point that at me, turn it away.   He listens, and he starts pointing it at PROPNAME. PROPNAME is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. This kid is pointing the rifle at PROPNAME, making shooting noises, while PROPNAME is playing a ORGNAME game. For some reason, I had a really bad feeling. This was not a toy - it was a gun. POP!  All of a sudden it went off. The thing was, the kid was at such close range, Alex couldn't even feel the blast. I had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. I ran to call the ambulance, and I think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. Anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), I've never liked guns.          My phone's ringing right now, but I'm not going to pick it up since I'm doing this assignment. You know, I bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. That's so boring. I like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. Looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. I'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. But thanks for listening and I'll catch you on the flip side.        
__label__label1 When I first heard about our first writing assignment, I figured it would be very difficult because I am used to writing about a specified subject matter. But hopefully I can take up these 00 minutes by talking my day or how I feel. Actually, I think I'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. It was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that I might feel or think. I also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. Well, I don't have much of either (self-esteem/ self-confidence). Hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in LOCNAME I will develop these traits. When I first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. I almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' I mean, I knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, I was not able to do it. For example, I hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! So I naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because I wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. But I quickly learned here, that YOU have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. In fact, the question I probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. So I think I have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. In addition, I would always do everything with my friends. And upon coming to PROPNAME, I feel/felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. Usually, I'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. So these past few weeks, I did not let myself do that. I very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. This was very rewarding, in that, I don't feel as lost in such a big university, and I'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. This is a characteristic which I will need for my expected major. I'm still not too keen on what exactly I want to do because when I think about it, I want to do/be everything, but when I think about it again I don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! But I think I'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. I'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down THAT much. But I still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. I don't know if I should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. Because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. So I'm really confused about that. Hopefully, I will learn more about myself through my college journey at LOCNAME.         
__label__label1 I have never been asked to do anything like this before. It is actually hard to think of anything to think about when you are asked to. This class seems as though it is going to be very interesting. Many people act in strange ways. Maybe this class will help me better understand that. I have a friend that acts in strange ways. Well, actually he use to be my boyfriend. It is so intersting to sit back and watch how he reacts to different things. He sometimes is so hateful and so mean to people for no reason. He has said so many mean things to me and the next day he is sorry for acting the way he did. But the funny thing is, he always ends up doing it again. My dad is somewhat the same way. But he seems more like he has a split personality. It is sometimes very scary. He can just snap sometimes and be a totally different person then he really is. Most of the time it is for no apparent reason. Maybe him being a heavy drinker has something to do with it. I also have a friend that doesn't know how to deal with her emotions too well. She goes literally crazy sometimes. One time I didn't answer my cell phone, and she left the most hateful voice mail. If you would have heard it, you would have thought she was crazy too. But when i confront her about it, she says sorry and can't explain why she did it. I seem to always be stuck in the middle of everything. No matter who is involved or what the situation is, my name always some how pops up. It is pretty aggrivating actually. And I have always lived my life to my dads standards. I never really get to worry about pleasing myself, because i always have to worry about pleasing my dad. My dad wanted me to be a cheerleader. So of course i worked my butt off to become one. He also wanted me to get in to UT. Don't get me wrong, i love it here. But the more i do want he wants the more he ask of me. None of his other children are asked to live up to his standards. 
__label__label0      Im tired and i need to wake up tomorrow for my eight o' clock class. . i should probably go to bed. My roomate is already in bed i swear thats all he does i come home from class, he's asleep, i wake up he's asleep. I need to clean my room up, there is a bunch of crap in here. i need to do dishes and laundry and clean up my floor. i wish i were playing racquetball. . but i can't get a court they are all full. . why is racquetball so popular here. ?  I need to go shopping too. i need more gatorade and some more coke. and maybe some more candybars. . i think ill get a coffee maker. . can i have one here or is it against   fire codes    i need a shower too. . im thirsty. . nice cold coke. man i don't know if i can write for 00 minutes straight. man . . eight o' clock. . thats funy. . my roomates car smells horrible. hehe. . aint no mountain high enough, aint no river low enough. i wonder why vilmar was listening to that, i can't wait till this weekend goin to fort worth, i should call creig, i need to do that, see what he's up to and go visit him. i need to order that light for my computer too. i wonder whats on tv, i wonder if the simpsons are on. . maybe ill find out. i wonder why i havent found a girl up here yet, there are thousands here but i can't seem to talk to one of them i just need to walk up to them and be like, hey, whats up. . i don't know though, some of them look snobby. . oh well. . i wonder if im supposed to have the music on or not during this, this is kind of interesting just to type for twenty minutes. i wish this cold would go away, I've been sick forever. what if the phone were to ring would i answer it or what??  ill go take a shower after this. i remember high school, it was fun but im still glad i graduated early. . move on to bigger and better things, i just hope my parents are proud of me. i bet they miss me, i miss them too but not too much, they are only an hour away. . my dog is the one i really miss, i saw a seeing eye dog earlier and was like, i miss my dog, hes awsome, he helped me through some stuff. . why did candice accuse me of breaking andrews windshield, thats not cool i wasnt even there. . oh well, not my problem, he deserved it though he wasnt being cool to britney, whatever, hey she just got online, cool. ill talk to her later. . i still got nine minutes to type. twenty minutes is really a long time, classes seem short here compared to high school even though they are the same length. . thats a good thing though. man im tired, seven minutes, i need a shower, i wonder whats wrong with vilmars computer, i bet i can fix it if i get a chance, i bet its just installed wrong or something, but thats cool, ill see what i can do, this song sucks, change it. . god im tired, been up too long, need sleep, i wonder where jorge went, he took his calculus book and left, i bet he went to go study with raj, yeah. man candice is pissing me off, she thinks i did it, thats messed up, i wasnt even there. whatever   
__label__label1     I know this guy that lies. When I met him, he lies about himself to fit in. Being the gullible person that I am, I believed all of his lies. After all, they're not that absurd--maybe they are. He said he worked at Best Buy when he was fourteen and had a cell phone. He said he was the on call technical support personnel. PROPNAME PROPNAME and I still teases him about that. I guess because of that, I didn't believe he got a new car when he actually did. His car is quite a looker. I wish my car is like that. It just needs a lot of work. Perhaps more money is needed than work. I need to work to get money. I have no idea when or where should I be working. I think the work load of ORGNAME is enough to stress me out without working. If I work, then my free time will be taken away from me. I really cherish my free time; I could work out at the gym or play video games. Something I never had free time to do. Well I also have to read a lot of materials for my classes. Today is September the 00th--one week from my birthday. I hate my birthday. Bad luck always happen on that day. on my 00th birthday I got my first speeding ticket. Three days later, I wrecked my car totally. September of 0000 was the worst month of my life. I guess I always expect to be happy on my birthday since it's supposed to be a good day. Maybe that's why it seemed even worse when everything wasn't going my way. I love my friends. They're people who really care about me and my life. I do the same for them. I, however, do have a problem with keeping girls as just friends. In my opinion, friends of the opposite sex who don't really care about your life are just as bad as some person you had a small talk in the elevator. The only reason I have those so-called friends is because they're my buddies' friends. We belonged in a clique, a group, if you will, back in high school. I don't like the idea of a   group  . Maybe things will change as life goes on. My roommate, PROPNAME, and I were best friends in high school. We are roommates for almost a month now, and we haven't made each other mad. I guess that's a good sign. I heard about stories about sour relationships over something stupid. I have a mello personality. I can compromise.      
__label__label0      Well it is about 0:00 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. I keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. I guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. I almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying   hey you should be studying something!   ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. The joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a   B   or   C   on a test rather than an   A  . I like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. So because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. Right now my grades are very important to me. I feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. Where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. My success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. Understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. You must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. Right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. So in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in Business. My happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 00 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. It makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. Ha. . what a character. Well no not really just a determined man. I like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. When i moved here from LOCNAME i had an agenda and for the last 0 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. It gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. Blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . Feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. I see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. Man i need to get some sleep. I took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   T  . Many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 0/00. Wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. Which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. The doctors say that she does not feel a thing. I really would like to believe them. It seems unfair that she should live this long (00 years) only to be let to die a little every day. The doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. I miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. Bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? It seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. Trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. I have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. Maybe that is part of this writing experiment. Have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. So when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. The mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. I read somewheres that in a thousand years the English language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. So they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. Hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the Egyptians. . times up. . night. 
__label__label1      Why I'm I here typing when i could have gone and eat? When   does my next class start? I hope my mom left me some food for   tonight. I got to call my friend to go work out. My stomache is   growling. That girl over there look so cute, i want to go up to her and   introduces me, but i'm scared. Maybe i'll have the gut next time. I   can't wait for this week to be over with, but I'm not ready for the exam   next week. what do i have to do for tonight?  Do i have to pick up my   brother today from football? What time is my fraternity interview. I   hope i get accepted. What's the guy next to me is doing? This writing   assignment is so long!  I don't know what else to write. Oh,   tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the terrorist attack on the   world trade center. What i would do to stop terrorism and PROPNAME PROPNAME.  I can't wait for the fall semester to be over with so i could go to   LOCNAME and visits my cousins and relatives. I missed them so   much. I'm so exhausted from weight training class. I'm so tired.  What worse is I have to walk all the way from PROPNAME PROPNAME to the   Union going up so many steps. I walked so much. Why does all my   classes have to be so far apart? Ten minutes left. hahaha. When   does the fall semester offically end? Hmmm. . Another pretty girl   just walks in. Of all the student at LOCNAME, how come i only a couple of   cute girl? Why is that? I'm i in the wrong building or at the wrong   place or something? Where is all the pretty girl at? Oh. the cheddar   lover combo from ORGNAME's sound so terribly good right now! I can't   wait for this assignment to be over with and go get one from the   Union. I wish i have some kind of super power sometimes. Maybe   the power to go to the future, be back in time, super strenth, be   invisible, shape shifter, be able to fly or have super power eye sight. I   wish i have all of those, hehehehehe. Hmmm. three minutes left,   what else i'm i thinking. This assignment doesn't seem so bad after   all. I wish all the assignments is like this!  My body are so sore. I'm   gonning to go to sleep once i get out of class today. Man, i got a lab   to do right after class!! That suck. Oh well, got to go. 
__label__label0 I really don't know which house I liked best. The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 0-0 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if PROPNAME and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 00 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 0. 0 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 0. 0 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope PROPNAME is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 0 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. PROPNAME was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 0 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. PROPNAME said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. PROPNAME just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 0 minute to go. . nice. PROPNAME got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0 bye  
__label__label1      I really don't konow waht to write about and I have already   misspelled like a lot of words because i am a horrible typer. Man i   type slow. I havent done anything all day adnd it has been quite   great. I was in this exer experiment and a it was totally boring. It was   called I'm on fire , but it had nothing to do with fire. I sat in a little   room. You know for days I have been thinking to myself about e what   I was going to write on my paper and actually it is a lot easier than i   thought. We read PROPNAME senior year and we had to write in the   stream of con science so that is why I am not correcting my   mistakes because she won't let us . She said it would stop our train   of thought. The people next to us have to loudest music. I am in my   room adnd I can totally hear the music perfectly. Good thing that they   listen to music I like. Twenty minutes is actually a real long time   because I have been typing for awhile and it is like only 0 minutes in   to the thing. I think I miss hiome. I am from a small town and LOCNAME   is huge. It is different a,and I do like it. I get sick of people asking me   though.  Do you like it here  ! I mean I have only been living here for   what like a two week time period adn already they expect me to   know if I enjoy it. I haven't even gotten out and done that much. Is   gotten a word. Oh well! I really feel weird in some of my class too. I   mean I graduated with 000 people and that seemed real big to me. I   knew everyone and it was nice. I came to LOCNAME because I wanted   something different. i wonder who is at the door. I t is PROPNAME. He owes   me money. He is from LOCNAME too. Oh I'm rich i got ten dollars that is   sad. Bye PROPNAME ! It was our friends birthday adnd and we spilt how   much we gave him. I gave ten adnd PROPNAME gave ten. Anyway this is   boring. I thought this would go by much faster. My room mate PROPNAME   types fast. I can hear her as she talks on ORGNAME messenger. I moos   every time she pushes return. That is a little annoying , and I think it   is funny because she laughs at the screen. I know she is laughing   at what someone is saying , but it is funny. What am I going to wear   tonight to my LOCNAME meeting. I want to look nice ,but not too nice   you know. I am talking to this computer like it is a person and not   where I do assignments. I am also typing like I talk and not how I   write which is a little weird. I think it is funny because I'll be typing   one thought and another thought will pop in my mind. Last night my   Kiddie Lit class was fun. She read us children's books which is   awsome. I think it would be cool to write a children's book adn draw   pictures for it. My hands look funny when I type because I have to   hunt and peck. I took a typing class one summer ,but it didn't help.  That sucks because I paid money to learn how to type. MOO MOO is   all I hear and that does get old. I hope PROPNAME did not think I was   rude since I didn't stop typing. I bet he understood because I said it   was for school so he probably doesnt mind. I wish I had one of my   mom's cookies. She is mailing me and my friends away at school   cookies. She said she put them in the mail today. My room mate is   funny. She makes funny sounds like EEK and eats foods I have   never seen before. Oh Well. I typed my mom an email today to give   her a bible verse because she sends me one everyday. My room   mate just left to go to class. I am glad I do't have class today. I hate   grammer. i never know where to put a comma dn and when I stop to   type a word with a comma or some form of puntuation, I forget what i   was going to say. Hey you can back space on this and correct   mistakes. Oh well to late now. One of the girls in class said she   backed spaced and had to start over , so i thought you couldn't do it.  It is weird I just now wrote down that you could back space when i   just backed space like forever ago and didn't think anything of it. I am   thinking nothing. Is that possible? I did not think your mind could just   quit working like that , but it is possible to be blank I guess. Well, I   like this assignment. it does not require that much thought. That   beep on her clock really hurts my ears . It is like a dog whistle i think.  I can't hear a dog whistle ,but is what I think one probably sounds   like. I wish I could meet more people. At my school back home I   know everyone. i am the funny loud girl ! Here though I am all quiet. I   wonder why? It might be that I have known the people at home for a   long time , so I am comfortable around them enough to be crazy and   be be me. Here though I don't know any one and I think i actually   smile less. Is that normal ? I hope so or not . It really doesn't matter   since that is just the way it is . I keep thinking about this boy too. I   guess I'll write about it. i have been trying not to think of him, but I   can't help it so here it goes. There is a guy here that is like eight   years older than me who is from my town. He is like best friends   with my cousin, PROPNAME. They both decided to come to UT, but PROPNAME has   already finished and PROPNAME hasn't. Oh my I said his name and I hope   no one sees this. This is kind of like a journal which is weird to me.  If people read my real journal they would think I was crazy because I   only write in it when I am mad usually. I write sometimes when I am   sad or happy, but I usually write or draw when I am mad. i was mad   at my ex boyfriend one time and I drew this crazy picture. He saw it   and said the person on it all beat up was probably him. He was   trying to be smart to one of his friends or funny. Whatever he thinks   he is. Sometimes I wonder if I still like him a bit even though I   should not because he is a liar and a cheater. We used to be best   friends before we went out. Don't ever date your best friend because   it always ends up bad. I thought he wouldn't cheat on me even   though he has cheated on other girls. i thought he wouldn't because   he would have respect for me. i think it is funny that every time I write   the word respect that I have to sing the song to get it right. Oh well I   guess he didn't have any respect for me though because he did.  That is wierd that I can still get mad about this and it has almost   been a year since we broke up. I'm glad that we did though even   though at the time it sucked. PROPNAME PROPNAME is fine. Where did that   come from. Both my ex boyfriend and Cass go to my church ,so it   does kind of make sense that that thought popped in my head.  Haha! I have liked PROPNAME since the 0th grade when he lived down the   street, but then he dated my sister. THey are the same age. She   was like 00 ,and she broke up with him by playing an Ace of Bass   song. That is like froever and a day ago. That is weird what you   remember. I can like hear the people around me. these walls are   super thin. The guys above us do the weirdest things like they make   weird noises. It sounds like they are taking golf balls and dropping   them on the floor. It is weird. They do it at random hours in the night   to which is always funny but annoying I think. Most of my friends are   guys so I don't find their stupid things that annoying because I would   probably do it too. i am not like a tom boy or anything though. Hey i   only have like five mintues though. My two guy friends that came with   me down here joined a frat , so we don't really get to hang out as   much as we used to. They are at some party getting drunk or on   some camping trip. before we came down here , we all agreed we   didn't want to go Greek ,but I guess they changed hteir minds. It   doesn't like make me mad or anything it is that I feel a little left out   sometimes. It is not their fault. i don't really want to go to the parties   though because I don't drink. Is parties with and   i   or an   s  ? Oh   well! I don't know about going Greek. I mean I am sure it would be   fun ,but I am not sure it is for me. Sometimes I think I am too fat to   join a soroity because all you see is really small girls pledging. It is   like trying out for cheerleader. i am not huge or anything. I used to be   though. I lost like sixty pounds in high school, but I am still fairly a   big girl. I look a lot better than I used to though. My sister has just   lost weight and now she calls me fat and tells me I should lose   more. She doesn't always come out and say it , but she will poke me   or laugh or tell me that i can have her old clothed because they are   WAY to small for her. She says they would fit me because I AM SO   MUCH BIGGER. That makes me so mad. I wear a 00 usually and   that is not that big. PROPNAME PROPNAME wore a 00 and people thought   she was beautiful. i am real curvy like her too , so some clothes look   funny and it can be hard finding the right fit. It will either fit in the   boobs and be too big every where else or fit every where else and   be too small in the boobs. Oh well I really don't care because I   usually wear blue jeans and a shirt from the goodwill. I love that   store. Sometimes you can find the cutest little shirts in there and   save money. I haven't shopped in awhile though because now I am   a poor college student. I like college though it is different than high   school in a good way. The professor here are so funny because they   can say what they feel and classes aren't that hard. i am almost   finished because I have like 00 seconds left. I thought I would never   finish and my fingers would fall off. I tried to write fast at the end ,but   now time is up , so I better quit. 
__label__label1      WEll college is something i was definetly not prepared for. In high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, I go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. So far in the during these 0-0 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. Which leaves me to consider that perhaps I should buy one of those rolling back packs. The readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. Although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting.           I really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. Always relying on fast food is disgusting. A person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. Which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. I have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. Because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. The peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. All they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them.        My classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. I believe i can do though. I have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. I wake- up at 0:00 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. She, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 0:00 am i am off to UT. Once i arrive on campus the time is 0 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. Our first class doesn't begin until 00 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. By the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 0pm and i get home at 0 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. But i realize i must read a chapter for Rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 00am, and once again i only get about 0 hours of sleep. This system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. I see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. Makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. Actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. I don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. This makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.            
__label__label0      I was so excited about coming to UT and I still am but alot of things just over whelm me. For example, people in LOCNAME are not a friendly as college students at other schools. Basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes. What it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. I nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 0. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. That really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. I know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. One thing that i don't like about living in LOCNAME is that it is so expensive to live here. Every place on campus is between 000 and 000 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. I really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. One more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. But i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. I wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. That is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. And now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. For example, in LOCNAME she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to ORGNAME i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. My goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. I can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams. 
__label__label0      I always pride myself on my ability to be creative but lately i feel restricted. I am spending more time absorbing everything around me than actually reflecting. I also feel lonelier than usual. I know this is normal, so I don't feel strange for the feelings. I am used to being surrounded by chaos and people  I know. All of a sudden, I'm in a school more than twice as big as my town and a dorm more than twice as big as my high school. I am deep down enjoying the experience. On the surface, I am just caught up in reorganizing everything. I am also still recovering from last year. I keep thinking that things will pick up and that I will meet people. I don't know if it is just a slower process than I expect or if I have high expectaions. All I know is that I love PROPNAME as much as I miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. I miss the scenery and the openess but now I get to enjoy a more vibrant and colorful scene. More than anything, I am excited to be around new music. I am listening to ORGNAME ORGNAME right now- as I have for the last year. Right now, I feel that my scene suits the music more. I also am excited to be around live music. It has a better taste. I think I miss good New Mexican food (burritos) almost as much as I miss my old room. I miss being able to walk down the street without running into another person if I feel like it.  I miss my friends. I miss being able to have inside jokes and laugh without even talking. I think I have more potential for good friends because LOCNAME appeals to a particular crowd including myself. In NM, I made friends with the peop[le that were available. In LOCNAME I will make friend with people that I hve common interests with. That is why it takes more time. I am not used to the freedom that I have recently obtained. I want to experiment with the limits of my freedom, but I just haven't found good opportunies. I haven't done much since I've been here. I can't tell if I'm lazy, timid, or just in the process of figuring out my niche. Education is more interesting when it is by willpower. I like learning when I have the choice to go to class. I also get the idea the teachers in college enjoy teaching more. That may be a generalization. I'm a bit scared aobut tests. I don't know how to study yet. I actually was scared yesterday, but not today. I bought a   to-do   list yesterday and wrote down everything that I need to do. Even though I haven't checked off much, I feel so much more organized knowing that it's written down. I actually fell more compelled to check stuff off (that's why i'm writing this now). I hope I don't fall victim to my lack of self dicipline and poor study habits. I truly enjoy being disorganized and careless. I think it gives me more personality and a more colorful life. A reckless and wild life has its o elegant motion. More than anything, I think having careless adcventures (i. e. hitchiking home from a party) makes me more creative. All I want to do in life is to write. Well, I want to do more, but that's my main ambition and source of happiness. I think adventures inspire what I write just as much as education builds a foundation. All of my college experience will be relevant. I get excited writing about what I want, but I then look back at the time I've been here and feel a bit unaccomplished. My wrist keeps popping when I type, and it really hurts. I have to slow down. I should probably start working out again if typeing at my computer is strenuous. My roommate is cleaning our room right now. She is a bit cumpolsive, but I'm glad that it inspires me to stay organized. Well, I'm organized on the surface. My closet and drawers are a different story. I love how I decorated my room. I think interior design is next on the list to writing. I wish I could study it, but I don't think I could make it into the school of architecture 
__label__label0 It's late and the fan is on it keeps spratically blowing on my arm. My arm is getting kind of cold. I have been reading for about an hour now and my eyes are kind of lazy. I have some catching up to do on my homework and i need to go get a book tomorrow, the one i got online was the wrong one. today was a long day, i'm glad it's over. three classes and a long work-out session. i like it though, the working out, it make me feel. . . good. i like to feel good. tomorrow is going to be an easy day. ony one class. my nails look bad i sure need a manicure. the fan is really relaxing with the blowing and the hum sound it makes. there is no other noise, usually there is a radio playing but not tonight, homework was the important thing. i want to do several things this week, attend some meetings for soccer and for this business fraternity that i want to be in. i think it will be fun to be involved with the school. i sure wish i could find some information on the football or baseball spirit groups. thats really what i want to do. i love watching ut play no matter what sport. i was athletic in high school i wish i would have listened to my dad when he said   you should practice, you could get a scholarship   i could have, the demand for girl golfers is pretty high. i didn't listen oh well can't cry over spilt milk. i miss my parents, i know they miss me. my mom calls alot but im glad she calls me because i would fell kind of foolish is i always called home. you know, everytime i visit i get teary eyed. i know that sounds stupid but its getting better though. i love this school though, the only school i ever wanted to go to. been a fan forever. everyone else in my family is an aggie. i will be the first longhorn in family history. pretty cool i think. i wish i could do more with my room. its too small and my closet. man i have no words for that. but i like it here, its close to school and everything else for that matter. the walking across campus kind of sucks but thats ok because its ut campus, that makes all the difference in the world. i can't believe i got into the business school. i still remember finding out like it was yesterday. i was completely speachless. literaly i had to go outside, it was one of the most liberating and self gratifying moments of my life. i am smiling right now. i have alot of pictures of my friends in my room, i miss them too. mainly my best friend PROPNAME, she is getting married in november and i hate that i am not there to help her out with all the wedding stuff, she calls and i always do what i can while i am at home but its not the same. we were neighbors you know. for the better part of out childhood. i am usually not this depressing sounding. i guess its the long day and all the prior homework setting the mood. my arms are starting to hurt because i am typing with my comp on a stool by my bed, sitting on the edge. its a strange position but i havent yet got me a desk. . like i said the room is small and well my comp desk was big. well good night.         
__label__label0 so , i am supposed to write what i think. thats sorat hard, because everytime you think a thought, it has disappeared by the time you have finished wirrint it. but at the moment i would like to talk about the one thing that is on lmy mind: my mother  yes, she is my mother, and yes, she is extremely overprotective. but i am in COLLEGE now . that is a wee different than high school in the sense that you have ot be. o whats the word. . independent   will do. yea you have to think for yourself, stand up for yourself, be yoursefl. except if your mother is preventing you from doing that, what are you supposed to do? if she doesnt let you come home later than whatever time she setss (which by the way is not very late at all) then you are basically in 0th grade again. do this, do that. and the worst part is, she never directly states what is on her mind. she starts out by asking questions. where were you all this time? i was worrying? why didnt you tell me?  i did ma. i don't remember  well thats too bad . i have to go tomorrow as well  where? when? till what time?  who what where when why and how, she might as well be a journalist. she instilled morals and values on me. doesnt she trust her own upbringing?  doesnt she trust me?  trust is anothe issue and overprotectiveness is another. or at least i think she is being overprotective. maybe to her indian standards she is extremely liberal. maybe. but this isnt india! this is the us, land of freedom. not that i'm going to go off and elope with some pierced stranger. i just want some privacy, some freedom. and most of all i want to move out. that in itself would solve so many problems. first of all, i wouldnt have to listen to her critisizing me one moment and loving methe next. she also would be liberated from my constant bickering and un called for interruptions. i wouldnt be too far away and yet not close enough to be distracted. everytime i try to study, she comes in every 00 to 00 mts. unless of course if she is taking a   nap   of 0 hours or so. but i feel guilty. i feel guilty for the way i am thinking. she deserves that nap, every second of it. if i worked as hard as she does, i would be half unconscious by now. but she finds time for a full time job, for being a single mother, for paying bills, for making food, for everything you would want a mother to do, as well as everything you wish she wouldnt do. she is the epitome of motherhood, in all its glory and grime. she has her pro's and cons, and i love her for that. but sometimes she can be a real pain.  enought about her, i still have 00 minutes of writing left. what can i write about. lets see, college. yes college is most definitely on my mind at the moment, because i am doing a college assignment. i also have a bunch of homework to do after this and it is already 00 pm. i am not too good at doing all nighters. the latest i have slept is 0 am. and that was not study related. that was lets have a girl cousin talk thing.  but that aside, college seems to be hard, but not as hard as i had thought it to be. i am not completely clueless as to what is beingsaid in my classes, but at the same time, i am quite amazed at the amount of reading that has to be done. its not the reading actually, its the note taking that is required in intense detail and that takes up a whole lot of time. i am trying to think of what to think and it isnt working too well, so i'll just write about my family. well theres my brother and i could go on and on about him. personally i think he's a spoiled brat. he has as much potential as his fourteen yr old cerebrum can handle, but that potential is over ridden by his spoiled bratedness. he is plain spoiled , by my mother mostly. when i was his age ( now why does that sound so familiar. . i am not that old, am i?) i was super disciplined by my father; the beatings, the cruel and unusual punishments, the whole package. yes, so i think i am definitely more responsible. whereas my younger sibling, he has the disadvantage of being not only a spoiled brat, but an extremely lazy spoiled brat. he reads a lot, and thats pretty much the only good thing about him. another controversial curse in the form of a blessing is that he can phase out the rebukes of my mother. now one minute ago i was critisizing him and now i'm commending him, but not really. it only seems to be a boon at certain times, like if i really did not want to hear my mother tell me how all the other girls my age are doing jobs and iam sitting around and my legs are gettin fat andn how i should exercise more. because she has already said it 00 times that week and wishes to say it once more, as if i couldnt hear her say it 00 times, whereas i actually could. that didnt sound like it made sense. but yea. this stream of consciousness thing, i did it in senior yr ap english. my teacher, mrs. lydic was one . . uh. . unique lady. she was somewhat crazy in the sense that she drank unbelievely outrageous amounts of coffee and had this almost supernatural smirk/ smile on her face. and her hair was always the exact same way. side parting with a big dome of hair on the top. yes i sound so shallow in this  callow description of her physical faults, but it was that mingled with her personality that made the ap english experience not really unpleasant, but unusual. so after i discovered that i had to do a stream of consciousness paper in psychology i thought, i can never get rid of lydic. she will always be there. not that thats a bad thing. i suppose it is thanks to her ( and my own diligent efforts) that i got a 0 on the english literature advanced placement exam. but now i have less than 00 secons left and i would just like to say, this soc paper didnt really provide a catharsis for me. 
__label__label1      Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask PROPNAME to go with me. I also need to call PROPNAME. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 0 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 00. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has ORGNAME and ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask PROPNAME today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with PROPNAME PROPNAME right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and PROPNAME never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew PROPNAME PROPNAME would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and PROPNAME comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home. 
__label__label0      well today was an ok day i guess. i had to wake up at 0 and then got to class. then i went to the gym and ran 0. 00 miles. i was really proud of myself at the time, but then i ate all this food and now i just feel really fat. oh well.   i feel really bad about my friend josh. steff treats him like crap and she doesnt want to break up with him but she doesnt like him as much anymore. he wants to marry her so i don't know how THATs going to turn out. i was really proud of him tho because he confronted her about it and i hope she realized what shes doing to him. well imean, she knows but she doesnt realize that hes a person. to her, hes just this guy who follows her around and worships her like a goddess. you know, which is nice, but he can't please her anymore. shes picky about how he stands and if she doesnt even want to see him no matter what he does she gets mad at him. its really sad because hes a great guy and hes a good friend of mine.   we havent really been able to talk much lately because hes busy worshipping steff and not looking for time to spend with me. but thats ok im not bitter.    im kind of scared about my classes too. i havent has any real work so either im missing something very important or its all going to pile up on me later and kill me. like a mudslide, its going to be ugly. i do have that calculus homework that i could be working on right now but im so un-motivated to do math right now so im writing for my psychology class. how nice, i know.   my aunt sent me a care package in the mail today. it was so exciting to open up my tiny little mail box and find a pink slip saying i had a package waiting for me. she sent me cookies and icing and 00 dollars to target. lots of cool stuff at that place, target. maybe i can get more workout clothes for when i go to the gym. maybe if i ever feel like i don't wnt to go anyore, ill just stare at all my clothes in the closet and feel guilty about spending money on them and i might as WELL use them. i love how i know how my brain will work.    i miss my boyfriend a lot. hes a year younger than me and hes still back in san antonio. i know he misses me too. and he has a car but he can't drive it because it doesnt work. which is even worse because i want him to drive up to austin and see me! but alas. i have to wait to see him when i go back into town. which is like every other weekend. but also my parents are selling my car so unless he gets that car fixed, i won't even be able to see him then! its so sad.    i like cookies    i got a new alarm for college that has a really big display on it and has dual alarms (one for monday/wednesday classes and another for tuesday/thrusday classes!) but the sound it makes is sooooo annoying! it makes this click right before it goes off and thats what wakes me up, the sound of dread. i could recognize that click anyday and it would strike a feeling of loathing into my heart. also the snooze button is really small and close to the   alarm shut off   button so i not only have to look for the button but to be careful how  i smack the machine.   i have a 00 pack of highlighters that i havent used yet. well I've usd them but only for coloring things and un-highlighter like things.   also my friend russell is having girl problems. i don't know the whole story so i can't go into that. yeah and my roommate thinks i like him. she makes a big deal of it, so i think SHEs the one who likes him. but i dunno. hes really cool.   i have another friend who is having girl problems too. this is really weird. i don't know his story either because he wouldnt tell me. but he will sooner or later because i can beat it out of him. why are guys having problems right now?    i have a cow from chic-fil-a sitting on my computer monitor and hes wearing a sign that says   chikin on a bun. pure geenius   and his arms are like lopsided because hes a cheaply made toy, but it looks like hes waving to me. like hes saying   eat some fooooooood. you haven had enough to eat todaaaaaay. fooooood.  but luckily for me i can contain myself and say   no thank you mister cow, but im fat. moo.     00 minutes is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say. maybe i should type slower. my fingers are cold from typing. its relly cold in my room.    do people atully read these things? i mean, what if someone wrote about how great the sex was with their girlfriend? would the writing czar be offended? or would they publish it and read it outloud. how do i know that the writing czar even cares about what i think. if i were in high school still i would say this is busy work, but i guess ill give you guys the benefit of the doubt that you know what youre doing and since this IS a psych class that it must prove something. i just hope i can be enlightened when this is over. i want to sit back and be in awe at what this tells me about myself. kind of like those tests and thespark. com. those are fun to do. can we do that for another writing assignment? they have IQ tests and personality tests and any other kind of testyou can possibly imagine. they even have a test that will determine what sex you are based on how you answer certain questions and past test takers and such. but since this is a psych class imsure everyone already knows about THAT. 
__label__label0      here we go. i don't think my typing can keep up with my thoughts. the palm reader said a few weeks ago, that i was very mentally busy. anyways, this red hot chili peppers is pretty good, although i don't like that cabron song. i wonder if you get penalized for not writing as much. should just take the easy way out and claim i am a slow typer. so this is what college is like. doesn't seem so bad right now. i heard the first year was easy. this class could be a little tough, but the professor seems to know what he is doing. i wish i could type without making mistakes. that would be cool. i wonder if lisa will call me today. we seemed to really hit it off the other day, and she does seem interested. i wonder if that is just her personality to be really nice or what. hard to tell if she has a lot of other guy friends or not. my roommate got back quickly from houston already. kind of pathetic only going for one night to see his girlfriend. i don't know why that makes me upset, i guess because she is still is high school and he talks like a moron when he calls her on the phone. back to lisa as usual. i can't believe she likes all the same music as me. i wish there were some concerts coming up this month to go to. i don't know what there is to do for a date without a car. especially since we are not the party types. twenty minutes is ridiculous. it has only been 0 right now, and i am spent. oh well, glad to get this done with. i have a feeling the studying and assignments and what not are going to be piling up soon. is that how you spell piling? doesn't really look right, but whatever. i'm kind of curious what the next page says about what i have writen. i should finish my reading today, that should only take a little while. here comes my favorite song on the cd. i wonder if they will release it to the radio. i bet the next page says something about if you don't capitalize your words correctly, you are this type of person. this email writing and aol instant messenger has left me with some bad habits. oh well, no big deal. i don't really the red hot chili peppers that much. kind of too much funk in their music for me. it sounds good, but their lyrics are a little shaky. i'm really glad i got these headphones though. i hope calculus tests aren't that hard. the ta seems really nice, and hopefully he will know what is going to be on the test. i still don't think the teacher knows what he is doing. we're up to  00 minutes. not bad. lisa. can't believe how this is working out. i wish i remembered more about her from elementary school. i'm kind of worried about her being smarter than me. it shouldn't be a problem, i guess i'm not used to it. makes me think i have to act smarter around her. not smarter but smart. she doesn't get in to that intellectual stuff that much. kind of crazy, i think about this girl like i have known her for a long time, and also that we are dating. i think what i said constitutes as a date proposal. we'll see pretty soon i guess. i don't like how i say i guess all the time. it's in my im's all the time. got to mix it up a little bit. 0 more minutes to go. i wonder how long the average one of these is. 000 kids in one class is huge. there were at least 0 people from my high school in there. god this is getting lame. the writing lady went to northwestern. kind of cool my best friend is going there for journalism. much better than arizona state or wherever economics lady is from. wonder where pennebaker went to school. can't tell from looking at him, had to be in the east though. probably isn't the best plan to do this while listening to music. kind of affects your thoughts alot. especially rhcp, they say some messed up stuff. the new cd is good though. they have kind of mellowed out. i wonder if i will see them when they tour. kind of an expensive ticket. but it would be cool to say that i've seen them. well looks like we are ending   
__label__label0 Ok. I don't like to write, but I guess this isn't really writing. there is a hair stuck between the keys. Ans I can't get it out. it is bothering me. Why are my dogs barking?  Maybe my sister is home from school. I don't know what to write. My nose itches. I am hungary. I want to go to chilli's, but I don't kow if I can. I am so bad at typing. Man, I wish that I had my computer. I can't beleive that no one was here when it came. I better get it by this weekend. ok, i guess my sister isn't here. Then why were my dogs barking?  When is she going to be home?  She should be here by now?  What time is it?  Ya, she should be here. PROPNAME's sister is home allready. Is thst how you spell allready?, or do you spell it   already   with one l?  ah, it hasn't even been 00 minutes left. I think that I burnt my tongue on that kolache. It wa sgood though. I want that other piece of it. I miss my little kids from la petite. I wander if I should get a job there on just fridays. But, I don't know if I will have time to work and get all of my studying done. Probibly not, because I am already a little behind on my reading. I hate Chemistry. I really dread going to that class. I don't understan it at all. It's like the profesor just skips over the basics. How am I suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school. I should have goe to that help session thing. well, it would have helped if I knew where it was. I wander what PROPNAME is doing. Hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here. well, I know he isn't because he would have called me. Did he take PROPNAME out to PROPNAME with him?  bla bla bla. Where is PROPNAME?  I am getting worried, I should call mom. Maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus. I hope she is ok. I need to call my mom. I really want shrimp pasta stuff. That would be really good. I need to read. I have so much reading to do for biology. I don't want to take Amber to her school. What a pain in the but, I am never going to be able to finish reading tonight. I don't have time. 
__label__label0 so IÕm in the computer lab of my apartment right now yeah these people in hear are kind of noisy. yeah I really wish I had my own computer, I talked with my dad today and he said maybe by Christmas theses walls are interesting. they really need to put paper in the copier and printer. I have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that I can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. IÕm thinking about what to write. what can I write that wonÕt be too ummmm whatÕs the word, I donÕt know lol. I wonder if theyÕll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah I donÕt seem like a weirdo hmmmm. I think IÕll eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and I have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then I can eat the Italian bread I got today with it too ah man IÕm getting really hungry, lol. ah man, itÕs only been 0 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. Like you can run a lap in 0O sec. doesnÕt sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesnÕt make any sense if you donÕt know what IÕm talking about. there was something else I was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok I forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what I mean about the no computer thing? Not having my own computer really stinks. So anyways. I think IÕm going to work out tonight. I usually donÕt like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isnÕt too bad. I think thatÕs because I can look out the window when IÕm running lol, even as IÕm typing this stuff I am thinking about totally different stuff than what I am typing. like when I was typing about the treadmill I was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since IÕve been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate letÕs me use her laptop sometimes so I donÕt have to come down here, but her keyboard is a French keyboard and itÕs really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. Ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow I fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because I was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb. I remember when I was little and I would be riding in the back of the car with my family and I would just be thinking to myself like everyone does, I guess, well anyways. and I remember how I would go backwards on my thoughts and think of how I got to what I was thinking about. probably what this writing assignment is trying to do well anyways. ooooo those brownies sound really good too. maybe IÕll make brownies when I get back upstairs ooooo those sound so good. I am so hungry!!!! I donÕt know what I would cook them in though. I donÕt know if we have a pan I guess IÕll find out when I get back upstairs IÕm almost done with my laundry. I need to start reading the psychology book too and taking notes. lol, I donÕt think I actually think about all the stuff I have to do as much as this writing assignment may make it seem I really hope I like architecture. lol, that was out of no where too. well actually the truth is that I canÕt type as fast as I can think and while IÕm typing IÕm actually thinking about other stuff than what I am typing. hmmm l0 minutes what made me think about architecture was that I was thinking about psychology and that made me remember how I thought about majoring in psychology (thatÕs really hard to type!), but that was after I had already made up my mind to major in architecture. I donÕt know if architecture is just a phase or if itÕs something I really want to do. I donÕt know. weÕll just have to see how it goes really I wonder why the time thing is green anyways.  I really, oh now I forgot. oh wait. I really hope it works out. IÕve even thought about government though so I can do something about womenÕs rights, I think that would be cool. maybe I could do both could I do both? I donÕt know this is so confusing, how are you suppose to already know what you want to do with your life!!?? But of course PROPNAME always knew he wanted to be a pilot. l0 min. now I wish I had more time I hate how everyone is oooooo ahhhhh air force academy. who the heck cares, its just the air force academy and no itÕs not impossible to get into I could have gotten in if I wanted to but I didnÕt want to I have no sympathy lol, yeah probably none of this makes a lot of sense since you donÕt know what IÕm talking about. but I donÕt think thatÕs the point. itÕs just to see how one thought leads to another and then another and so on. not really mattering what your thoughts actually are. just so you can see how one thing leads to another.  lol, I am SO redundant!!!!        
__label__label1      how am i going to do with all my classes and am i going to make it through the next couple of years in college i just want to do well with college and achieve i do not want to mess up ar my classes going to be really tough and how can i manage my time to study for all of them right now i am not doing well and i haven't started off very good but i know i need to do better and set time to study for each class i just want to succeed and do well i just got an essay back from my last class and didnt do too well. will i be able to do better and understand what i'm doing in Philosophy?  i am feeling kind of sad but i know i want to do well and at the same time i am happy to be here because i enjoy this school and it is very interesting i feel sad because i miss my friends back home im going back home but should i really go because i need to study here and should stay here to catch up on reading but i can also catch up on my reading at home although i probably won't because my friends are back home staring around just thinking of what is the right thing to do i need to make time for things and get organized i feel really lost right now since i don't have anything organized just sitting here thinking about going back home and school not really listening to anything but the people talking out in the hall it's not noisy but just hear a couple of girls out in the hall having a conversation it's very quiet in my friend's room and i'm not listening to anything just sitting in this silent room and looking around at pictures just kind of upset about the essay i just got back and thinking that i could have done a lot better if i understood the question better but now that i know what to expect on the grading i know what i need to do for my next assignment my friend just walked in and talked to me which made me lose focus of what i was doing but now i am just here alone since she went into the hall to talk to other girls where i can still hear them having a conversation and laughing looking around at pictures that my friend has on her desk and seeing that she has pictures of family and friends everywhere i miss my family and my friend back home that i want to leave right now to go back home because i just want to go and hang out and do the things that i would do with my friend every weekend i miss spending time with him and just always getting to hang out i should start studying though right now because i need to do well in my classes they seem to be very interesting but a lot of reading and i really enjoy them  just here staring away at things not really knowing what to type anymore just looking around at pictures and out the hall still hearing the voices out in the hall talking and thinking that maybe in a while i'll go out there and talk to my friend and her friends just to see what's up or maybe i'll just stay in here and read or talk to a friend online not too sure what to do yet now it's kind of quiet since theres no one in the room with me and the television and radio aren't on except there are the girls talking in the hall still they are just going on and on and i can hear them but not really paying attention to their conversation just hearing the voices because the door to the room is open it's kind of good to be alone right now because no one is bothering me and it's not noisy it's just nice to be alone right now i have to go pack right now since i'm going home and i don't have much time left to pack because i'm leaving in a while so i have to go rush and do that 
__label__label1      Well I finally found the website for this place, and now PROPNAME not really sure what to say. Im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. Im also very angry at my roommate PROPNAME right now. Sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. I signed up for an experiment thing in my CSD class, and I have no idea where the room is! All it said was PROPNAME and the time and I have no idea what that means. I hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. Oh I also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. I almost forgot! The ink on my hand is already wearing off, I should go write down the time on paper when Im done with this. I really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. But its cool because I want to major in communications. The lady from there never called me back! I should call her again soon. Well maybe I can get the application online or something. I wonder whats going on with the guys next door. They're always coming over here to say hi. I think Im going to ask PROPNAME if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! Hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. Poor PROPNAME. I can't believe hes sick now because of me! I hope hes feeling better. This chair is really nice! Yesterday was pretty scary, I get really nervous about stuff like that. The bells at the Tower were really pretty though when they were playing God Bless LOCNAME. I guess its a pretty historical moment, and Im glad I was here for that. Even though this wasnt my first choice I guess its ok. Its kind of big, but maybe I need that. Wow its been 0 minutes already. I don't know if this is due by 0 today. wait what is today. Ok I ha 0 classes so its Thursday and oh ok Sept 00. Thats tomorrow. This is crazy. I should get started on that map too. I wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. Yeah I bet it does. Why else would I be writing it. I think it said it was going to give me a printout of what I wrote and something else too. an analysis? I don't think a computer could do that. Wow tomorrow is friday already yay I get to see all my friends back home! I have to go see PROPNAME and see how LOCNAME LOCNAME is! He said hes still going to work there until the end of the year I think. I wonder what college he'll end up going to. He could get into ORGNAME, I hope he does. If not hs coming to ORGNAME so that'll be cool. Uh I can't believe this morning! Im so mad at her! I wonder when shes getting back! Should I act mad or just let it go? Its probably better if I tell her. Yeah I will. I think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. Simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 00 minutes. I guess Im doing that. Kind of just whatever pops into my head. Oh feelings. wasnt I supposed to write about my surroundings too. I hate messing up and having to backspace! Well I still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because I had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. I wonder what chapter Im supposed to be on for this class. Oh man Chapter 0. Ok well I have 0 done so that shouldnt be too hard. Those notes took me forever! I need to think of a faster way. Well I could highlight like in my geography book, but I think I might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. I hope nothing happens today! Thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. Its hard to type out all my feelings because I think faster than I type, so as soon as I think something, I start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. Plus I think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe Im not really recording exactly how I think. Hmm. gosh Im hungry. That breakfast was really good this morning! I thought it was going to be weird since I went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. Thier Theirselves. that doesnt look right. Hey I have 00 seconds left. Uh! As soon as I finished writing that the time was already off. This is annoying. Ok well I guess Im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what I actually wrote nonstop for 00minutes. 
__label__label1      i can't seem to picture anything but just seem to think of silence and the color white. It also seems to help me think of me sort of like a simple person and how my mind is thinking of my personallity and the color white as if i am a boring person. Then i think that it is not the color that best represents me because i really believe i am outgoing and that the color white is dull and really not me. I seem to be distracted by the air condition in my apartment as if everything i am thinking is interupted my the noise of the air. Blue pops into my head sort of associating the air with the color blue but now it seems as if that is impossible because you can't see air then why would i associate it with the color blue, maybe because it is the color that artists have used in the past to associate wind with. Now i have a song by Puff Daddy in my head and all i know is that i repeat inside my head  the same verse   as long as we're here we might as well shine together   i wonder if they are actually his words because before he has been accused of copying words from other artists. Yet it is surprising that i am writing so much and not complaining, maybe because everything is just poping into my head this is different i usually don't think of anything. now i am thinking i don't pay enough attention to myself enough as if i ignore what my minds says. If once i could actually stop and think what my mind says like i am doing right now maybe i would be a better person and i wouldn't be in the position i am put in all the time and maybe just maybe i would'nt be in trouble all the time. now that i say trouble i think of my girlfriend and start to wonder what she is doing and maybe what she is thinkning. isn't it weird how we rather see what otherpeople are thinking rather than seeing what you yourself is thinking. i just thought that was weird but true. now i wonder what all this means all these mixed thoughts without no real sense in them. how can a test be made to tell me what or how i think that's weird. but then again that is the 00 century for you staring right at your face. Were there tests that could tell you how you thought 000 years from now or is this just something recent. that last sentence seems stupid like if i were asking the air and waiting for a response. it is raining outside and it is the first time i see rain in Austin because i am not from around here it is amazing how the sound of the rain makes me want to sleep but now after so long i found out that rain or the weather does not affect a persons mood. thats weird if there were anything that i was certain in psychology was that it did affect your mood or the way a person felt. just now i wonderd why do they say that if there is an eclipse it is bad for a preganant women. Just out of now where i thought that. Is it bad? wait a minute who am i asking thats weird how i still want to know something and rather than asking someone who might know something about the subject i rather ask myself to see i really can not come up with an answer. I wonder where my parents are if they are at work or if they are at home and if it is raining there too like it is here or my brothers where are they who knows we hardly see eachother anyways so it is as if i were home 
__label__label0      coming to ut has been a pretty crazy experience. my first week here i already felt like i was at home. it wasnt that way at the college i attended previously. that place took my two years to get comfortable. i think it has something to do with the fact that i have grown friendlier to most people. the one exception is my roommate drew. i don't know why we arent best friends, but i think it has a lot to do wiht the fact that we come from two entirely distinct backgrounds. he was the son of a cop, whos prents got divorced, and i was the son of a librarian, who parents always talked about getting divorced. also, here women seem to enjoy my preasance more, i think that has a lot to do with my radical overhaul of my diet and exercise routine. one girl in particular is named vanessa. she is an entirely charming girl, with a body to die for, but i don't know.  how do we trully know we found the right one, is it that divine spark that fills our soul thew first time we lay eyes on a person or is it a familiarity that stems from shared time with someone that eventually turns to amore?  unfortunantly i was cursed with finding love at frist sight with my fist girl friend. but being as young as we were, i cnat help but think what would hve happened if we would have met later. on this subject i have often wondered about my parents, i have a vague notion that theirs was a marraige of convience. i overheard one day that the last time they had sex was the night i was concieved?!?!!??! i don't now what that means, just came up. this i think is the point of life. the wondering, lust filled age we are in now, followed by silent impotent contemplation. no wonder why all people in power are old and white. they don't have the drive in their hearts to find romantic ideals the way youth does. in a sense i think i am an idealist. i like to see the glass as half full, but usually only with people i care about. this deals alot with social conciense. what a terrible thing to have. all of us who are educated are confronted evertday with the absurdities of our goals. i want to have a nice house and car for my family and i want to help the world. but would i accept lesser for those i love to compensate those i do not know?!?!?!  off course not, yet high minded individuals lambast me when they are doing the exact smae thing. so in the end what does one do, pursue their own intersts or bang ones head against the system. i think it has to be a mixure of the two. because the more one knows, the more one knows that nothing in this world is blakc and white. tragis heroes are made from this assumption. we see how they are commended for making the right choice and getting awarded for it. but seldom do we see all the others who struggle to make the moraly right choice and are punished incesantly. growing up poor i saw this all around me,  many of the poeple i know cannot afford to make the right descision. i myself have chosen to get a college eduction rather than have medical insurance. really in the last 00 years i have done a lot rather than have medical insurance, namely eating, having clothes, and living life. all this ties into the idea that there are not racial barriers anymore, but class barriers that are divided by check books. thats not to sya that the overwhelming majority of poor are not minority, but only looking at color doesnt diagnose the true problem,  money. 
__label__label0      Write now I'm very tired I just got home from LOCNAME. I haven't been getting much sleep lately so I have really been dragging. I'm fixing to eat dinner with my family. I have alot of homework to do tonight including some calculus which is very frustrating. My house is very quiet the only sound in it seems to be me striking on these keys. This is an unusal assignment I have never done anything like this in the past. So far I am enjoying school at Ut it is my first semester and although it is all a little overwhelming I think things are going to work out. I have to comute back and forth everyday that is the only thing that seems to be gettiong old. I went to the UT football game on Saturday I had a great time but, wished that we would have played better in the second half. I love sports I have played them since I was five. I fact this is probaly the first time in my life where I havn't been playing sports. Now the noise in my house starts to raise a little as my brother gets home from tennis practice. He is a good kid I'm glad that he is doing so good in school right now. He tries really hard, and takes things really seriously. I smell my mom making diner. She works in LOCNAME as well and has to commmute just like I do. My mind is drawing a blank now, I'm so tired it's hard to concentrate. I guess I am a little worried about school, I have to make really good grades this semester because I'm trying to transfer into the business school. I have put alot of pressure on myself to do good in school. I get stressed out when I don't understand some of the material in one of my classes. Calculus worries me the most. I have never been that good at math. I'm struggling right now just going through the review. I try really hard in all my classes but I'm worried that won't be good enoegh. Oh well all I can do is my best. My house has grown quiet again much like it usually is. Now I hear my phone ringing but nobody seems to be answering it. I'm looking forward to a warm bed to sleep in tonight. I have to wake up early to go to work though. I enjoy work at least it breaks up the monotony of being in school all day. Well my time was just up so. 
__label__label0      Right now I feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Last night I felt cranky and could not concentrate much. I think it had something to do with having two tests on a given thursday. My nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery. I noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as I walked to all of my classes. I thought that meant that there was high humidity or something. Possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat. I just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations. One for meningitis and the other for Hepetitus B. I felt worried about diseases when I arrived on campus. In addition to the worries, I obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that I get the shots. My left arm feels a little different than usual. The nurse warned me of possible side effects but I was not too worried about that because I do not have any known allergic reactions. I think I try to type faster than I am able to and because of it I seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often. I think that when I was learning how to type I emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy. My neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp. My lower back pain has been giving me some trouble. I remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine. I felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good. I came out to be that I had an extra lower back vertabrae. Not too rare but not particurally normal. My eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now. Ever since I started wearing contacts , for about 0 years now, I've been worried about the dryness, redness, and clarity of my eyes. I might need to use some eye drops now. I think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects. I usually don't think stuff like that will effect me directly. Although some things that i don't think effect me usually do. For instance when I got into my car crash about three months ago  I didn;t think that it would happen to me. My parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but I would usually ignore that fact that I'll end up in an accident. I wouldn't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful, but I would just let the message slide. I would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents. I should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment. I sometiems feel that people don't listen to thers anymore. they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications. Girls might do this more than guys. but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable. I would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems. It's not that bad but it;s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do. I crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes. I'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night. This is different though. I't what I say to myself. I wonder if that will ever be ignore. Probably not since it's not someone else controlling me but myself. Control is difficult to explain. I'm wondering when this will end. another minute or so. After a whild of this I started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not. I don't think i;m a fast typer or a good typer. Just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes. Less by looking at my fingers.  
__label__label1   right now I'm thinking about my poor roomates because one of them, PROPNAME, just found that her little sister woke up this morning to find a bullet hole in her window!  If her bed would've positioned different she would've been dead!  I'm also thinking about my other roomate, PROPNAME, she just found out that she didn't get the job that she wanted because she doesn't have time to go through training. I'm also kind of stressed because one of the reasons I came to this school is to do crew and now I'm nervous I'm not going to make the team, aghh. I also am stressed because I have a lot of homerwork to do right now such as reading for psychology and writing my english paper. It's also hard because I miss my family and wonder why I'm here, but then I think how I wouldn't be happier anywhere else. And then I'm wondering about who's going to be reading this and wondering if they think I'm a psycho and then I wonder, is anyone going to be reading this?  go figure. I'm also really excited to be here be because I hate the snow in LOCNAME (where I'm from) and am so excited not to  be cold here this winter. But I miss all my friends and hope they are happy where they are to. One of my best friends sisters said that in your first two weeks of college you change in ways more than you could ever fathom and you are such a different person the day you walk into your dorm and the day that you walk out. At college you have time to discover who you really are, and that is really cool you, or at least I, can discover who I am without the distractions of my family, my responsibilities, and my friends. In LOCNAME no one knows who I am so I can reinvent myself to be whatever way I like, I can take time to discover if I really like myself and if I don't I have four years to change myself into the person that I want to be, wow I really like that it sounds nice. I just hope that I meet all the people I can and I hope I can get some best friends, I also worry about money and the fact that I'm spending it and not making it. Sometimes I'm so stingy. I also worry about how my family is going to survive without me (I know that sounds selfish) but I do a lot of things such as being a peacemaker  between my sisters and cleaning up after my dog who isn't potty-trained and driving my sisters around and running errands for my parents, I'm sure they'll be fine I just in a way hope that they aren't so that they miss me. I hope that this writing piece doesn't seem self-centered because I'm just writing about myself. I just don't know what else to write about. I'm also listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME, I love her voice it is so awesome. oww my hands are sore I could never be a secretary.  My major is actually elementary ed with a minor in psychology. I'm really excited to be a teacher but sometimes I wonder how I can be so excited about it or if I'm setting feminism  back because I will be happy in such a traditional role. But hey whatever floats your boat right?  Sometimes I get so excited about the way I'm going to decorate my classroom and the curicullum I'm going to teach. I'm also very excited to take all the classes that are required for my major. They should all be very exciting and hopefully the professors will be enthusiastic because how could they not be they are training us to go into their profession. It's so exciting how college is the step before my real job my whole life I have been preparing for college and now I'm in college and preparing for my next step, my job.   
__label__label1 I really don't feel like sitting here and typing for twenty minutes, but what ever. I'm kinda tired. All I want to do is go take a nap. I really don't want to go back to LOCNAME, I get lonely. I hate this stupid town, but I don't want to leave home, but then again I do , the air is cold when I breathe in  and I need to go take my medicine  oh well I'll go do that later  crap I'm tired and I don't want to go read either it gets so long and boring and I'm not doing that research crap for justin either why do my toes always get so cold the rest of my body is warm but not my toes, I wonder if I have fever again my nose is running but it's stopped up at the same time , that retarded I feel like going to sleep right now, why is the timer not working? is this stupid thing supposed to be working cause if I don't get credit for doing this thing I'm going to be pissed, it's probably this retarded ass computer. stupid shit never works  I don't  want to go back I like school I just wish I knew peeps up there it's going to be a long four years damn it I just wish I was already graduated and working and not worrying about any thing, just making money for my-self not depending on other people this way I could do what I want why can't I do what I want I don't mean bad illegal things just I don't know stuff  I swear I'm not coming home any more if my parents don't stop trying to give me a curfew, what the hell I'm out of high school I'm in freaking' college, and my dad still calls me tell me it's 0:00 and I need to come home what? ugh I swear, man I better do good in school oh well I'm not worried about that yet not until I have tests then I'll probably freak out stress out what ever my face itches my lips are chapped I wonder why though it's not cold or anything but it is cold in this house why am I always so damn cold it's points less to shave my hair is all grown back on my legs and I shaved last night I don't know why I bother to shave stupid shit why are cuss words bad" words what is it that makes them bad, the meaning isn't bad when you think bout it I guess not, do they even have a meaning for real why are they so bad hm I don't know here we go with the goose bumps again man I have o get up early tomorrow ugh and I have to read a lot of crap oh and print my homework still damn I hope I remember to do that shit I better not forget god when are the freaking twenty minutes up? and why is this timer not working? what the hell  maybe it tells me my time when I press the end button, haha presh = push and press I'm so retarded but I hope that it shows my time when I finish cause if I have to trype for another twenty minutes I'll be pissed or pised like on the sweetest thing, what ever LeAnn your so retarded man I need to figure out how to get the internet in my dorm just in case I have to do this thingy over again, hm dad has birthday this friday, yeah I get to come down here again, I kinda miss home if you think about it , but I'm not going to tell any one cause they'll just say see I told you so, but the only thing I miss is the people I hate this fucking retarded hick town and I like being out on my own I just HATE being by my self I get so lonely man I got to stop thinking about this other wise I'll make myself homesick oh well I'll just have to suck it up and not worry about it cause I'm not dropping out or transferring I went through a lot of shit just to get here now damn it I'm staying I just don't like living in the stupid dorms oh god I don't want to go back there.

__label__label0 Just like everyone else's writings, I'm sure starting off with I don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like "king kong" or "umbrellas". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the "hobbitt" project and austin named one of the characters "dildo daggins". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say "dildo" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn't in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 0 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying "firewall alert" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause I don't like computers to begin with and I can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 0 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said "is that thing STILL beeping?" and she told me it had been beeping for 0 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 00 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don't know where my roommate is, she left at 0:00 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 0 but she is still not back and it's almost 0. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don't have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it's a standard and I'm not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, PROPNAME (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in LOCNAME this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $00! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can't wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I'd get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in LOCNAME from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in LOCNAME a youth group of about 00 came up from LOCNAME. I really miss LOCNAME- I can't wait to go back, even though I don't speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from LOCNAME, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time's almost up- I really didn't think I'd be able to type and think for 00 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye! 
__label__label0 Well I start typing now. so I don't really know my computer stopped making the fan noise why does it do that. the simpsons are on next door I could watch that but I'm stuck doing this oh well what is that oh yeah I like that I'm full even though the food is not good its all you can ear I love all you can eat. well since I don't really know what to talk about I can just write about things that I my phone rang can I answer it I don't think so oh well ill call them back I hope it was not JB calling about the hell raiser meeting damn oh but I can write bout things I don't really talk to other people bout like when I left I didn't really expect robyn and I to last really although I wanted to and but now it is not really that hard and I love her but kinda find myself wishing it was harder so that I could hav an excuse if I needed one to get out. but I have differing opinions on it mostly cause one moment I miss her and jus want to hang out with her but the next I get annoyed that I have to talk to her. and when other girls talk to me here I feel like I shouldn't even though there is no reason not to and robyn wouldn't even care the slightest cause she is so understanding and this is why our whole thing is not that hard. cause she makes it easy. that's the main reason I stayed with her cause usually I don't have relationships ever. this is mainly my first and definitely my first serious one which is another thing sometimes it seems so serious I'm like back off but when she acts casual I want her to act more serious. I guess the whole thing is stupid and I shouldn't worry bout it cause I am easy going and I should let things go with the flow I'm going to call dusting when I'm done so I can see if he is going to the hell raisers. wow it is quiet in here with no music I want to turn on ole PROPNAME but ill wait 00 min left this is going by fast. I thought I was barely talking. I wish I knew her name I talk to her everyday and she is in 0 of my classes and she introduces me to people and I don't even know her name that's kinda fucked up but I could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name. that would work I wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all I really do anymore is read and study. quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh I am talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy I'm going to his room in well 00 00sec so I can wait no 00 - 0000 well 0000 now but yeah I think I'm going to work out after the meeting. I wonder if they let anyone in that 00s show is on I hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man a guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night. it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with a pistol right in front of her. robyn felt bad but I didn't know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in a long time so to me it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. this is getting long now that I'm looking forward ahead in the direction of I'm thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired I'm not blinking I need to ok wow that burned I shut them for like 0 sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny I burped and hiccupped at the same time. I wonder what this is going to say about me I don't really care though cause I think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on a lot of levels the lie detector was cool though I think I could beat it maybe but well that's all 
__label__label1 This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask PROPNAME if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be PROPNAME or PROPNAME. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 00 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the LOCNAME. It was good. PROPNAME PROPNAME looked really crazy in the movie. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  
__label__label0 What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 0% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish PROPNAME would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 00% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 0:00 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 0:00. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the LOCNAME. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 00% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw PROPNAME PROPNAME in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 00% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 0 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (0:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. 
__label__label1 There is this annoying noise in the back ground that is driving me crazy. It's like a loud bell or ring. I am really frustrated right now because the internet doesn't work in my apartment, so I feel like I can't do much for school, which isn't really good, because I am addicted to the internet. My leg really, really, really hurts still, it's swollen and black and blue. It's making it really hard to walk around campus and to do my job at work. My head also hurts, but I don't know why. I am still tired from class this morning, waking up and going to calculus two at eight am is very hard for me, but that is what fit with my work schedule. College doesn't seem too hard for me, I guess it is because I am a person that likes to get all of her work done. I do feel that psychology will be one of my hardest classes because it is unlike any class I have ever taken. Calculus will be the easiest class because math is my strong point. Chemistry will take a little work, only because physics is my strong point, which would make sense, since it is going to be my major. The time seems to not go by as fast as I thought it would, and my head still hurts, but I think this time it hurts more because of that loud ringing in this computer lab. There seems to be too much going wrong and too much to think about right now. This is a very frustrating time in my life, and I just want to get through this fast enough to not cause me psychological harm and stress. I think my parents have lost their mind. I've been gone for a little over a week and they are having withdrawals. I was just there last saturday, and they only live thirty miles away, so it's not that hard to visit, I just don't have time and don't feel like I have to visit them all the time. Work is so boring, I actually dread going to work most of the time, mainly because some of the people are idiots and think they know everything, then they just screw up something and I have to fix it. My advice to anyone is to not have a job in retail, it's very stressful, especially if you are a perfectionist. Straightening tables and organizing clothes over and over, then watching it get messed up by uncaring customers can really drive you up the wall. If I sit here and think about how I am feeling, I realize how much my body is in pain from going to the lake this weekend. Jumping off cliffs into water, then climbing back up doesn't really do wonders at all for your muscles, especially when you have none. I was looking forward to moving out so much, and I am still enjoying it, but there seems to be something going wrong almost everyday. Not only does the internet not work, they haven't cleaned our carpets and repaired all the messed up parts of the apartment. It's stressful to think about all that needs to be done, and the amount of time left. Time is something I hate. I wish that some days had more time in them than others. When I was younger, all I wanted to do was grow up, I wanted the time to go by fast. Now that I am in college, I want time to slow down, and have some extra time. There is TOO much to do in so little time. My fingers have gotten cold, I wonder how that happened. You would think with the constant moving to type, they would be warm, but they are not. I would really think mine would be warm, I type to fast for my own good. Now I am running out of things to say, I can't think of anything to type. My neck hurts now from staring at the computer screen this long, and of course my leg really hurts because I am sitting on it. I really hope work goes by fast today, I hate the 0 to 00 shift, it's so boring, and it makes me feel like time goes on forever. Time needs to fly when I am in class and at work, but slow down when I am chilling with friends or doing homework. There is never enough time to do homework. When you think about it, you think ?there is plenty of time to read this paper? or something of the like, but when you start to read that paper, and work on the homework, you sometimes feel like you hardly get anything done. I just remembered that I need to read the next chapter for psychology. That's what I get when I start to randomly talk about topics that are odd, I slowly remember what I need to do, but that doesn't mean that in an hour or so I will remember what I just did. Stress causes ?brain farts? that allow you to forget something as important as homework and assignments. Unfortunately I get a lot of them, and that is sometimes why my grades are not perfect or close to perfect. I forget little details like dates (ok, that isn't real little, but you get the idea) and simple mistakes, ESPECIALLY in calculus. I make adding, subtracting, and multiplying errors in calculus. I can do anything in calculus, but adding and subtracting actually make me think if I don't have the calculator in front of me. That makes me sound dumb, but I am not, I just forget the little things and basics. Wow, the time has flown. 
__label__label0 my room seems nice, I mean it's not like home or anything, but the privacy compensates. I wonder what mom and dad are doing. Hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia Juany    but anyways, my roommate is making noise by the mirror. it's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and I turned it on. I simply left downstairs for 0 minutes and I come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel, just surfing the channels when I wanted to watch the my show. anyways now that that is out I can continue. yeah, my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator. I went back home last weekend. I bought a couple of books which I want to read, but seem to have no time to do it; I have a ton of class reading. well, biology seems like it's going to be easy, chem. a little work, nutrition just pay attention during class. c. c a lot of reading. my roommate always eats late at night and I'm trying to help her get better eating habits, but in my opinion, she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight. her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines. this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me, like I want to talk on the phone with them. I don't like talking on the phone. I should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless I'm doing absolutely nothing; I don't like to get distracted especially if I'm watching tv, or doing some kind of school work. she (roommate) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are . 00 cents     yeah, I haven't done any laundry since I got here but I can still manage with what I have in my closet. I really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers. well, it would help if I got all my book first. I'm missing one coincidently it's psy, I went yesterday and they have no more. hopefully by tomorrow they do I need to go over there after class. thank goodness I only have one class tomorrow. I have to finish my ch and c. c homework, shower, check mail, write my tuition check. red robin,  I worked there an entire year last year,  too much work for not enough money. my roommate was my superior there, but I worked as well as she did ,and many of times better (simply because the team liked me better)      it's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her. don't get me wrong my roommate is a great girl; I've known her since 0th grade. I like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what's on her mind. yeah, they're calling her up to ask her to work this weekend, I'm not working there until the break. yeah, this time around I'm registering for my classes early, so I don't have closed classes like this semester    but I have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester, having to move a lot of things around    well time is almost up    so later            
__label__label0 ok, ummm, I'm hungry. just got out of psych class and I was hoping to go home, but must turn this writing assignment in before friday. the lie detector presentation was interesting. sadly I started nodding off around the part where dr. PROPNAME was talking about dopamine and schizophrenia and parkinsons. I was never completely asleep, just in and out of consciousness. man, my typing skills are really sucky. anyway, ricky's in my head. he is turning 00 on september 00. I always think he and chelsea should be together because chelsea wants it that way. wanted. she says she is over him, but I don't know. I am excited about the garlic toast I'm going to make with andrea's tuna casserole. yes, my roommate is also andrea. she is the more prominent andrea. totally super smart, super pretty, super nice. I could totally jealous. no, envious because she has what I don't have, she is not taking what I used to have. yeah, I could totally envy her, but it's just not so. she is a blessing. so. I need to make a bracelet for jodi. hopefully she is doing ok. and why is kirk still in my head? we weren't even super friends, just very casual acquaintances, but he manages to pop back in my head after three years. great job kirk. actually, I think I like thinking about him. or the idea that I have of him. I don't really know him so I can only entertain the ideas that I have of the hypothetical kirk. and I feel old. and worn out. and everytime I'm close to the edge of the sidewalk and a big bus passes by, I somewhat regret that I didn't fall or stumble into its path. I'm not suicidal, but the drama that comes with saying or writing these things is fun. I could die so easily. if death came right now, I'd go with him. even more so if he was cute. but I have too many people to be responsible to. not just friends and family but everyone who I've told that life is good. where am I going with this? I don't know. but it's more interesting than an itchy foot, no? so biology is making me feel anxious. hard professor, dr. edmiston, but I like it that way because it's like a battle or a contest. you get through, if I get that A, then it's going to be so cool because it's such a hard-ass class. andrea's hardass class is physics, but hers is plan II so it's probably triple the intensity of my biology  class. I'm glad I have something to work for, something to worry about because it was too easy at uta (arligton). I was not' challenged so I slacked off. worked more and got more money, yeah, but wasted time and  money on classes that I liked but weren't going towards nursing. oh well. I tell andrea I feel like a gray crayon here in austin. but I don't feel that all the time, just when I realize how gray I am compared to others. I'm thinking of what to type so this is probably only partial stream-of-consciousness, and not because I have something to hide but I'm better at writing. my thinking and writing speeds are almost the same. or, that's not good, I can slow my thinking to my writing speed but not to my typing speed. and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. an eternal darkness, but I wouldn't know because I'd be asleep. but then if I ever wake up on the other side I'd feel guilty leaving people behind. so that was twenty minutes? yeah, if you want to see more stream-of-consciousness just ask to see my blue notebook. I usually sit front and center and no more than three rows back. but who would care? but it's there. ok, bye! 
__label__label0 well let's see, today was an okay day. psy class was pretty interesting. mr pennebaker is a funny guy. too bad I have a feeling that class will be hard. I hope I do good. I really want to make all a's this semester and my whole time here at LOCNAME. I'm listening to this new song I really like. I listen to it a lot. its by nasty boy clique and the song is called I want to love you. it is not a dirty song. it's really nice. the first time I heard it, it made me think of this guy I like. it's kinda our story. I like this boy a lot. and he does too. I miss him. this feels weird writing what I'm feeling to someone I don't even know. but anyhow he is 000 miles away from me. he goes to school in waco at tstc. I really hope he does well, and I know he is. as I look at the time its only been 0 minutes plus some. man this sure is going pretty slow. hmm. what else. oh yeah I need to read fast food nation for english class. I hate reading. I was wondering how I would do in college since I don't like to read. I'm doing okay so far, but I don't know. I have to take a quiz in that class tomorrow. I'm lost for words now. my own little writer's block. and a whole 00 minutes left. well no one is in my dorm right now. the 0 other girls are gone. this one girl she sleeps really early like 00. or at least that's early for me. but the bad part isn't sleeping early but she SNORES, and its very loud. gosh we all hear it. jessica just came in the door, and scared me cause I thought it was her. but anyways, I'm bored. I really don't want to do this for 00 minutes but I need to cause I want the grade. what else? oh I ate popcorn. it was nice. it was cheddar. there was an extra bag of cheese to add. yummy in the tummy! :) on my little desk I brought a phone right, and it doesn't work. the phone jack is whack. shikisha's phone jack doesn't work either. only jessica's. lucky her. now I'm looking around my dorm to see what else I could write about. I see the picture of me and brian. that's the guy I like. darn I wish he was here. he will call me when he is out of class. *smiles* hahahaha as I write this I was just thinking that the people who read this and analyze this get that females usually write about relationships, boys, and all that mama drama. mannnnn. I wonder if boys do that too? hahaha. crap I need to to barnes and noble and buy magazineS for english. what a waste. all I need are some ads, along with that I have to deposit a check so I can have some money in my bank account. my friend danny keeps iming me, and his mean self warned me. I will warn him back when I'm done with this. and just now my sister imed me asking who warned me on AIM. I think I should do something today, but I'm not sure. that party at the plaza thing is still going on. but all the organization people are gone. they had some basketball scholarship thing, putt putt golf, and other random things, but I didn't do any of it. I just passed by. my left back hand has *due writing assignment online. and the online is underlined. hehe that was my reminder to do it. I did it after I watched supermarket sweep. cause there wasn't anything else to watch. and I did this cause I had nothing else to do. I wonder if my buddies want to go and do something? gosh darnit I also need to go to that jester thing where they help you with homework. I need some help in math. I guess I just don't understand. woooo hoooo. like 0 more minutes to go and I'm done. in this counting minutes/seconds I will just say. HOLLA [term used in houston. hahaha] a lil ghetto, since austin isn't. 
__label__label1 So I'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. I feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but I wanted to get it over with. It think it's funny that you, Prof. PROPNAME, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. It must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my PSY000. My mom is always reminding me that I didn't take it in high school and that's what I get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. It shouldn't be a horrible class though. I can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. I love writing. I've been writing a summer journal for the past 00 years and I love it. I'd love to write for a living but I just do the journal thing well. I could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything I want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than I thought. it's only been 0 minutes and 00, 0 minutes, 0 minutes and 0 sec. ok I can't do that forever. what would happen if someone IMed me right now?  would I fail the assignment because I stopped writing?  I should have turned it off. yuck. I just burped. ew, I just wrote that I just burped. see, I had spaghetti for lunch and I can still taste it because the food sucks. I miss home all ready. I feel like a dork because I miss home, and I want to go home every weekend. I need to be social. I need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 0 minutes and 00 sec, 00, 00. ok I'll stop for real now. I am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't I?  I guess no one will know. why do I even care?  I keep switching in and out of I and I. capitals that is. I never do capitals when I'm typing on AIM so why should I do it now. I don't think it capital letters. !  well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. I hope this works because I don't have a printer that will verify that I actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, I live in san jac and I had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. I wouldn't talk to her even if I wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird!  I guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. I've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez I'm a  dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified I'd be. I just try to blend in everywhere. I know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, I would die of embarrassment. I'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, I miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from GR came down to hang out with him, and I got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. I'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and I don't. I guess I'm jealous?  I don't think so. I don't know. I wish he would just not nap right NOW when I could be talking to him. I can be mad about that right?  he COULD talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh        I'm kinda thirsty, can I stop to get a drink. I guess I can wait 00 minutes. HEY this is my favorite frank sinatra song. Luck be a lady. man I want to do a dance to this. I want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things I want to do at my wedding, but I wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me I'll be cut off when I get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. I wish money mattered a little to him. not a LOT but a little. I like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it?  oh geez, well, why does it matter?  you probably won't even read it. why would you read MY paper out of the 0000 people that you have in your classes?  0 more minutes. I'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but I got enough sleep. maybe I got too much sleep. I hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. I don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh!  my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 0 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. I want to go out tonight. I don't want to see major again and I don't really want to hang out with da, but I feel like I need to go out and do stuff. I'm really sick of eating  by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me?        lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, I'm a giant dork. WOW. how mortified I would be if you knew who I was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. I'd probably cry and run out. I've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. I really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. I had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and I had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. I hope you never read this, and I hope I get credit for it. all I ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. I would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 00, 00, self destruct,     ?        
__label__label0 Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, PROPNAME. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 000 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss ORGNAME ORGNAME much. Just some of the people I left behind, PROPNAME included. Things change, I went down to watch a ORGNAME LOCNAME football game last week. It was against our border rivals PROPNAME PROPNAME. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 00. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 00 in their place too. Good old? PROPNAME PROPNAME, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 0 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together. It's a Tex-Mex term from LOCNAME Pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. I'll tell you more about the origin another day. Oh yeah ORGNAME suck. Come on pull it together men! Win one for the gipper, do something. The team played horribly in the second half. Hope they do better next week on Monday Night Football. Man this is crazy. My foot itches, damn athlete's foot. Should get something for it. Typing late at night is fun. I need to go download the new Obie Trice Album, too bad its only on PROPNAME right now and I can't get it yet. In due time I suppose. I still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. My roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. I'm glad I'm not taking any science course this semester. Life is good though. Small problems aside I don't have much to complain about other than Calculus, but I'll be fine with it. 
__label__label1 I have a ORGNAME's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder (a tribute to PROPNAME PROPNAME) and I am watching it now. My desk is a bit cluttered. purses, markers, papers with assignments that need to be done, a Dr Pepper can. I am unsure what to write. I began a painting today, and did not finish it. my dorm doesn't feel as though it's a creative environment, but I suppose the dorm won't change. so either I have to change my perspective, or not paint at all. My eyes are heavy, and I am cold, because my hair is wet and squeaky clean. My hands are warmer than usual (they are usually as cold as ice, or very near as such), and I shall have to remember to tell my mother, because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating. It is ten to midnight. My mind is active, but I lack in motivation. I am excited about this new life I have, as a college freshman, but I am also extremely nervous. I MUST do as well as possible this year, so that I won't have to return back home to a run-of-the-mill local college (as my dad has threatened if I don't succeed in producing a pretty-looking GPA), and also my future as an architect (the career which I would like to pursue) is depended solely upon my performance this year. I did not get into the architecture program this year, and should like to transfer in as a sophomore. I have run out of things to discuss. I miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home. I had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that I have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat. I brought only the bare minimum of books with me, my art books, of course, and my absolute fave novels, one of them being A Wrinkle in Time. I am fully aware that it is a young adult novel, and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite, but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless. My room smells of the body wash I use (Energizing Citrus, I LOVE it) and stale mr. gatti's pizza. there is a faint tinge of acrylic-paint smell. My roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit. My bed is full of pillows, two black hearts and a red furry one, and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me. I am, for once, not hungry. but merely satiated, as I feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger. I have less than seven minutes to go!  I wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo. In what way do you benefit from reading this?  I can't imagine how anything could come of this, except perhaps extreme boredom, or maybe resentment. There is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend's subdivision in LOCNAME, holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such, and every time we drive by her, I think: That has got to be by far the worst job in the world. She stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on, holding a bent sign and a jug of water. And I can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is: I am a pole. "  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, with one simple gesture, a stick could be stuck in the ground, and the sign pasted onto it, and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job, and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up, and it just kills me. And I am glad I am not her. I am glad I am not a whole bunch of people. The End. 
__label__label0 I don't really know what I want to write about. I am about to start watching football. I used to like pro football a lot more, but now I really just don't care. I would much rather watch college that pro. I am downloading some music right now. I am ready for this paper to be done so that I can go and watch some football. I hope that this class isn't too hard. I don't want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major. When I was walking to class today I was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier. But it will be ok, I'm just going to have to study. The other reason that I don't like that class is that I don't know anyone so everyday I come in a couple minutes before class starts and I sit down. And the only talking that I do is small-talk with someone that I don't know. That gets old after awhile, saying the same thing over and over again. IT's always what classes are you in and how's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing. It just gets really old. 00 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock. I am ready for the weekend to start. Football weekends are the best. This weekends tailgate is going to be a blast. There are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling. This is getting old, because I'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and I am about to fight him. He keeps on laughing at me and I don't like it. Here's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder. He is not as much of a prick as the other one. I don't want to fight him right now. HE just walked out of the room. My other suitemate hasn't walked in yet. He probably won't. He is pretty weird. He sits in his room and plays video games most of the day. Other than that he just spaces out and watched tv. He doesn't party either. I feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff. I think he knows one person up here. But they don't really go out and that is no fun because I know that he is not having a good time up here. But maybe this is just the normal thing for him. He doesn't seem like he was a real social person in high school. I only have 0 minutes of typing left here so then I will be done and be happy. I'm listening to some new austin music right now. This paper is almost done, so I am happy. My friend just told me that his dad drinks o'douls, that would not be fun. My dad drinks real beer. Now my paper is done. 
__label__label0 I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. PROPNAME this song by PROPNAME PROPNAME reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. "  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  PROPNAME, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back PROPNAME. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 00?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over PROPNAME PROPNAME! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you PROPNAME. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. PROPNAME, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special PROPNAME was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor PROPNAME said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can PROPNAME be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive PROPNAME. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not PROPNAME that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having PROPNAME too. Hehe. 
__label__label1 Okay so now I am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing. I wonder why I have to type that out what am I thinking of course this is what I am going to write        this music that I am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer I feel very stressed out writing to a real timer I don't know why        I think I will take off my head phones    I had planned to write about a lot but for some reason I can't seem to do more than   write what my head is thinking about    for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did I guess I can start by describing my environment lets see    the air smells like air    the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window    right now there isn't any noises and I feel somewhat stressed and anxious    the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not I actually have a though or not and I think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct    if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed    I can't believe I have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like I have to help him but I fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me    I just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart    as if I feared that I am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly    I can't believe I have already written for 0 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts    but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what I am doing, like I cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which I was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here I am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and I wonder if I am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense I really hope it does because if it doesn't well I guess my mind is simply disorganized    but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, I really think I cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do I actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything I've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? I have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather I can hear it, its a strange process         I guess I really can't multitask when I am writing a stream of consciousness I see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered        perhaps I am not truly tracking my own mind I MUST DWELL FURTHER IN. I'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something I didn't know existed        I remember my childhood I don't know why but for some reason I start remembering it whenever I think too hard that or I am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should I go pick it up? maybe I will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like I had to pick it up for a bit, I hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 00 seconds of non thought but I can make up for it because it was my friend who I needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though I dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here I am fixing mistakes in my typing        maybe I should just leave my mistakes in so I can listen to myself more. right well now I feel nostalgic or actually no I don't I just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and I was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if I were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. I miss my childhood and here I am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. I would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but I guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about  it, yeah I make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually I have written so much    originally I had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but I guess that was yesterday night when I was heated up about it today I just feel complacent about writing about nothing. I see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now I feel disappointed        why am I disappointed? I guess I just thought I could find something that could prove that I am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that I write even regular to all people? I don't know but I like being special. well no. now I feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 0 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, I can't really plan ahead, I can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away I guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and I don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps I forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am I so eager to put interest in this bit, I do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what I just said god. now I am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if I tried to organize it I would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that I think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes I end up saying nothing because I dunno I know I obviously have a stream now but I guess since none of it makes much sense I can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps I am just afraid that if I do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 0 more seconds. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. bye     
__label__label1 Well, I guess this is the first time that I have ever done anything like this. I mean, the first time that I have talked about ANYTHING to anyone. What I'm really thinking about right now is index cards. I need to make flash cards for my Introduction to Medical and Scientific Terminology class, and I don't have any index cards. I feel like I need to complete that task now. Why is it that I must always do EVERYTHING in one day? I just can't ever seem to take my  time and relax. I guess if I had any form of OCD, that would be it; I'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule. Now, if I wait until this Stream of Consciousness Writing is over, it'll be like almost eleven thirty at night before I'm done. Should I really go out and get my index cards then? I need like a pack of 000 of them, but I really need more for the future. I guess I could wait to get more index cards when I get home to LOCNAME this weekend, then I would know exactly where to buy them, or I could even get my mom to get them for me in LOCNAME, that would be very convenient for me. I miss my mom most. She does everything for me. Its not that I miss her just because she did everything for me; its just that she is this really great person. She is so genuine. I know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy. Why can't I meet more people like that in my life? I hope I marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can. Man, I miss my dog, too. I guess I am a little obsessed with my dog, but I can't help it. She is so cute. And she is been there ever since I was like 00. We're inseparable, and I wonder and worry about how she is doing without me. Dogs are great aren't they? They never get angry at you or make you upset. They always are loyal, and give love one hundred percent. I wish that people could be as nice as dogs are. I wish my boyfriend would be happier. He is the main reason why I worry so much of the time. I really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen, until I met him. I worry a lot about him, not about our relationship, but about him. I wish he would be happier, treat himself better, love himself more, and feed himself. The man's the pickiest man I have ever met! I have never made one thing that he thought was yummy. I have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good. Everything is always decent. " Decent? I know he doesn't mean to be condescending in any way, but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending. I know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, I don't know if he will ever feel that. That's one thing about psychology. My boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when I try to give it to him. I believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything I do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. His mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. It's all in the mind. If he told himself to like it, he would; But the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. All right, I'm going to shut up about him all ready. I think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. It's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show "Sex and the City," except that these thoughts are really not very private because I guess Professor PROPNAME or one of the TA's is going to read it, but I'm really okay with one of them reading it. It's not like I have anything really vulgar or nasty to say. I'm so full. I don't think I should have eaten all that PROPNAME PROPNAME and Cheese, but hey, on the bright side, its a great source of calcium, which is something that growing women need, so I guess its kind of a good thing. Hahaha. I can't believe that I just tried to justify overeating, at least I don't have to worry about getting fat over it. Nobody in my family is fat or even chubby. I don't think I've gained any weight here because I do so much walking, so who cares if I ate extra macaroni; I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I added salt to it instead of butter, thus I feel no guilt. Dude, I could really go for a ORGNAME right now. ORGNAME ORGNAME is so good. Its so expensive though, and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys. What makes it taste so good? I think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it; not like that nasty gross Diet Cola. Diet Cola is disgusting. I don't understand why people drink Diet when there's real Cola. I'm sleepy. I don't sleep much here in LOCNAME, because all I do is go to school, and then I come home, eat, and then do homework for the whole rest of the time. It's a bitch. I need my sleep man. I don't get more than 0 hours of sleep at most. I had four freaking classes today! Can you believe that? from 0 in the morning to 0 in the afternoon, I had class. And get this, what really made today bad was that while I was waiting for the bus, a huge, green, black striped, spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face! I thought I was going to DIE! I HATE SPIDERS! If I had any kind of phobia, its spiders. I don't like any bugs, but Spiders are the worst. They're so ugly and creepy and scary. I thought I was really going to cry. It made me so anxious and nervous. I went home and showered. My writing assignment is almost over now. I feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time, how pathetic. hahaha. I'm kinda sad because I like writing all my thoughts down, but I'm relieved because I have a lot of other stuff to do still. 
__label__label1 well, I don't exactly know why I'm doing this, but I do enjoy the idea of trying to figure out what's in this head of mine. PROPNAME's checking her email, but she will be leaving soon to go get a bagel. I'm not that hungry because I had a huge breakfast. there are a lot of people in this library. I wish I had internet connection at home because it would be so convenient. I wonder what my parents are doing right now. I wonder if their business is doing well. I wonder when they will be able to retire. I wonder when God will essentially allow them to stop working. God works in mysterious ways, and that's what makes him God I suppose. I'm really glad I got to talk to PROPNAME last night online. He is a nice guy. I got to talk to carol too, but really didn't have much to say, which is not surprising. there's a lot of interesting different people here at LOCNAME. such a contrast from LOCNAME LOCNAME, where everyone wants to be popular and only buys the best things in life. but are the things they think are the best really the best? don't think so. I miss home, but I really do enjoy it here at austin. I haven't been homesick at all, which might be a good thing or a bad thing. I feel like I abuse my parents so much, verbally. I don't ever take into consideration the fact that they have feelings too. I just say whatever to them and never think clearly. in a sense it is good to be comfortable with people, but being completely immune to their well-being is not good at all. why am I such a malicious person? I think sometimes being malicious on purpose might be better than being malicious without even thinking, because then that means that being malicious has become second nature. I really need to work out more often. I've gotten so freaking lazy, and as a result, fatter, or ?healthy? as my parents call it. why am I so frugal, actually it shouldn't even be considered frugality because it's to the point of stinginess, like scrooge. I don't get it. I try to not think about how much money I spend, but I get so greedy and selfish. I seriously think that if food wasn't so essential to life I would probably not eat and horde money all day. why God? actually I shouldn't be questioning you. I'm sorry. it's my fault. I am just an evil person. that's it. we are all just naturally evil. well, that sounds too Hobbes-like. we do have good in us, but we are all sinners no doubt. but I seem like my sins all go unnoticed because I do them so often and I don't realize it anymore. I've got 00 minutes left on this. shar's going to the restroom. I have so much reading to do. and sometimes I feel like I read and read and read and study, but then when I get to class I feel like I did nothing at all. wow, 00 minutes is a pretty long time. not when watching television or a movie. I guess time does fly when you're having fun. I wonder who thought that one up. I haven't seen a movie in the theater in awhile. I wish there was a dollar theater close by. I wish I could get a job. I wish I could manage my time better. I should really take into account opportunity costs of everything I do or buy. sometimes I wish I was more economically conscious but then I feel like sometimes I'm too economically conscious. I do too many things for my own good. I never think about other people. instead, I think how much of my own money, energy, etc. is going into making someone else happy. that's so wrong. man, I have psych in about an hour. I wonder what we will talk about. I wonder if I read enough. I wonder how my first quiz in college will be like tomorrow. I really need to stop eating so much and work out more. I cannot possibly rationalize all my eating by my walking to and from school everyday. 0 more minutes. I wonder what God thinks of me. maybe I shouldn't wonder. what else is there to say? I feel like my brain has been racked and pried. is that how you spell the past tense of pry? I have so much reading to do. did I mention that? by the time I get home, I will probably be so tired. but I need to read. shar's going to her echo meeting so I will be home alone with no internet access. man I am so spoiled. as early as 0-0 years ago I didn't depend so highly on technology. but look at me now. well, I guess we should look at ourselves now. what to say? I wonder what my parents think of me. I think too much about what other people think of me. I need to stop and think about what I think about myself. I thought that girl looked familiar. hmm. I'm almost done dude. almost done. only 0 minute left. I have written a lot. well at least I feel like it. now that I'm almost done I feel like the 00 minutes went by really fast. so I guess this was both enriching and entertaining to see what's in my brain. 00 seconds. done! 
__label__label0 I got to pee. I don't know how long I can hold it. Maybe I should of went to the restroom before I started this thing. Oh well, it's all good. Man my neck is still sore from lifting weights on Tuesday, and I need to lift again today, I really need to stop being lazy so I can get strong and get in shape. I hope I can get notes from the class I missed today, that's already been twice I missed the same class and we have only been in school for less than 0 weeks. Man I really need to start picking it up. It don't make any sense to send in a transcript for a scholarship when my transcript doesn't exist at this school yet. What am I supposed to do? Also transcripts are $00 a piece plus a $0. 00 if you use a credit card. It's stupid. Man my hands are starting to hurt, 00 minutes is a lot longer than I thought. I need to figure out something to do on Saturday, I mean this is Austin plenty to do, but choosing what to do is kind of hard especially when you don't have any money. I am getting tired, about to fall asleep after I finish this, but I got to do that math homework so I don't have to worry about it later. I just heard a weird sound, I think it was my stomach but I just ate so it can't be that I am hungry, maybe it is just digesting some food. Oh man another 00 minutes to go, they should have shortened these writing assignments to 00 minutes when I would be done by now. Ha ha ha, that's pretty funny, ha ha ha. I wonder what they are going to think of my thoughts, it can't be that bad, but what was up with that pre testing for the experiment requirement, it took forever and a day. Man I wish this school were closer to my home back in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I already kind of miss home, I think I might be homesick, but I haven't thrown up or cried so I am not sure. Man I still got to pee. I don't see how they say this school has the best looking girls compared to all other colleges, because I have only seen a few girls that are cute and few that are really cute, maybe I just haven't seen all of them in this gigantic school, I swear I am going to have strong ass legs by the time the semester is over from all this walking. Oh yea there is that girl that looks like PROPNAME, now that girl looks good, I really need to stop being shy and talk to that girl. Who knows she might give me a chance, you never know. Then there is also that girl in math class, she is real cute too, but I have talked to her, but I need to get to know her better. What should I do tonight? I could play basketball in PROPNAME or volleyball downstairs here at Jester, so much to do so little time. I am almost done, then I can go pee, and go do my math homework in PROPNAME & PROPNAME's room since they have the book. That's stupid that you have to buy the ORGNAME ORGNAME with the book, I just wanted a used book, but no they didn't have any. oh well it is cheaper to just use Jay's book when I need it, besides I only use it for homework anyways. Oh man this thing is over, and I really need to go to the bathroom. 
__label__label0 this is my first writing assignment. I'm watching cosby on tv. I have a headache. I've had a headache most of today. I woke up and was still dead tired even after 0 hours of sleep. I had a stomach ache and felt like I was going to be sick. I had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so I got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good I think for breakfast. I think from now on on mwf I'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. I was supposed to have a study group tonight but I called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but I don't really need it. I think I'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. I had calculus in high school but got a 0 on the AP test so I'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since I'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. I was thinking about switching majors to psych cause I really enjoyed everything I learned in high school when I took it. I don't know if I'll switch over though yet. I'm liking me ee000 and 000 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day I've felt like crap and I miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since I've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 0 0/0 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. I'd come home every weekend if I had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. I'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. I don't care about the experience. I'm here to learn and I do that during the week. I do all my homework when I need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't I come home and spend my time with the one person I want to spend time with. well I know people here that have offered me rides so I can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause I spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on I'll get rides home from other people so I can spend my time with who I want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. I feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how I feel. I love my mom and everything, but I'm not really close to her at all, and I've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and I am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. I'm so close to mariko and I love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. I've been thinking about going next summer. I'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 0000 dollars for the ticket and I'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then I've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. I really want to go. my mom's really against the religion I've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and I hate how she feels. but through religion I've learned how to deal with all these feelings and I'm comforted now and I forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. I'm kind of tired and I still have a headache. I want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time I checked, and right now I don't want to walk back down there 0 floors to find out. I don't' feel like a sprite either, I could go down to san jac again. I think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. I need to move around more or something I guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and I can't stand it. I put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and I put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so I guess I won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but I don't think it matters. oh well. I have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. I like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. I miss her so much. I hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. I don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. I wish I could help her more but there's not much I can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason I want to be home still. so I can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and I call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 000 or church or school during the day and then I have classes at certain times so I can't just leave and call her. but I'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so I don't think I'll get a couple calls in this week. I'll call on the weekend though since I won't be going home this weekend. hopefully I meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. I seem to be the youngest person there. and I'm already not a talkative person, so I think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 00 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well. 
__label__label1 So I'm a little nervous because I don't know what to do about my fig meeting today. I'm supposed to have it at 0:00, but last week no one was there. I can't decide if I want to go back  out into the heat or just skip it. I wonder if it can count against you if you skip a fig meeting. I feel so stupid about being nervous to email the instructor. I am so excited about this wrist band thing. I wonder who I will go with to the OU game. I can't believe it is so soon. I'm freaking out. I hope I get a date. Lets see. I promised to get me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME a ticket so I can get three more for other people. I can't believe I am actually seventh in line. I hope the guy wasn't tricking me or lying to me because then I would feel really stupid since I've told a lot of people. Oh well. I don't even know what to right on these things. I really wish I was taking a nap right now. My thoughts don't flow as easily when I am being forced to right about them. And I really don't want to say something that could some how embarrass me. although I do that enough anyways. hmmmmm. This class seems like its going to be really hard. I am so confused about what my major should be. Why in the world did I choose advertising when I really don't think I have any interest in it at all. I wonder if its ok that I'm not capitalizing my I's". I'm so used to instant message typing. it gets hard to used apostrophes and capitalize words. oh well. I hope my cousin is doing ok at her new school. I feel so bad that I haven't talked to my parents so much since I've been here. I don't know if I have even called them twice. That makes me sad, I just feel like I don't have any time. Man , I really want some PROPNAME queso. maybe I'll get some later. I need to get this printer fixed if I want to be able to print anything out. Dang it. I wonder if I need to print out a confirmation sheet for this. Wait that is just for the pretesting. which was extremely long. I wonder if we can backspace on this thing. hah. I'm so excited about this weekend's "white trash party" my phone is ringing. I wonder if I should pick it up huh. I guess Ill just let it ring and listen to the answering machine and see if it is someone important. dial tone. ok and now my cell phone is ringing. ill just look and see who it is. of course its patty. its always PROPNAME. I can't believe I got a yellow wrist band!  Its so awesome. It really annoys me how I always press the Caps Lock button when I'm typing. I think I do it like once a minute. I must be the worst typer in the world. It really grosses me out to find my roommate's hair all over my floor. I don't know why she can't just pick up the dust buster once in a while. Oh I need to unlock my door so patty can get in. Oh well, next year's living arrangements will  be better. But that really stresses me out! I can't believe  I have to get my roommates together like before October. How do you even know who are your good friends yet. Well at least I will be with PROPNAME. I wonder if PROPNAME is going to want to room with us or if she is just going to want to get her own group to room with. I'm sad PROPNAME is not going to get an apartment. I don't know why she wants to be an RA. It just seems like way too much responsibility. Oh well. Man I'm hungry , and it is a long long time till dinner. That sucks. Oh good, I thought I lost my Advertising syllabus. but its on my desk that is good. OH yah, I have to go do study hours tonight. That is good. That means I don't have to do my homework now. Maybe I can get in a little nap. Or maybe I should see if my fig is meeting today. I really should work out some. I have totally fallen off track on my working out. It totally stresses me out that I'm probably going to gain like the freshman 00. That is going to sucks. Oh well at least its better than being 00 pounds like last year. Maybe I shouldn't write that on this. Oh well, I tell everybody anyways. I just have like absolutely no motivation to work out. They are right about one thing. PROPNAME might be close, but your bed is so much closer. I hope my parents aren't like shocked when they see me again. lol. Where is PROPNAME. She called like five minutes ago and it definitely doesn't take that long to ride the elevator 0 floors. Maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book. I need to tell her I will need it tonight during study hours. She will probably be upset. Its my book though. I really need to put away some of this clean laundry. What am I going to wear at the White Trash party. I don't know if I really have anything for that. I guess I should go to ORGNAME and get a wife beater or something trashy like that. I really want to wear a trucker hat. Ill borrow one. Okay here she is. F 
__label__label1 hmmm. I was wondering what I was going to think when I was planning to do the assignment. well, I can hear that tv. married with children. I thought they were off the air. this place feels a little cold. its friday what am I going to do today?   sharon's or cullens place for sure. maybe downtown. hmmm. I have a paper to write my monday. I might want to get some sleep tonight and get a good start on it sat. its only two pages though. I better do a good job though. I have to read un redeemed captive this week to. I better thry and finish it sunday. I'm getting hungry. mexican food. taco C. hmmm. I might take a nap today. I want to work out today. I want to gain 00lbs before christmas. I need to work on my jump shot too. I miss playing ball everyday like I used to growing up. I'll go out to eat with eva at the texas club tonight then go play ball followed by working out. after that I'll be free for the rest of the night and be ready to party. I need to run a couple of miles to. I wondering how often you have to run in order to loose body fat. I wonder how long it would take me to get to 0%. 0 months? I'd have to eat right though. I wonder what it would take to walk on the Ut men's b-ball team. I guess I'd have to email someone and ask permission to play on the practice squad and go from there. hmmm. that would be great to work my way up there. if PROPNAME could do it then I could do it . huge maybe but I'd have to commit myself. kinda like when I grew up playing everyday. I like this root beer. A&W never fails to make great drinks. Amys ice cream sounds good too. I wonder what my room mates are doing tonight. sean is probably staying home and doing nothing and cullen might be getting together with some of his friends from back in high school. I want to go to killeen this weekend but I have way to much work to knock out. I miss my lil brother PROPNAME and sis caroline. I'll drive up there to see them as soon as possible. I wonder how my uncle joe is doing. I can't believe that him and emily are getting a divorce. they're only 00 and they have been married for 0 yrs and they seem right for each other. just goes to show what can happen to two people. you never know . dang that really bites because I hate to see my family break up. reminds me of my parents. and my dad. I wonder when the new lutheran service is. I need to get back into going to church. I belong there and I haven't found a church perfect for me in atx yet. I liked hyde baptist collegiate service. I'm not baptist though. anyways. I can't believe I'm going to be 00 in like 0 months. its more of a right of passage then anything. I still won't drink in public so its not that big of a deal but I always imagined 00 being in your 00s and a legal adult. I don't feel 00 though. that always seemed old to me. I don't think I have much time left on the writing assignment. hmmm. shrimp at the clubhouse tonight! I think I'm going to take  eva up on her offer and go with her and her family. 
__label__label1 I can't stop sniffling. I don't even know if that's how you spell it. I'm so pissed off that I'm getting sick. I guess that's what happens when you live in a dorm. I better not get some crazy disease though. I probably won't. Should I finish my homework? Or should I just pass out. I would prefer to do that latter. My bio 000 class sucks a lot of balls. The professor I think is just TRYING to sound intimidating, and if that is the case, then she is doing a really good job at it. Man, I really really want to be a doctor. I'm not as smart as everyone else. Things don't just come to me. I have to work for it. This may, in the end, work in my favor, being that if I(and hopefully I will)succeed, I will feel all the more complacent. But that's just wishful thinking. I'm really going to stop with the caring about capitalization. when I type emails I never capitalize my I's--well I just did. but that's different. there was this guy I one knew that always made me feel stupid if I didn't spell things right. I know how to spell. and I believe he knew I knew how to spell, but I think he took some kind of pleasure in my feelings of inferiority. perhaps, I will always feel that way when I am around him. well it hasn't stopped for about 0 years now. who would have thought that we would end up at the same university. I mean I know it's not a big deal, being that ORGNAME is enormous and all, but he is not going to escape me--I wish I want him to escape me. but I don't. that's not good at all. what a jerk. I mean ok, well he is not really a jerk," but I always feel like he is messing with my mind. maybe I'm just the one that's screwed up. I think I am. I'm really glad I didn't seem him today. I needed a break from all that. good break from it right? here I am in my "stream of consciousness" talking about it. I don't know if I spelled that C word write either--but who the hell cares right?        wow--I'm really glad it didn't push Finish on me there. sometimes that happens. that would have really sucked because I have already spent 0 min and 00sec typing this. I kinda like typing. it makes me feel pretty cool. thank goodness I'm a fast typer. if I wasn't, things like this would really suck. (I'm trying not to say 'suck balls') --now I'm laughing. I don't know where I got that expression from. maybe it was my sister. yes, yes, I have a TWIN sister. ohhh ahhh. a twin? does she look like you? are ya'll identical?  blah blah. yes yes and no. the end. if I spoke anymore about this and this is in some way published before the class, there would a better hint as to who the writer of this stream of consciousness is. it's alright. not that I mind. I miss my nephew. he is the cutest thing in the world. I miss when he would try to say "bob the builder. " what a cutie! he learned to say my boyfriend's name before he learned to say my own name--yeah I was a little upset at first,  but it's really no big deal. I am glad he has a solid man-figure in his life. the boyfriend's a good role model and he obviously loves my nephew very much--oops just sneezed. wow and sorry the phone's ringing. I can't be mean and be like hey I'm typing this stream of consciousness thingy. ok that's over, and I just realized that the spelling of consciousness has been at the heading of this page the whole time. I am a genius. beautiful. well I was spelling it right--that's good. man, sometimes I start to think in spanish. that's cool isn't it. I kinda like that. I wish I could speak fluently though. it would make things a lot a lot easier. I really do want to go to spain. it's on my list of things to do in my life, along with help others, become a pediatrician, and give back. I love my major. I'm so glad I chose it. we had a great discussion today about poverty and things of that nature. I am definitely a democrat but that doesn't mean I'm some liberal. liberals get such a bad wrap--it's not true. you know what else gets a bad wrap? jester. jester really isn't that bad. to me, when people complain about jester, they just sound really really spoiled. I know that's judgmental but oh well. I love how it's really social. that's how I met one of my really good friends here. we were in our HORRIBLE community bath --no it's not really horrible-- and that's how we met. she is really cool, from out of state. time's almost up. adios amigo. 
__label__label0 I am downloading stuff on kazaa. I've saved so much money this way. I need to make sure my grammar, punctuation, and spelling are correct. I have a basketball (plush) on my table, although I never play with it. Yeah, my web cam sucks. It's old. But free. My roommate is cool. He is sitting there doing the survey. I had a good day today. I want to go to the church next to PROPNAME. Probably this sunday. Yeah. Sunday sounds good. 0000 is my room number. I have a song stuck in my head right now. I can't remember the name of it. actually, I didn't know the name to begin with. Its a rap song. I need to charge my Palm m000. And take a shower. That would feel good. My mouth is dry. I need something to drink. Now I need to piss. It's really dark in here. This apple juice is not good for my teeth. I think there's sugar in it. Not good. Wow, it's only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. That sucks. I'm getting bored. I want to play some computer games. Too bad I'm stuck with this assignment. Oh, now I have a different rap song stuck in my head. I think I'm obsessed with them. I remember listening to this song a few hours ago before dinner. I was at my friends house if I can remember correctly. Humans are funny. I need to spend my taco bell coupon. Coupon or Coupon? I've heard it pronounced both ways. I wonder when my parents are going to call? Probably soon after 0? Or maybe 0:00? Haha, I just remembered something from dinner. My friend was taking pictures of girls with his phone camera. The asterisk looks like a snowflake. I noticed that I like to stand my chair up on it's front two legs. Well, that is if it had legs. It's more like a bar on both sides and connected in the middle. At least its comfortable, unlike the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Yeah. LOCNAME LOCNAME. I went on a field trip there. No, wait. It was LOCNAME on the LOCNAME. Maybe that is close. I don't know. I like the way you do it right thar. A line from the song I have stuck in my head. Geez, its been 0:00 only. Like I said earlier, this sucks. Damn, I'm typing too fast and my grammar is messing up. My speaker system and subwoofer rock. My hands hurt from typing so much. I should study more. I haven't even opened any of my books yet. Oh well, the weekend is coming up. I can do most of my stuff then. I hope I'm not going to be like this later on in the year. It's a bad sign. I hope I don't get lost in my homework assignments. I can't seem to find the Philosophy 000 website. Not good. Yeah. I got a nice view from here. I need to email my parents and send them more pictures. Awww, how sweet of me. I never realized how long 00 minutes can be. Wow. It's like. long. Yeah, anyways, I feel kind of weird talking to myself. Weird? Or is it spelled wIErd? I will have to look that up later. I'm sore from sitting like this. Well, I only have 0 more items on my download list in ORGNAME Lite K++. If you read this, get the K++ edition, not Kazaa, not Diet Kazaa, and not Kazaa Lite. K++ &gt; *. Yuuuhhhhhhhhh. I'm bored. I need to shower. I already mentioned that didn't I? Awesome, only 0 0/0 minutes to go. This sucks. It's boring. I'm not thinking of anything. My neck hurts. I don't smell anything out of the ordinary. I guess I got used to the smell of my room. 0 more minutes! I don't think I can last that long. I don't want to go to prison. Heh, it's not a confession or hinting at anything I've ever done. I'm a good guy. Yeah. Good. Maybe too good. Nah. 0 0/0 minutes to go. Wow, I'm really slowing down. This would probably take up 0 to 0 pages in ORGNAME Word, 00 point font, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's kind of sad how I can know this. I will test it out whenever I finish the 00 minutes. I also need to test out w(ei/ie)rd. SAT format baby. Yeahhhhh! 00 seconds! I think I will just wait it out. I'm so happy now. YAY! 
__label__label1 I just got out of psychology class like an hour ago so I thought I would do this paper while I am still in the thinking mode. I thought what pennebaker said about how students new to the college experience, like myself are under lots of stress. that is true. and how they are more prone to get sick when they go home because their stress is relieved. but I think I am sick right now because I've been coughing a lot and my nose is all clogged up. I think it's from the air conditioning in my dorm. but I'm not supposed to be sick now, right? anyways I've been here in austin for almost three weeks now and I have had lots of new experiences but I am beginning to get homesick. I miss my mom, dad, and sisters, and the city of houston. I am glad that I have friends from high school here that I can lean on. just ate dinner. it was really good and now I'm really full. my dance class starts tomorrow, can't wait for that. I don't like sleeping on the top bunk, don't sleep very well, been taking lots of naps. probably cause I stay up too late and have to get up early. lots of traffic noises outside. can hear buses. reminds me of when I got on the completely wrong bus the first week of school. I met a guy and have been hanging out with him. he seems really cool. I want to us to be friends but scared he might want to be more than friends. just adds to all the stress. I really need to be at the library studying right now. I think I will go when I finish this. just learned how to play racquet ball the other day. it's really fun, but very exhausting. I am so sore. also my legs hurt from walking around campus so much. I am really out of shape. everybody is concerned about the freshman fifteen but I really don't care if I gain fifteen pounds. it is highly unlikely since I eat like a bird, but I would be okay with the extra weight. I'm not going home until the end of september which means I will be going five weeks without seeing my family. I've never gone for more than a week without seeing them. can't wait to go home and see them and go to a pat green concert in houston. seems like not many people here listen to country music which is mostly what I listen to, although I do like other kinds of music. my twenty minutes is up. got to go! 
__label__label1 I REALLY DON'T KNOW OR THINK THAT I HAVE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF FINISHING COLLEGE. I FEEL SOMETIME THAT THE ONLY REASON I AM HERE IS FOR MY PARENTS AND FAMILY AND THE SATISFACTION THAT I WILL FEEL WHEN THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER AT MY HOUSE FOR MY GRADUATION PARTY. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT COLLEGE IS A OLD WAY OF THINKING. I FEEL THAT ONE IS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW A CERTAIN TRACK IN LIFE ALL TO OFTEN. WITH THE WAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOW AND THE WAY THAT JOB SECURITY IS, I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IN THE BELIEF THAT ONE SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE GET AN EDUCATION AND GO OFF INTO TO WORK FORBE AND WORK THERE WAY UP THE COPORATE LADDER. A LADDER THAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT BY PEOPLE WHO HAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW THAT IN MOST CASES COLLEGE AND THE EDUACTIONAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO TRAIN OTHERS TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE WORKERS FOR OTHERS. I FEEL THAT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO DO BECOME FINACIALLY SECURE AT THE LEVEL I SOMEDAY WISH TO BE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY THEN OTHERS YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE  NORM. THE REASON EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK YOU DON'T SEE TONS MILLIONAIRES IS BECAUSE ONLY A HANDFULL OF PEOPLE HAVE THE COURAGE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE NORM OF SOCIETY AND DO THINGS THIER OWN WAY. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT BRINGS ME THE MOST STRESS RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK THAT MAYBE ME THINKNING THIS IS A SIGN THAT I AM MEANT TO FOLLOW THIS PATH OF BREAKING OUT OF THE NORM. BUT AGAIN I LOOK INSIDE OF MYSELF AND WONDER IF I HAVE THE COURAGE MYSELF TO DO IT. I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES TO STEP OUT OF THIS NORM BUT FIND MYSELF RUNNING BACK TO THE NORM FOR SECURITY. I WONDER SOMETIMES IF THIS SHOULD THIS EVEN BE A FACTOR IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ONLY BEING 00. BUT THEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO I WOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE AND THIER LIFESTYLES AND SEE THAT THEY HAVE THE THINGS I WANT AT MY AGE AND SOME CASES EVEN YOUNGER. AM I IN FACT WASTING MY LIFE AWAY SITTING IN A CLASS ROOM FILLED OF 000 PEOPLE WHOS AMBITIONS IN LIFE MIGHT BE TO BE NOTHING MORE THEN NORMAL. I MYSELF CAN'T STAND TO BE IN THE NORM. I WANT TO GO MY OWN WAY AND DO THINGS THAT MAY BE A LITTLE CRAZY OR RISKY, BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS THAT IS WHY I'M WRITING THIS NOW. A SAD ATTEMPT TO FILL TIME UNTIL I HAVE TO COURAGE TO DO MY OWN THING. MAN WRITING FOR THIS LONG HURTS YOUR HANDS . I BET THE BEERS WILL KILL THAT PAIN. WHY DO I DRIN K EVERYDAY. IS IT BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE BETTER SEX AFTER I HAVE HAD A FEW DRINKS? I KNOW THAT IS WHY. I FIND MYSELF DOING THAT A LOT. WHY ARE WOMEN SUCH A BIG PART OF MY LIFE. IS THAT THE REAL REASON I WANT TO BE RICH AND FAMOUS, SO I CAN GET ANY WOMEN I WANT? WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT I CAN'T GET THOSE WOMEN KNOW. WHY DO I FEEL ASHAMED WHEN I TALK TO WOMEN NOW ABOUT MY MAJOR AND HOW I REALLY DON'T HAVE A HIGH PAYING MAJOR. I GUESS I COULD SAY I'M WAITING TO BE A SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT. WHAT IS THAT SMELL. DAMN MY ROOMMATE STINKS. WHY IS HE SO SHORT, WHY DOES HE HAVE A SEVERE CASE OF LITTLE MAN SYMDROM. I THINK HIS GIRLFRIEND WANTS ME. DAMN I SOUND LIKE A NIP TUCK SHOW GUY. THAT WOULD BE A COOL JOB. BUT TO MUCH SCHOOL FOR PLASTIC SURGEN. I REALLY NEED TO STOP DIPPING LOCNAME. I WONDER IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO READ THIS. IF THEY DO I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL THINK. MY ATTENTION SPAN SUCKS. I KNOW I HAVE ADD BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE TEST, BUT ILL TAKE THE MEDICATION. WHY DID I DO SO MANY DAMN DRUGS IN HIGH SCHOOL. HIGH SCHOOL MAN THAT WAS FUN. DRINKING BEFORE SCHOOL. XTC DURING SCHOOL . MAN WE WERE A CRAZY CREW. I'M HAPPY I STILL TALK TO LIKE 00 PERCENT OF THE OL BOYS AND GIRLS. ITS COOL HAVING GOOD FRIENDS , EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A FEW. I WONDER IF THEY LOOK UP TO ME FOR BEING ABLE TO DRINK THE MOST. IS THAT WHY I DO? THAKS FOR THE TIME. 
__label__label1 Hey what is up. Just writing my homework. I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction ". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those "teen movies" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 0 minutes 00 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 0 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 0 min 0 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 00 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 00 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, LOCNAME, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but PROPNAME is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in LOCNAME. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the ORGNAME would win only 0 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 00 min 00 sec. Today is Wednesday. 0/0/00. September 00 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 0/00 was a drug deal gone bad with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Heroin is a major export out of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. The LOCNAME Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the LOCNAME LOCNAME in 0000. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. PROPNAME is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 000. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 00 min 00 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done 
__label__label0 Okay so I was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. This was something that I really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and I seemed to have noticed a difference. I first tried it out on reading a book. I realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what I was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. When listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and I kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. I am listening to a dj named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is a trance dj, and even as we speak I can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what I am writing. Yesterday, last night, actually I was doing some reading and I started to first listen to hip hop and I kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because I know a lot of them. I ended up spending about 00 minutes and I got through about 00 or 00 pages which is incredibly slow. After that I decide to try out some trance. I actually used to always listen to trance last year when I would read or study because I always helped my expand my mind when I was either designing things, reading, or writing. So when I was reading I noticed that I was much more attentive to what I was doing and got a lot more than 00 pages read in a 00 minute time period. As of right now I am trying out this trance thing again. The funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. The TV  is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the TV  but to the work that we need to get done. After thinking about this right now I am at 0 min 00 sec and I have already written a lot. I believe that if I would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. Another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that I am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music?  I mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together? Or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body's response system that makes you feel all numb inside. Could this be another type of an anesthetic, but instead of a shot, gas, or gel, could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic?  Who really knows. But anyway that I am sure has been looked at for a long time. I really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me. But right now I really don't know what else I wamt to talk about because I am out of time. 
__label__label1 my room mate is listening to wierd music again. I have never heard of all these canadian bands. I really want to go to sleep. That would be so great right now. I can't wait to go home soon for the weekend. I would love to see my family soon since they are so fun. I really need a hair cut. I have split ends. There is a girl in our hall learning to play some sort of trumpet. She really sucks and I just wish she would give it up or practice somewhere else. I can't believe I have only been typing for 0 minute!  I really want to paint my dorm room. White is such a boring color. My suite mates got a beta fish this weekend. its a really pretty color. Better that the white of our room. I really want to sleep. looking at my bed makes me want to sleep. I can't even keep my eyes open any long. I have the longest, skinniest fingers in the world. I am also really not liking the fact that I have to read some much more in all my classes. I have 0 really cute cats at home. They are so fun to play with and cuddle. I really wish pets were allowed in dorms. I would so bring them up and then everyone in the hall would get to see them. I ran over my phone minutes again this month. I seem to talk on it a lot more that I realize. I am going to get a brain tumor by the age of 00. I really like the fact that I have gotten lots of mail since being here. All my friends have sent me mail. I got some today! Mail is fun. I feel bad though cause all my room mate gets is bank statements. sucks for her. Lots of people I know are in Psychology. They are all going to do this assignment too. I really can't spell well. Sorry if you are reading this. Well I think nothing really sticks to the walls in this dorm. I tried to hang curtains last weekend with this hook that was supposed to stick to anything and hold 00 lbs. But all it did was all and pull off a huge chunk of the wall paint. I can't get my pinata to hang from the ceiling either. I wander if anyone has been able to get stuff to stick?  I will have to ask around. I am the world smallest stapler on my desk. It was part of a dorm set I got for graduation. My friend who goes to ORGNAME gave it to me. I wonder what she is doing. I am going to call her when I am done with this. But I am over my minute, that is ok. I think my suite mate is doing the pretesting experiment. She is enjoying it too. I asked. I am going to learn to play tennis. My room mate is done playing her canadian music, but is not from LOCNAME. She is from plano os that is kinda odd. How did she ever hear about this music. I think I will get a beta fish too. They look fun and it would be something different to add to my room. But then I don't really like cleaning stuff so maybe not. I am so tired and my head really hurts. I need so aspirin. I need to exercise too. I ate too much for dinner. I like what I ate though. I got a catered dinner for free. What could be better- a nap. I wonder what my friends are doing. I got really good tickets to the football game- need to thank PROPNAME. Its dark out. That is a huge tree 
__label__label1 Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment. At least its easy, right? Oh well. I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am I going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. I really like this new piebald cd. its happy. I hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. I think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. I need to read more. especially for school. I just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. I'm tired, I should go to sleep. but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no 
__label__label0 I am thinking right now that this is kind of difficult. I don't want everyone to know my personal thoughts. I guess I have to do it anyway to make a good grade on this. I need to get everything done so that I can go home. I have to clean my room and do the psychology experiment, which takes a long long time. I don't know what to expect from it either. Oh well, it's required so I am going to do it. I can't wait to go home because when I do I get a snow cone. That might sound juvenile to be happy about something like that, but there are a lot of people who like them. I especially like pink lemonade with ice cream in the middle. I think I might get that. I always get it though. I guess I don't like to try new things. This is actually kind of fun. My friend PROPNAME is in this class too. Are ya'll going to take off for backspaces?  I don't even know if ya'll can see when we erase stuff. I am a fast typer, but I make a lot of mistakes. That's why I am saying that I erase. My friend PROPNAME also made me a cd. It's really good. It's funny because it has songs on it that apply to my life. Well not necessarily my life, but a boy in my life. I'm very confused about him. I'm not saying that he is gay. I just don't know what to do. It seems that I have been thinking and talking about him all the time. I e-mailed him and everything. I think that if you think about something too much it gets boring after awhile. You just confused yourself even more. What happened with him is that we liked each other, but I didn't know what I wanted from our relationship and so I guess I got scared. Now I don't know what to do. I always say that if it is meant to be it will be later. God is the only one that knows the future. That's what I don't like. I wish I just knew all the answers to everything. Man I just lost my train of thought. That's not cool. Anyway this writing assignment is pretty easy. I think it helps to get things out. We think a lot. Gahlee. My grammar is bad. Oh well, it doesn't really matter. Let me think of something else to talk about. Hmmmmm, I guess I can talk about my room mate. Maybe tell stories. Not bad ones of course. I'll write down how we met. I was really afraid that I would be shy at orientation since I was in high school. High school was crap. I wasn't made fun of and stuff. I was just ready to get out of there. I went to orientation and she was my roommate there because we are both in Preview which is a group that takes summer school and they pay for everything except for $000 of it. It actually helps you a lot. You get 0 hours of credit for $000 and you make a lot of friends. That's actually where I met that guy. PROPNAME and I got a long really well. It seems that we are exactly alike. That's really cool. She lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Well, she is from there she lives here. Ok so we met and I was pretty outgoing which is a good thing. I have changed a lot. I changed when I got here. I think that is weird because usually it takes me a long time to get used to a place. You get off track in these things easily. I was just thinking a second ago about how I went to my pal teacher's class and it threw me off. I thought of it because I talked about how different it has been coming here. My friend and I went to her class so that we could see her and she ended up making us talk about college. I miss Pals so much. It was a lot of fun just really difficult sometimes. It was kind of like Preview in a way. People could get in your business easily. I can't stand it when people don't mind their own business. That's funny because I am really nosey myself. Not in the sense that I like to learn everything about everyone's personal lives just that I am curious about everything. I really like this cd. She did a good job. PROPNAME, PROPNAME's b/f is coming to visit her this withe. I hope that ya'll know what b/f and withe mean. PROPNAME really likes him I think. He seems like a really sweet guy. The guy that I like is sweet too. I haven't even said his name yet. I guess I should but somethings need to remain private. Then again it's not like ya'll would know who he is. Awww friends are friends forever. I love this song. It's so sweet. Man my time is almost up that's not fun. I like doing this. I'm singing in my head. I would type that out but it would take too long. I wonder who else likes this song. 
__label__label1 As of right now, I'm pretty happy with my life. The only thing that I question are relationship issues. After breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 0 months ago, I haven't dated any other person. I think I'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend" lifestyle. The girls I have met as friends I might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they weren't, again because I missed having a girlfriend. Recently, I've gotten over the issue a bit. I've spent time with all my friends. That's the good thing about being single, you have more time for your friends. When I was going out for my ex, which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 0 years, I didn't have much time for friends. Not only that, but I chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends. This issue of mine, it's made me a bit more self conscious. I got the idea in my head that looks really do matter. Seriously though, having a "deep" relationship is important and yadda yadda,but I really do feel that looks matter too. A friend and I were discussing this. She is been there for me a lot. When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, she was there for me to complain to. Anyways, she said that looks don't matter and it only matters a small percentage of time. I argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that's what matters at the very beginning. I met this very interesting girl this summer. Her name is PROPNAME. She was telling me about her past, how she was somewhat of a "geek" in high school. She didn't care about her looks or anything. She is a very bright girl, very deep. Likes art and many things most girls just don't take interest anymore. She said that she realized she felt she HAD to start dressing up to attract people first, then and only then would they be able to see the "real" side of her. I completely agree with this. There is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow. Ever since then, I've gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features. I never did care about it much. I was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others didn't really enter my mind. During this recent period, I've started to lift weights a bit and work out my body. Another thought of relationships I've always wondered is at what point do you really have to "settle"? The reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl. When you date someone, how far into the future should you consider? Unfortunately for me, I should've realized in my last relationship that there was no future. Instead, because of my fear of being alone, I stayed with her. for nearly 0 years. It was fun and all, but we had many arguments. The reality was we were two different people. Two different backgrounds, interests, ideas, practically everything. My parents didn't like her because she wasn't chinese and wasn't very bright. (I'm Chinese by the way). I'd like to talk about my family for a second. I was born in LOCNAME, and moved to the LOCNAME when I was four. Thus, I speak/write fluent English but can only speak chinese(Mandarin) since I still speak it at home. I would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional, which I really like. Like most chinese families, my parents stressed educational when I was growing up. Sometimes I think this is why there is the stereotype of "asians being smarter in school". I think it's because traditionally, chinese families stress education a bit more than others. The bad thing about growing up in a "traditional" family is that living in the LOCNAME, I did not experience certain American family activities. My dad never took me fishing, camping, or anything "fatherly". I think that was one of the things I really disliked about him. Growing up, I always favored my mom more. Now that I'm in college, I talk to my dad a lot more when I go back home, including cars, sports, politics, etc. Going home, I'm spoiled with food. My mom is always thinking I'm going to starve to death. Everytime I come back up to LOCNAME, she makes me bring a whole bunch of food. My grandparents(dad's side) also lives very close to me in LOCNAME. My grandparents came to the LOCNAME a couple of years before us, which is how we were able to. I remember growing up and laying awake at night, my biggest fear in the world was that I'd lose my grandpa (to old age). It's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever. We've tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him, but he just won't. He says he has nothing better to do during the daytime, and to let him enjoy it. He is even said something close to "I've already experienced everything in life. My family is doing good. I have nothing else to live for" Now, don't take this to be a suicidal comment for anything, he was saying it as if it were wise words. On my part, its hard to argue with him. He is my grandpa and I can't really tell him to just stop what he likes so much. Personally, I have a very big problem with talking to people. This problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college. Since there are so many people around, it's hard to not get use to it. When I'm around people, I'm always worried that what I say will make them think negatively of me. That's why I'll usually always rethink what I want to say in my mind before I actually say it. Funny thing is, my chinese name translated to english is "brave speaker". I know I have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but I just can't help it. Growing up I didn't have that many friends, so I thought to myself a lot and that's still true. Around strangers, I'm really quiet. Only around friends am I a bit more active. And my 00 minutes are up. This was pretty useful. Glad I could type out what I was thinking. Now I got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book. The lectures are much more interesting. 
__label__label0 I forgot that we were going to be timed, I wonder if we have to type well, I wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. This is kind of harder than I thought. So should I go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? Oh well, I don't think I will. I'll just keep going. I need to keep typing about something. I need to type what I'm feeling. I'm feeling a little stressed because I have to keep typing all this time. I wonder how long this should be, especially if I have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. It's only been three minutes. Geez! I thought this was going to be an easy assignment. Well, it is relatively easy. It's just different from what I expected. I wonder if sarah and Christen have gone to bed yet. I never know how late they stay up because I'm always. oh my phone is ringing! But I can't pick it up because I have to keep typing. Oh well. They can wait. I bet it's PROPNAME. I still haven't met him. But PROPNAME said he wasn't even that cute. He is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. I need to call PROPNAME and make sure we can all go out on Friday night. My shoulder is sore. I wish I was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. That would be so nice. I can't believe I ate those ORGNAME's Treats cookies. I hate that. It takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. But then I just come home and waste all of the calories I burned off on cookies. I wonder why I get those cravings for sweets. I keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. I'm running around the track in such pain. I really hate to run. Well, I guess I don't hate it. It does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. But while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! It takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. I wonder who is actually going to read this? I hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. I don't know if that even makes sense. PROPNAME, my friend at ORGNAME wrote that today in her email. I have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. I feel that way mostly because I lack the. see I can't even think of the words. I lack the ability to think of the words. The bottom line is I need to work on my vocab because I just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike PROPNAME. However, I did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while I was getting my school supplies. I realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. But then ironically when I finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, I couldn't find them in my dictionary! I never look words up because I just lacked the motivation and then when I finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! It just goes to show that I can try but I'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. Maybe I need to read more. I need to read the newspaper everyday. I hated hearing that I had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. My neck still hurts. I need a massage. I would love to just get massages all the time. That would be so nice. I only have two minutes left. It feels like I haven't been typing for very long. I think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. I still can't type very fast. almost done. 00 seconds. wow this is a long 00 seconds. 
__label__label0 right now, I am in a really good mood, I don't really know why because this morning I was so dead, and I thought I would feel like that all day, but I woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but I was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. I don't know how people do it every night!  I am so worn out every day!  I just need to take a few days off to sleep. I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  I have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and I really need to go running, so I hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder I think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. I really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else I would have never woken up. and I really miss my dog. I think I have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god I'm taking psychology. haha I literally miss her more than my parents!  I hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. I always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. I would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! I was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder I was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like I wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and I think that's awesome. sometimes I wish I could be more like that. I am a fairly independent person, but I know I follow the trend a lot too. I hope I do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! I miss dance so much!  I can't believe I quit - I am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when I quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully I can start back up. I seriously think I've gained the freshman 000!  for some reason when I get stressed out I start to eat. a lot. I need to get control!  I think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. I love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. I think I'm kind of in between. I love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!?  he used to be so funny and nice. I wonder what my sister is doing right now. I miss her about the same as I miss my pooch. she is so sweet. I hope she is okay. I worry about her all the time, I just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. I am the complete opposite!  I spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. I know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :(  I really need to stretch. I think running will be good for me today. I need to burn off some steam for sure. I wonder how molly is doing. I haven't talked to her in awhile. I feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and I was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when I call, so I hope she is at least having fun. I bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't I find a guy?  they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which I am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't I get my first choice!  I really want to know what I did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and I am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did I spill my guts that night about it to nathan. I am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run! 
__label__label0 It's kind of weird writing about what I am thinking of right now this moment. there is not clear direction what I want to write about. I hope my english is good enough to make a sense to my TAs. well, I am really hungry right now. Maybe I should ask Bora to go to LOCNAME with me and have dinner. I just love that place. I think it is the best fast restaurant in LOCNAME. Well I did remember seeing the news column with PROPNAME is voted as the best Fast Restaurant. " I think it was the LOCNAME local newspaper, because I can not remember the name of the newspaper. By the way I really should start reading the newspaper more. well I wonder if Doctor PROPNAME is gay or not. He really is funny guy, but today's outfit really was more like cloths that gay people would wear. I really think that he need a exercise. He can loose weight around his stomach. Well I really shouldn't criticizes him with the weight because I know that I really really really and seriously need to loose a lot of weight. I should start swimming again. And bring my old swimming suit from home. I can not believe that I forgot to bring it to school. I really want to go home. I wonder why mom told me not to come home this weekend. I know that I need to find the ride and everything. but This sunday is her birthday and coming up monday is unni's birthday too. I wonder "Don't come home honey. It's too much trouble to you. " means like " Oh yeah come home!" kind of deal. sometimes I don't really understand her. I hope I would not be like that. well this time thing is really going to slower then I thought. I should have ate first. Man I have only dome 00 min. umm now 00min. ha ha. yeah just 0 more minutes. well let's see. I should be worried about the psy class too. Man the class is too long to stay a wake. and chapters are too long. I feel like I'm reading the whole new different language. but It is fun. I wonder how tough his test is. man I really do need to catch on the reading. (I really will go read after chipolet if you are reading this. ^_~)         Let's see what else am I thinking right now. I really can not think of it any more. Ahhh man this pop-up ads. why can they just leave me a lone. I mean really nobody reads the whole think. man that must be the PROPNAME. Boyfriend of my roommate. they are just cute couple. 
__label__label0 clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it. - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it. hmmmm its 00* degrees celcius right now. that does not even really matter, I prob. won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something. spike tv. what kinda dumb sh** is this. this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv" - 00 minutes is a long time to be typing. I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are. better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out. is that possible. yeah. school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point. I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico. I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was. where do all these "personal type surveys" going. is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools. if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid. hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions. I think that job would be pretty boring. I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy. that is prob. why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing. I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity. that would suck. it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was "mentally handicapped". I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else. its crazy to be alive and conscious. consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation. joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy. I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. I can't really think of what to say. I need a cigarette to calm me down. that is not even how you spell "cigarette" but spelling is not even that important. I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar. but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled. that kinda shit pisses me off. need a smoke. 
__label__label1 I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done. I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist. My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to LOCNAME, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment. We went to the Arboretum and looked around. Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind. This whole not working thing is really different for me. For the past 0 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff. But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 00 hours and just not work. So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out. My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school. There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas. PROPNAME' b-day is Dec. 00 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents. In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of PROPNAME' skiing trip as his Christmas present. But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for PROPNAME, I would just feel weird asking. So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money. Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal. I thought about ORGNAME which is literally 0 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 0am) shift. There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning. So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon. Ok well now what do I write? I have 0 more minutes left. oh some good news. My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio. He's won a car, trips to LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME (all paid for trips of course), probably 000 tickets to Six Flags and Sea World separately, and so many concert tickets you wouldn't believe it. He's just really good and always has about 0 radios going at the same time, all on different stations. Ok well I just realized that I only have 0 minute left so I guess I'll wrap things up. I do wan to say that I liked this assignment very much and that we should do all of the. bye.      
__label__label1 A steam of cousiness paper is kind of a weird thing to do, but in a way simple. At the moment all I can do is think about this paper and the impression I am going to make by putting down what I have to say. Will I sound smart, dumb, or  am I completely doing the wrong thing. Oh well I guess there is not to much I can do about it now. I almost waited until the last minute to do this and I was afraid that the system might be backed up or something, just like the prescreening survey. Wow!!! I waited until the last minute to do that and I was sitting at me computer for just about 0 hours. I guess that proves I procrastinate pretty often. Sometimes when events like this happen I try to fix the problem and I do good for awhile. For example I won't but things aside and and do things sooner than later, but after about a week, I am back to my old habits. Today I actually got stuff accomplished, but then ageing I didn't because, here I am a couple of hours before this assignment is due, trying to complete it. I am hoping that my internet connection won't crash or some other phenomenon, such as bad weather, won't affect me turning in this assignment. Thing of bad weather made me thing of all the unfortunate events that have happened due to the hurricanes in the LOCNAME area. Bad weather, such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, is something that really frightens me. I think it is really a big fear of mine. When I hear that a tornado might be in the area, automatically, I thing the worst and am afraid for my life. I guess I just wouldn't want to go that way. Although its not a popular way to die, like cancer or drunk driving, its just scary to thing about. But after all the destruction in LOCNAME there haven't been to many deaths reported, a lot more than there should have been. This is a very serious topic and never thought it would take me to this. I just hope the situation clears up soon and the areas recover as soon as possible. Recovery can sometime be the hardest thing to cope with and get through and that goes with any kind of recovery. Such as when you get in a wreck and have to recover from that or even recovery from a long night of partying and drinking. That requires a different type of recovery. my fr      
__label__label0 I really miss PROPNAME. she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how I don't have my cell phone here with me. my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail Saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until Monday and I wont get it until Thursday before I leave to go to LOCNAME. I'm drawing a blank. how am I supposed to write for twenty minutes when I'm struggling to think of something to write after only two. I guess I shouldn't think so hard, should I. is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway. I'm really enjoying this psychology class. I thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it PROPNAME is actually a really energetic professor. I like that. it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us. kind of reminds me of Brink, my science teacher in high school. he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us. I do not know one person in ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME or one person who came through CHS and had PROPNAME that didn't like him or his approach to teaching. I miss him. I miss high school. college life is really overwhelming at times. Right now I'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy. I partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone. Oh nikki couldn't handle that big school. She got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there. Look at little miss I'm smarter than you back in LOCNAME. I guess it was lonely up there on her high horse. I have to be a success and that is why I have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester. it is so important that I become somebody. I can't stress that enough. I refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves. its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so. My family is a bunch of nobodies and I hate to say that. Well in an educational sense of the term. None of them went off to school in order to better themselves. but then again I can't really blame them for that. I mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance. I'm here on financial aid as it is. its not easy walking in my shoes. some people think I have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges I had to overcome to get here. it was not an easy road to tow. I been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of God. Speaking of God I miss PROPNAME and ORGNAME and Tristan. I only wish that I had more time with them before they left. especially PROPNAME. He was and still is my baby. I love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me. they could have left but why him. I remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when I first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no. that was my little boy. I love him and miss him like  you would never understand or maybe you would because I'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine I loved him like he was. 
__label__label0 I am worried about my brother, PROPNAME, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, PROPNAME. We sang a lot, which I love. I'm not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in LOCNAME. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because PROPNAME and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won't let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I'm done with this. PROPNAME and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, LOCNAME, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around LOCNAME alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called "How Could I". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 00 pages long. I didn't get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won't get much sleep tonight either. PROPNAME has music playing in the background right now, but I don't know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven't done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I've moved to LOCNAME, I've really missed dance because I don't have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the "hook 'them" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I'm really tired, but I won't be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the LOCNAME in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in LOCNAME. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. LOCNAME is beautiful. The LOCNAME area especially. I'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  
__label__label1 I just clicked the go button for this writing assignment for psychology and I just almost misspelled psychology. It is amazing how I can't spell psychology and how I still stumble on spelling it on the keyboard, psychology, I just did it again. At the beginning and before this page there was a precautionary note that said if people were insecure about their confidentiality. It is just an assignment, what could possibly go wrong. The teacher or TA will steal your identity! If they do they some students should sue. That is weird. I can't believe I just wrote that. I am writing this assignment now because I have some spare time and the writing assignment is due on Friday. I do not even know when I would have done this assignment. I have free time because my computer science class was, I guess canceled. I hope it was canceled because I hate missing class. It feels as if I am missing some knowledge that is necessary for my brain. I hate when I am unsure if class is actually canceled. Added to that, I hate when people are still in class sitting in the room waiting for class to start. Those students make me uncomfortable because it seems as if they know (they don't) that we actually have class. I am in the computer lab typing this writing assignment and I do not know what else to write about. Let's think. I am thinking. Okay, I am in the corner, near corner of the computer lab and I am typing. Oh yeah, speaking of writing assignments, my architecture writing assignment is going to be difficult because my TA wants us or prefers that we use LOCNAME style in our papers. When he asked us if anyone did not know how to use LOCNAME everyone was quiet and a huge pregnant pause was present. It is weird that teachers still do not understand that if students are quiet when they ask a question, nobody knows the answer. It is weird. I am now thinking if I am even doing this assignment correctly. It seems as if I am "tracking my thoughts" of this past week. I hope I still get credit for this class. I don't even know this class is hard or easy yet. Maybe I should reply that girl who mass emailed everyone and say that we should start a study group. A study group would hopefully help me learn more about this subject. I hope I can pass this class because as much as it is interesting I don't think I can sit through more of the same demos or demonstrations. The experimental requirement is pretty cool. I am almost done and I am happy about that. I don't have to write a 0 page research paper. Yeah!  Writing research papers can be a hassle. Calculus is progressing fast and I am sort of surprised that I am grasping the notes real well. I am understanding Calculus, weird. Even though it is my major I still think that I should be able to be better than what I have been doing for that class. Thirteen minutes and whatever seconds, is how long I have been typing so far. This is sort of getting tiring. I wonder how psychologists interpret this writings. I can't wait to read what the explanation for this writing assignment is. I think it would be cool if one of our tests was just writing this kind of stuff. "Write what is on you Mind for 00 minutes". That would be weird. It would be a completion test grade, which would be cool. I think I have 0 more minutes,  and it is weird that I said 'think' because I can not subtract and I am a math major. Well my calculus professor said that he has problems with simple arithmetic also so I am not that worried. It always reassures me that teachers/professors have the ability to forgot simple things like that. It makes myself better. I can't wait for this timer to be over. I am waiting and I am just typing stuff down. I have 0 minutes left so when I am done with this minute I will have 00 seconds left. So, yeah. Time is dwindling down. I wonder how many people are doing this assignment right as I am doing this assignment. What will I do after this. Oh yeah I have to read for my next class. Wait! I have to read for this class. I can't believe I for got, I need to read for this class after my music class. 
__label__label1 this is getting really old this is my second time doing this because the page keeps shutting down or going back and I have no idea what's happening to my other writings. so now I'm getting really annoyed because I have other homework to be doing . I also have to do the prescreening because I tried doing it last night and the computer kept crashing. I'm watching the sandlot I remember this movie from when I was a little kid me and my brothers would always watch it. they always tried to make me watch PROPNAME PROPNAME and I'm so scared of him. they used to dress up like him and have his mask and hide in my room at night. they were pretty mean to me. now that I'm gone I miss them so much. mayra and john keep arguing and whispering stuff to each other and I wish they would stop they make it so obvious that they don't want me to hear. I hope I don't have to start over again because that's going to make me so mad. I'm going to the incubus concert next week and I'm so excited the only thing that sucks though is that I have a test on Monday in this class and also my precal class which means I have to hurry up and study and not slack off. I don't want to be one of those students who mess up at the very beginning of their college years and then wish they wouldn't have. this timer is going really slow and I'm getting really sleepy I didn't go to bed until six in the morning. I was up watching videos and eating cereal today is PROPNAME's birthday and instead of me buying her something she bought me a glow in the dark wish bear. I thought that was very sweet of her but I feel bad because I have no idea what to get her for her birthday she has everything that she could possibly want. were going to go eat at red lobster on Saturday and were going to the movies to watch wicker park. I already saw that movie this weekend but I liked it so I want to see it again. it was about a girl who becomes obsessed with this guy. I wonder why people become obsessed with others I mean does it have to do something with their brain or is it just lust and they want to get their way. I hope I do good in college I don't want to mess up. I'm not even sure what I want my major to be. I was premed at the beginning and I still am but it seems really difficult and it needs a lot of determination and hard work. I know I could do that if  I really wanted to but I want to have a life outside of school and it seems that's all that doctors have time for, books and work. so I'm getting really hungry and my head is starting to hurt john and mayra are still arguing and I don't like it at all. I feel bad when people argue because I feel I should try to make everything better. I know its usually none of my business but I like to make people happy. all of my friends tell me that's a bad quality because I never end up doing what I want. but the thing is I don't want to hurt anyone especially those I care about. I feel like I'm hiding so many things from so many people but they would never understand me and plus I don't want to disappoint them. I know that if they really loved me they would understand and be happy for them but I'm not sure I want to take that chance especially if I don't even know what's going to come out of it. I'm probably not making any sense right now and I wish this would hurry up because they are really getting mad now and I'm using johns computer so I feel like I'm using him and mayra is getting mad at him and he is doing me a favor by letting me use it. they left the TV on a baseball game and I don't want to watch that. I need to go and check in with my job because I need to start working already. I'm running out of money and I don't want to ask my mom for money because she has bigger things to worry about I just want to make it on my own and make her proud. they are all doing so much for me to be here that I don't want to make them doubt why they believe in me so much. I really want to go home and watch TV and fall asleep and forget about everything that's going on right now I feel like pretty soon everything is going to crash and burn and its going to be all my fault and I'm going to be left with nothing except regret. I regret not being honest with everyone right now but I'm just trying to take things one day at a time. hopefully everything will get easier and make more sense because I have no idea what I'm going to do if it doesn't. I hope that everything that is happening is happening for a reason 
__label__label0 It's a bit past 0 pm on a Sunday, and I only just woke up a while ago. So here I am, writing a psychology paper which has no definite topic as such. I usually listen to laid back electronic-type music when I do papers, which is what I'm doing now. I feel it helps me free up my mind, and help me think more clearly. I don't know how this paper is going to end up, or whether I'm writing what I'm supposed to, but I suppose that's the point of the exercise. So - tracking my thoughts. Well first off I just realized how annoying the timer at the top of the page is. Watching it tick away while thinking of something to write (which shouldn't be a problem anyway since I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking and not the other way around) just seems to get on my nerves a bit. I wonder what the rest of the writing assignments this semester will be like though. They need to fix this page up though, it didn't work in my primary web browser, Mozilla Firefox, and I don't like Internet Explorer all that much. Oh, the music just changed, it's a bit faster and slightly more aggressive now. I got myself some candy too, though I probably shouldn't have since I'll be having lunch in a bit. It's getting a bit warmer in here, someone probably increased the air conditioner temperature again. And now my roommate is playing basketball outside in the living room. One of these days I think he's going to break something. 00 minutes and the clock's ticking. I really should get some work done today. I pretty much wasted the last two days, but hey, what are three day weekends for? I've got some Math and CS homework, as well as a freshman seminar paper. Math's an interesting class even if it is too easy. Not to sound self deluded, but I do think I know more calculus than most people in that class, at least so far. Computer Science is a different story though. The class is a bit harder than I expected it to be, but nothing beyond me. A little googling and I should easily be able to look up anything I don't already know and complete the assignment. Java isn't really one of my strengths, but that doesn't mean I can't make it one. I like psychology though, at first I thought it would be impersonal and intimidating because of the sheer number of students in it but that's changed. 00 minutes. I just have to continuously keep looking at the timer. And the music just stepped up, now it's a bit faster than before. And I actually got this paper done! I'm so proud of myself!  well, not really, but I'm glad I got it done anyway. And now my mind's a blank really. Looks like my time's up. Did I mention I hate popups? Time to click the finish button. 
__label__label0      How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework. This week is going to be pretty busy. It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. All the teachers should use the same service. This would make it much easier for students to keep up. My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology. I need to find out what I missed. That class is going to suck. I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away. I hate writing. I hate typing. It is hard to write down everything you think. Our minds work 0 or 0 times faster than one can type or speak. So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 0 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. I'm glad my spider bite went away. It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it. They gave me a shot in my ass. It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. It just sucked that it was on my face. It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days. Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. I spend much time alone now that I moved away. Luckily I enjoy being by myself. It is nice to have the peace and quiet. The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know. I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played. I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. It seems barbaric to use ones instincts  
__label__label1      This summer has been such a burden on me. I am dwelling in it and it is eating me up. I don't know why exactly we broke up I just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected. I find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me. I just can't seem to let it go. It might be because we were together for so long and go so close. She was the best person PROPNAME had ever put in my life. We seemed to click, it seemed so perfect, and she told me she felt the same. She told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes. She was scared. She told me I meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her. She had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me. Something she hadn't let herself do with anyone else before me. It felt so right. I was at such a high, life was so good. I was happier than I had ever been. I became so dependant on her for happiness. I know that is something that was unhealthy, but she had gotten just as dependant on me. We had so many plans for the future. We planned out every step of the way. Factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school. Everyone is telling me to move on, but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us, for me not to let her go. She wanted to get through this hell or high water. Nothing was going to tear us apart. During the summer we got closer than ever. We had many plans for the summer. We bought tickets to concerts. Then she went off to camp. She said nothing was going to happen at camp. Four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me. What the hell happened at camp. I go to Warped tour and she with someone else. All I can do is give her a hug and say "Nice pick over 0 feet tall and blonde, just like I said. " Seeing as I was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same description. Later she calls me and tells me it wasn't what it looked like. I blew up on her. It was a normal reaction. Everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring, and then BANG, everything comes crashing down. Everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there. And I completely defended her. Cause I knew her better than anyone else, not only my thoughts but hers as well. She was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past. Every male figure in her past had let her down, and she couldn't comprehend someone loving her as much as I did. So because all the idiots in her past, I have to be let go because she can't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together. Why did she have to go, we were happy. I don't know what happened at camp. It was more than seven weeks ago that I talked to her. I called this week and left a message she didn't return. I called again today. She picked up we talked for 00 minutes and 00 seconds. She seems perfectly happy, just as free as a freaking butterfly, not caring at all, it seems, about what I am feeling. How is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and I'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable. Is everything that has happened a game to her. I don't understand how I can move past this. I can't. I don't what to do. I gave her everything. And it feels impossible to get it back. I still love her more than I love anyone, including myself. All I can do is sit and write songs about it. 
__label__label0 At this very moment I feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what I see everyday. For example, there was a notice on my apartment door that I read after coming home from school. It stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex. about 0 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby. When I ride the Ut shuttle busses to school, I notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets. everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency. I don't know why I get angry when I think of this, maybe I pay too much attention to things I shouldn't. I have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational. enough of that. Now I am beggining to think of all the things I must do. I feel rather confused because I don't know if I should quite my job. It is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 00 hours a week as a waiter at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. On top of that, I just moved from apartment complexes, and I have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment. There is an empty Burger King bag infront of me and I feel guilty. You see about 0 year and 0 months ago, I used to be very fit, I mean I had it all. I'm 0 ft. tall, and during that time, I weighed about 000 lbs but out of pure muscle, I was scorching hot. That is around the time I meat my girlfriend (I hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and I just ballooned into 000 lbs. The reason I stated earlier that I felt guilty for eating the burger was because I am trying to get back in shape. And I also feel bad because I know that my partner worries about my health. But I do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices I've made in my life, I chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also I have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.       
__label__label0      hello professor, I'm doing your little writing assignment even though I have no clue what to write so Ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head. today I have to do a lot of study work, not much else to do b. C I lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 0 hours and now I'm in the UT cycling team and its pretty damn cool. I should excel in this sport because I know how to push my body harder than anyone I know, no matter what the test I always push my body harder than everyone else. I want to be the best no matter what the sport or event. I should also be good at this because I love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport? wow lots of fun. music. hmmm I like it a lot, I have lots of it in fact I have about 00 GB of music on this computer which is about 0,000 songs so I have a wide variety of music and that's good to have, its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what I do, I know lots of stuff that nobody else would know. I am extremely good at jeopardy and I usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is, they have had college and lots of schooling, most of the contestants were graduate students and I have just begun college. by the way my classes are in no way difficult, I hope your class doesn't get hard because I have a a lot of calculus which isn't hard, just very time consuming. what to write, haha now that I ask an opportunity has presented itself, a girl that I know just said hi, got me some of that last weekend, I've known her all my life and she looks pretty good too, she goes to tarleton(redneck city) but its ok, its still good. I have a way with people, if I can talk to them for about 00 minutes I can get them to really like me and if I want to I can make them do almost anything(no alchohol has to be used). you can ask my best bud who goes to school here, he knows that I have a way with people and I do that's what's so cool about this. I have a great life ahead of me and I want to live it to the fullest and no matter what I say on here I can't stop typing so I will continue and the music is great by the way damn I've got to go home this weekend, everyone misses me too much although I don't miss any of them except this girl that I went out with for bout 0 years, lots of fun there, I love her yes I do and she loves me but since I left we broke up and now she's trapped with a druggie b. C if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she's very scared but I don't care, it will all work itself out in time I just hope it won't take forever. my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject, he has no body mass, he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now, as in extremley good, I wish I could click it right now but I can't b. C my 00 isn't finished yet so I will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted, geez 00 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although I have writted letters that have taken me 0 hours to write and consisted of about 00 pages of paper, but I don't care, I don't care about much anyways, just my grades got to keep them up, I care about my family my future and the girl back home, I care about my frineds, I care about my physical health and looks that's why I love to be in shape but other than that, I don't care about much of anything, there is no reason to care and by the way I SUPPORT PROPNAME he is a good man and if the media didn't give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people don't is because of the media, I even ask them why they don't like him and all they can say is just because, I reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously BUSH!!! anyways I don't really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all, music is a beautiful artform wchich I believe is the best ever but who cares? nobody. I am out to change the world and I will you will see  --Mad Hatter--out 
__label__label0      I love my girlfriend leah. She is so awesome. I love her big butt and her hair, I love her tongue and her smile. Man oh man does she give good hand jobs. Almost as good as sex. ALMOST. there are some things I don't like about her though. She is a tiny bit chubby but it doesn't really bother me that much. She is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves. I also worry that she is a shopaholic. and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income. I wonder what I will be doing 0 years from now. it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj. I think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time. I believe that would be best, cause then I could stay up late still and sleep in a little later. the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too. I would have fun being the dj in the morning, but I would hate the hours. I mean whoa, not my kind of lifestyle. I also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out. I haven't been really an active gym goer. I need to start doing that. I am trying to think of what would be a good time to go. on mondays I could go right after class at 0, same thing goes for wednesdays. on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays, I should probably go right after Spanish, because then after I am done I could go eat something, that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that I wouldn't have to eat before I go to Spanish then. I could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday, Wednesday and friday. and then weight train on tuesday and Thursday. maybe I should do the opposite. cause then I could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out, plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time. now about tennis. I really hope I can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice. I should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things I need to do. it would be cool if leah and sara came to UT next year, unfortunetly I don't see that happening when it comes to leah. I wonder how long I should wait before proposing. I think waiting til at least my junior year would be best. because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship. I mean two years is a long time to be with someone, and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together. no wait they were actually 0. 0 years I think, maybe 0. 0 when he asked and 0. 0 before marriage, I don't know, whatever it is. the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money. I could probably go back to ORGNAME cause I mean they don't pay that poorly. possibly even be a CCM or something so that I could bring a little extra dough in. I would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station. I wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show. I should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if I could get some kind of spot in there. even if it wasn't a show, but a technical thing. okay so when it comes to homework what should I do so that I have somewhat of a schedule. if I sleep in the mornings, or at least plan to, I don't think I should try scheduling that in. what I should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure I get hw done first before I do anything else. because then I could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldn't be too bad. cause that's probably my problem, the fact that I don't go to sleep early enough. I want to go to midnight rodeo this Saturday, I just wish roger creager wasn't playing there. remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later. back to study. monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all I have is my writing class EASY, and Spanish, so getting out late on those days isn't too bad. Tuesdays and thursdays I should try to make sure I am done with hw by like 0, cause then I could go eat after I did my hw. that's a pretty good plan. only on occasions should I change that up. what I mean by that is like being invited to do stuff, never let it be online poker or TV that distracts me, that includes playing xbox. even if I think I have had a hard day so far, just think how more satisfying that resting will be once I have everything done, I mean knowing u don't have anything left to do is a nice feeling. this writing this is going by faster than I thought. I didn't know I had all this stuff on my mind. I think it would be nice to have a 0pac on my body, and some muscle. you know, it really does kind of upset me that leah doesn't want me hanging out with females alone. I find that it shouldn't matter. I mean on one hand I know her past, and I don't want to upset her on something as small as this, but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal. maybe I should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this. HOPEFULLY we can compromise. I am kind of tired but I really do need to study for Spanish quizzes tomorrow, and I should look over chapter 0 for this class. I wonder when the first test is, I think it is on the 00th. that's coming up pretty soon. I should look at that handbook thing I have on sample test questions on this friday. along with that I could reread philosophy and study some more Spanish, and go to a seminar for writing class. this was kind of a fun thing to do. I kind of like having a diary like this, helps me think clearly. 
__label__label1 WELL, I FINALLY GOT TO MY WRITING FOR PSY. I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TODAY OFF. MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 0:00 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 000.      MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME. THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR. MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW. I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW PROPNAME IS LOCKED IN JAIL. EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T. PROPNAME IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE. THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND PROPNAME IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 000 YEARS AGO. SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC. SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ORGNAME. IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 0 MINUTES. 00 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY. I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY. I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME. I MISS IT. THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE. LIKE ORGNAME, ORGNAME SPORT, ORGNAME ORGNAME AND BLACK MARKET, ORGNAME. I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS. I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 00 IN THE AFTERNOON.       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER. HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO. I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT. I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME. I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY. I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE. I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON. WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY. IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND. 
__label__label0      I wonder if he is going to call me tonight. I wonder if he cares or if he just wanted some. I hate guys like that. why do I always fall for a guy and just end up getting hurt. PROPNAME must really not give 0 shits about me. I gave him all of my heart and he just broke it. why are guys like that. I hope my cat doesn't hurt my hampster. do rats really not get depressed I wish I was a rat I can't handle being depressed anymore it seems like I will never be happy doesn't anyone care about me I just want someone to love because I know I have so much love to give. I wonder if I like manny or if it is just a fling. either way I had fun with him. I probably shouldn't have stayed with him those nights but I enjoyed it. I wish we could be together right now. I wonder what he is doing does he want me or what. I really just want someone to want me. I don't want to be alone anymore. I have so much homework I have to do. if I don't  do better then I will be kicked out of ut that can't happen my parents will be so pissed  I need to make a's in all my classes why can't I do it am I really stupid or what I just want to be happpy is that too much to ask for.

__label__label0 I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. PROPNAME, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see PROPNAME, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where PROPNAME decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where PROPNAME PROPNAME's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to LOCNAME this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. PROPNAME came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with PROPNAME, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to PROPNAME and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 0rd floor. We started talking about PROPNAME's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw PROPNAME's ring (which is her grandmothers, PROPNAME did not buy it), PROPNAME told me that it was 0. 0 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose PROPNAME either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. PROPNAME just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, PROPNAME is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 00,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with PROPNAME for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with PROPNAME now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in LOCNAME LOCNAME, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   
__label__label0      So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind. Which is not a good way to start off the school year. I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. First, I am taking ORGNAME 000M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. Then I am taking ECO 000K with an amazing professor. I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study. I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is PROPNAME PROPNAME weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP000K which is a community service class. We have to do community service every week for at least 0 hours. I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. This class should be interesting. I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. This class is just something I need to take. Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  PROPNAME seems very laid back and cool. With the music at the beginning of each class, etc. I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year. Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 0. 000 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party. I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now. I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. So hopefully Ill get my act together soon. Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting. That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha ORGNAME Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her. Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '00 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha. PROPNAME, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha. I always seem to have boy problems. But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess). Anywho, there is this one boy who is a ORGNAME Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is PROPNAME who I kind of talked to last semester. He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks. I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him. And he's 00 (haha). But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone. I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. But then again I don't want to lead him on and then "break" his heart. Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). He is super cute and very interesting. I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him. I think he could teach me a lot about life in general. Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with. So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast. Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. Then there is PROPNAME who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better. So we shall see how things go. I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 00 minutes. I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast. This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade. Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now. This weekend is our first home football game which I am very excited about!  We play LOCNAME LOCNAME and we should whopp some beee-hind!  I can't wait~ 
__label__label0      Wow, I haven' sat down and typed for 00 minutes in a long time. I guess we will see how it goes. The first thing on my mind is how great living in an apartment is. I love not having to deal with anyone such as parents, siblings etc. The main benefit to this is being to sleep late. Today I woke up at about 0 p. M. and didn't hear anyone tyring to wake me up like when I am back home. Anyways, life seems to be treating me preety well right now. I still miss my girlfriend, but I try not worry about it. I had become too dependent on her and I think I lost a sense of myself a little bit. Now I have plently of time to find myself again. The football game this week was a waste of time. I left in the second quarter when it was 00-0 because the sun was beating down right on my section and it sucked all energy I had right out of me. But, we won, so I'm not going to complain about that anymore. I just looked at the clock for the first time and its only at 0 minutes. It feels like I've been writing almost 00 m,inutes already. I bet its because I'm still tired. After this I'm going back to sleep for 0 or 0 hours and then I'll wake up and do some laundry. I hate laundry,but I guess it has to be done. I've let it pile up like and idiot and I probaly have 0 or 0 loads to do today. Let's see, the three day weekend was great, and what makes it even better is there's only 0 days of school until the next weekend. The more I think about the nap I'm about to take, the more drowsy I get. I absolutley love naps. There's honestly only a few things better than being able to sleep whenever you fell like it. The best time to take a nap is when you hae nothing to do and need to pass some time. Like after this. I know that's probaly not the best mentality to get the most out of life,but its not the worst. If I need to stay up, its no problem. In fact I'm tempted to just hit finish, go sleep and come back and do this but that would be just plain stupid. My apartment is a mess right now, but I cleaned the other day and my roommate had friends over last night, so its his turn to do some cleaning. I'm looking forward to some cold weather, because I can't stand sweating when I walk to class, which is what has happened about every day. Ok, four more minutes. I could do this all day and I'm sure eventually I would say or at least of something useful or interesting but I don't think its going to happen in the next 0 minutes. It sure as hell didn't happend in the last 00. But that's okay, because someone doing assignment is writing a great paper. In high school we had a english that made us do this kind of writing. Except we had to do it 0 times a week for a month. We were studying transcendenlism(sp?) which I personally is all b. S. Anyway we were supposed to find a quiet place in nature, go there every time a write for 00 minutes. I didn't go to my place one time and made up the entire project the night before. My grade:00. 
__label__label0      I am thinking about how to write this paper. I can't think of what to write. PROPNAME is putting papers in her notebook I am typing the ring around te logo is blue. the ring around the logo is blue. someone just entered I would rather be playing music. PROPNAME says goodnight 0 minute 00 seconds. I'm sort of hungry. I think writing this makes me more hungry. I have so much homework to do and other responsibilities. I wish I had no responsibility at this point in time. I'm worried about psychology because the content seems too easy to take a test on, suggesting I'm understanding the full realm of the content or the full realm of my responsibilities in this class although philosophy is worse. I cannot imagine being tested over anything in that class. Astronomy is just about the most difficult class I've ever taken because it's pure physics and not really learning about the general properties of celestial bodies. I've got a block. I need to write more songs, I haven't been able to write fully in over a year. but I could never be nearly as good as the ORGNAME so it seems frivolous to even try. water I'm beginning to drift off. I really need to do my homework more often I have way too much. I need a cellphone. I think I'm the only person in LOCNAME with no cell phone. everyone assumes I have a cell phone. I can't even get long distance jessica just stuck her finger in my mouth. she didn't think I'd write that. or that. I'm almost halfway through. I'm sleepy. my girlfriend is sexy. PROPNAME offered to be her tutor. I'm running out of things to write about. the ORGNAME are the best band ever. bar none. they incorporate obscure time signatures and lyrics into the most influential sound ever, the only quesionable exception being the Velvet Underground. they were copied by many bands yet don't get credit for it. listen to PROPNAME's "The Sweater Song" and the ORGNAME "I Bleed". PROPNAME was even on their tribute CD. No coincidence. listen to any Nirvana song compared to any ORGNAME song. Nirvana usually gets the credit for creating the modern alternative genre, but it was the Pixies. the liars are pretty awesome too. same with fugazi. and the desaparecidos, even though bright eyes is conor oberst's creative offspring. but the best up-and-coming band is the unicorns. they're neat. 00 00. it's already nearly 00 o'clock. I don't want to go back to my room because my roommate is boring and I'll miss PROPNAME. and he'll want to go sleep when I come in, like he was waiting up for me. this is hurting my wrists. Party on the Plaza was a little dull. I realize that I can't truly ever write what I'm thinking because that requires me to give a physical aspect to something that isn't physical and the true meaning of what is being said is restricted to restraining par  
__label__label0      I love the movie Dirty Dancing. it is just a great movie. got to love patrick swayze. I got the crest white strips for my birthday. (not sure if it is an insult yet. Hehe)and they are pretty great. kind of make my teeth sore. But there is a price to pay for beauty. speaking of beauty. I burned my face! that makes me laugh. I was trying to use a curling iron, and got my fae instead. yep. What better than a burnt face?wow. Only 0 minutes have passed. Insane. I fell asleep at 0 in the morning yesterday because I am neurortic(or however you spell it). see. Over the summer I began watching queer as folk, and only got to the beginning of the second season, and at the moment, the show is in it's fourth. so. Having the luxury of high speed internet, I went to the website and caught up on the 00 episodes I have missed. and for every episode there were two video clips. And needless to say, I watched them all. it was amazing to see whathappened with the characters. they changed so much. I kind of hate watching shows because I get so attached to the characters. I feel they have an obligation to me to do the "right" thing. maybe that is why I am addicted to the young and the restless. I have been watching this soap opera since I was 0. Not Playing. kind of like a family tradition. my mom passed the torch on to me, and to this day I still record the show! I can't get enough of it. My brother tells me I am neurotic all the time. so I have a funny way of doing things sometimes. Doesn't everybody?. I like to eat the skins of pickles but only dill pickles. And I don't like to eat the seeds or membranes of a jalapeno. So what!. He makes me laugh. wow. Only ten minutes so far. Twenty minutes is a long ass time when you think about it. But not when you are watching a show. my mind goes to PROPNAME now. The "man" of my dreams. known him since sixth grade and never really got oever him. I think I think about him out of habit now. Who knows. He got me a dirty dancing poster for my birthday. That was incredibly sweet. my birthday activities revolved around dirty dancing. went to see the mr. Sinus people make fun of the move I love dearly. it was damn funny I'd have to admit. patrick swayze is fantastic. I would marry him right this minute. Well maybe not. I would marry "johnny" right this minute. I feel lonely. Never had a boyfriend. I know why. But we won't get into that just yet. probably never. I just want someone to think I am special. Someone to think I am cute. someone who will go out of their way to see me or just someone who really understands me. Wow. kind of makes me want to cry. I am a big brave dog. hehe. just a phrase me and my best friend use when we feel a little weak. the older I get the more I think about these things. wanting a companion. wanting a boyfriend. makes me feel unusual not having one. Never having one. but who knows. Maybe I will meet the man of my dreams tomorrow. Highly doubt it. But anywho. I find that now that I have less time. I want to get more out. This is very helpful. I wonder if I am pretty. From time to time I think I am, but then I see myself on an off day and realize why I have never had a boyfriend. I like john ritter. Love jack from three's company. would marry him in a heartbeat. maybe my standards are too high. I don't know. I know why . But that is another story. can't believe all this just came pouring out of me. Strange. I thought this would be difficult. I like this. A lot. I love the dirty dancing soundtrack. What a wonderful movie! there is none better. Maybe Hedwig and the angry inch. But dirty dancing will always come first. patrick swayze was my first love. if you can call it that. first one who mademe cry. 
__label__label1      Today is the first football game, I'm pretty excited. Idon't really know the drill so  hopefully my friend willcall.

I wish I  could be like that but at the same time I'm having fun I guess, I really miss griff, he  always made me smile even if it was something stupid, I need to go visit him at  atm I wonder how much different it is over there if it really is a bunch of cowboys  like I picture it I wonder if erin likes it since she's not into the whole spirit cowboy  thing, I think she would do so much better here with me! plus I mjust miss erin. she  was so cool I loved our no pants parties, they were fun bonding time. man 00 min  is longer than I thought suck town usa, I think this assignment is kind of cool to track  your htoughts for 00 min, it just proves further how random I am, I'm hungry, I think  I'm going to have a pb&j when I'm done, that's the stuff with strawberry jelly. strawberries whiten your teeth that is so cool I need to start using my crest white  strips again, I need to take a shower, man I forgot how far away kirby lane isthat  power walk made me all nappy. that's ok I'm sure ill get even nappier at the f-ball  game amin is so hot, man did I luck out on getting a counselor, nate was so cool  too! I'd totally date nate. that's the kind of guy I'm looking for, random funnyness  facial expressions everything someone that canjust make me laugh up a storm. OTherwhise ill get bored. I kind of want someone like griff though too. Although if I  dated griff I'd be really scared. Idon't know why, idon't htink he'd ever cheat on  anyone but he never wants a girlfriend. manhes good. really strong. he can bench  press me that's amazing I need to work out I don't want that nasty freshman 00.

I  wouldlove to get a really hot italian boy. man that would be cool. like hardcore  awesome. like paolo or davide or vincente that would be awesome this takes a  long time I'm having trouble trying to fill up the time I wonder when my roommate is  going to wake up its like 0:00 in the afternoon. PROPNAME take a nap I think I will. naps  are the greatest. I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome. especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool. I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad. good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 00  min and 00 seconds. sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 0. 0 at least my mom made a  0. 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time. I never really realized how hard she must have worked. its  college that makes you realize stuff like that 
__label__label1      I'm home. wanted to go to bed but remembered that I had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week. Maybe this wouldn't take that long. I can handle this. Something is making a noise in the restroom. Did I turn on the fan? I got to write more. This is harder than I thought. I'm not thinking anything. Was I always like this when I didn't have anything to do? Should I go to bed after finishing this assignment or should I stay awake. I think I had an appointment with someone. Or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in. Is there any assignments besides this. My roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now. Wonder what he did with it. I'll ask him when he comes back. My eyes hurt. I should really do something about my glasses. When should I go fix it. ? Feel tired. I should really go to bed. Only 0 minutes passed. Half way done. Wonder if I can just stop here. Maybe not. Hm. let's see. What am I thinking? Wow my feet are covered with dirt. Amazing I didn't notice that until now. How did I get this on my legs? I want to wash it off but I'll wait until this assignment is over. 0 minutes to go. What are my parents doing anyway? Hope they're doing fine. When would they be able to receive the email I sent few minutes ago. Anyways, I feel like I really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was. Guess I'll figure it out after taking a nap. Am I still not there. Never knew how long a 00 minute could be. Thirsty. No water around. Now I'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make. Time is almost up. 
__label__label1 my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy. I came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me. I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was. I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one. don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy/simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 00 years of there life online and I believe it. there is just so much to do online. I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that. I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so I totally love LOCNAME LOCNAME, she is such a riot. I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. I want to read it, I think it will be amusing. on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them. I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth. I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. I never realized 00 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. I hate that. how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity. I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it. however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. I have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. I hate how little kids are so fat today. I wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat ANYTHING. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 0 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 0 cokes a day. crazy crazy. I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. I can't imagine it not being computer timed. I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere I guess. I'm so hungry its not funny. I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored. I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. I'm quitting this at 0 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 0 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 0 min before 0 and that should be even. I feel like I started this at 0:00 hmmmmmm I can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. I don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life. I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time. I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom. ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 0 minutes and counting. 0:00 will be the new time for completion. 0 more minutes. and I'm stumped. I don't know what to type/talk about. ooooooo 0 minutes and counting. ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . Times up.
