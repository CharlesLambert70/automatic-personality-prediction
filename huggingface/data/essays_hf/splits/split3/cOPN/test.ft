__label__label1 Ok. Here we go. Well I really don't have much to say right now. I've done this type of writing before. It was a strange experience. All I ended up writing was the lyrics to some song I couldn't get out of my head. I just kept going over and over again. Don't you hate that?  I especially hate it when it's like some obnoxious song that I only know the chorus to or something. Hmmm. Right now I’m wondering how in the world I’m supposed to keep on typing for twenty minutes and keep on coming up with things to say. It's kind of like when you meet someone new and you're trying to have a conversation with them and you keep hitting those brick walls. I constantly do that. You can only ask a person their major so many times. I wish I would have taken a typing class in high school. Everyone else I know did but I procrastinated so I could only take a programming class for my computer credit. But it was good that I took that class. Now I’ve learned that I really do hate programming. I have to come to terms with the fact that I like computers yet I hate programming. I think my brain would slowly build up pressure and then explode when I’m in my 00s if I became a programmer. My typing skills are atrocious!  I think I’ve been out of practice. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing?  She's my roommate and she's sitting next to me. She always gets a lot of e-mail, yet she complains regularly that no one writes her. I like get nothing but that could be because I don't write anyone either. Oh well. I think if I got into the e-mail habit again, I would waste way too much time in the computer lab anyway. Oh no. Mind block. This is kind of like writing a letter to your closest friend. (which I also haven't done in a while. )  Just say whatever an who cares if they care or not. What are you guys going to do with this information anyway??  I missed the first day of class so I really don't know how this stuff is going to be used. I've always been afraid that if I ever went to a psychologist or something, that they would end up telling me that I’m nuts or something. Or they would know something about me that I really don't want them to know. And there's a lot of that kind of stuff. Everyone in this room is staring blankly into the screen of their computers. Isn't it amazing the power these little boxes of silicon and metal have over us?  Imagine our world today without computers. (apparently I actually learned something from my comp sci class here)  If one day all computers just stopped working, we would all be screwed. The world would go haywire. I would go nuts. And don't limit it to the computer in the traditional sense. We're talking the little computer chip in your remote control or in your light fixtures. Everything. Hey. that would make a good story. I bet it's been done before but I think I just inspired myself. That'll be my second movie. Did I say I wanted to be a director?  Well I do. Now I have three ideas for my first films. I really can't wait. I need to go out and buy some books. I've been running out of things to read. I love books. Actually I have a new favorite author. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That reminds me I need to look him up on the web. I wonder if he's written anything else??  I hope so. "Vurt"  was one of the best books I’ve ever read. Well, times up. :) 
__label__label1 Hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper. I hope you really really  enjoy this one after all ORGNAME other ones you have read. Anyway right now I am  really excited because I'm just about to go to the ORGNAME ORGNAME the ORGNAME concert. I'm hoping that I have a blast and I know I will. My brother and a  lot of my friends came up for this concert. So, I will be able to see them. AIN'T THAT THE GREATEST THING. Earlier today, I was wishing that I could fly. The reason for that is that we  were stuck in traffic. Just think about it, just flying through the air, your hair flying back, brushing across your face--but I guess if we could fly, we  wouldn't think that much about it. Yesterday, I got an e-mail from my sister. It was really COOL and all, and she should come visit me soon. My sister is the one person in my family that I  really enjoy--but enough about that. I'm going to a concert, and to party!    Oh, just to throw something in here. I was noticing that many people here get  really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the  morning. I think this is really hilarious because I come from LOCNAME, LOCNAME. That is a border-town to LOCNAME (not that it could be LOCNAME in LOCNAME). Well,  we have clubs and discos in LOCNAME that are just a few minutes away so I'm  use to going out, staying out late, and drinking. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have  fun during their high school years--whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves. That is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in LOCNAME, and why a lot of students struggle just to pass.  I hope pass all my classes with A's if possible. I'm planning to be a plastic  and reconstructive surgeon, and I kind of need a great GPA to get into ORGNAME  ORGNAME. Oh by the way, I want to clear up the reason why I want to be that  kind of a surgeon. Many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money. Some people don't even consider doctors as real doctors. They are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay  young and beautiful. Although plastic surgeons may do this, they help build up the self-esteem of the patient. There are some people who were born with  defects or were in a really bad accident, plastic/reconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again. Most people with some type of defect  usually have a low self-esteem. Therefore, they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people. Plastic/reconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world. They feel better about  themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is improved. This is vital to  the survival of the individual--for without it there is nothing to live for. Well, I'm going now hope I didn't bore you too much!  :>                                                                                            
__label__label1 Well, here I go, writing for 00 minutes. This really feels weird, but I  guess I have to do it. Actually I am glad I am doing this assignment because I dreaded doing it and now I can get it over with. It's just that 00 minutes seems like such a long time to sit here and write about nothing. I just don't know what to do and I feel very uncomfortable. Hmmm. Princess PROPNAME died early this morning. I have felt so sad. When I first heard of her car accident last night I tried to pray for her, but I felt as she would not want to live but rather die. I have been reading and studying about near-death experiences and most people studied/interviewed have said that they usually do not want to come "back" after being pronounced dead. Anyway, I think she is in a better place, hopefully there will be no media hounding her wherever she is at now. The ceiling fan in this room bothers me when it is on high. Sometimes I'd rather be hot than have to hear the loud roaring noise. My dogs just came upstairs. I wonder what they are thinking about?  Do they think like we do?  What could be going through their minds?  I know I am supposed to write without worrying about grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. , but I do, and I try to correct everything as I go. I keep looking at the clock and time is going very slow. I notice we have two clocks now on the desk. One is new, a prize or rather a gift for purchasing something. This room has so many things in it. I wish it was a bigger room. I like spacious things, I hate to feel crowded. I seem to be complaining so much right now, I guess I am tired and a little sleepy, and get grumpy. Why do we have some many things!  So many papers, junk, wiries, toys things, things, things!  Do we need all these things?  Can we live without all this things?  Yes, we can! Thank God! I can't stop writing but I would like to. Oh well. I just thought about a bakery, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME bakery to be exact. I keep craving sweets, so maybe that is why. I saw a white cake with pink frosting. My sister also came to mind. Hmmm, this is interesting because she is a professional baker and creates luscious deserts!  It is so dark outside, I hate having the windows closed, I like to hear the outdoors. I love the outdoors. Oh God 0 more minutes of this. I just feel like my mind is completely empty right now. I wonder if this happens when one is really tired?  I feel very old today. I like this computer, I guess I am pretty lucky to own one. I'm sorry I have been so negative, but this is how I feel right now. However, my time is up , hip hip hooray! Bye!  
__label__label0 My neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. I went to PROPNAME and the lab was closed, that stunk. I'm very tired because I did not get very much sleep last night. Some girls on my wing and I were going to go to some Frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. It turns out one of my roommate’s friends is also in this psy. class, I thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. I haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at LOCNAME, I really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. The ORGNAME are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!!  I worked for them for about nine months, so I am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 00 years or so. I was able to get him a bluebook autographed by PROPNAME PROPNAME for Father's Day this year!  I really enjoyed giving that to him I love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!!  I love to make people happy and some people think I'm crazy for that, but I think it's great. That's another reason I have enjoyed my intern ship with the ORGNAME so much. When I get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the ORGNAME will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. Let's see 0 more minutes of writing. My roommate and I were talking about our special talents, I told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!!  Yes, if I walk down LOCNAME, I WILL fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 00 people that happen to be walking by!! That is something else, hey!! I just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. This is a man who says he cannot send me $000 a month, but can take a two week vacation to LOCNAME LOCNAME and buy a new car in the same month!! Anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 0 more minutes of writing, I can handle it, hey I'll bet you can tell I'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! Well it sure has been great talking to you. And as our good friend PROPNAME would say: Goodbye and good luck.     
__label__label0 Wrecks. They are the worst things ever. I can't believe princess PROPNAME died  yesterday. It shows that anyone can die at any moment. Of all people, a  princess, a mother, an internationally known woman, a philanthropical figure  in this world. It's sad. Yesterday I was running down the street to pick up  an anklet for a friend and I saw a wreck happen. it is scary. luckily no one  was hurt but it could've been alot worse. The anklet was awesome though. I  kind of wish that the one I bought was like hers but that’s okay because I got  an even better one later on in the day. I had to sit for almost an hour to  wait for the police to come because I witnessed that stupid wreck. and then  they didn't show so I just gave the girl my name and phone number and then I  left. I have better things to do, like eat. The food here really isn't that  bad. I haven't been eating from much of a variety though. Everyday I eat  from a choice of about four meals. I can live like that though. My roommate  is really starting to bother me. I should have known this would happen , but  everyone always thinks "that will never happen to me". Just like getting in  a car wreck, getting pregnant, or getting a disease like aids or something. I hope I never get any of those things. I don't know what I would do. I'd  feel like such a failure. It does happen to so many people though. And  everyone deals with it in a different way. to each his own. And everything is  just fine to me just now. no need for me to change my life,  I have my friends , my boy, my studies, my sorority, and my own life here in college. Being away  from the parents is such an amazing feeling. just the fact that we are proving  to ourselves that we can do it on our own. feed ourselves, discipline  ourselves, control ourselves, wash our laundry and all that stuff. I’m doing  okay. but I know for a fact that not everyone has been handling themselves as  well as I have. I am me and I am okay. 
__label__label0 today I called up some of my friends from LOCNAME (where I’m from) and we all went out to the drag. it was sooooo nice to be able to kill time, since it has been going by so slowly. I am so tired from walking all day. at least I found my exploring psychology book at bevos. I want to get fake nails put on tomorrow. my mom said that I could buy whatever I wanted, but I feel bad spending the money. oh well, at least I’m not doing anything illegal. I am so excited about rushing for that Christian sorority. I really want to make some lifelong friends here. not just some people who only care about themselves and what they're going to wear tomorrow. I wonder if it's true that a huge majority of psychology majors become shoe salesmen. great. I’m here getting homesick for nothing. I’m surprised that there are so many people talking outloud here at this computer lab. I thought I would be the loudest one here by simply opening my backpack. I wonder if it matters that I’m not using capital letters when I type. I’m sure it will be fine. I am so thirsty. since I've been here I have already finished off 00 bottles of water. at least it's helping to keep my skin clear (knock on wood). psychology is so interesting. I wonder what my stream of consciousness says about me. who knows, I’m probably sending off signals meaning that I’m going to be a psychotic weirdo when I get older. I like my necklace, but I feel like I am wearing a dog collar. it looks so tight on me; I have a huge neck to begin with. they say that the first sign of aging on a woman is when her neck wrinkles. well my neck has quite a few. I really like this computer. my keyboard is so annoying. this one has keys that write so smoothly. I hope I've been studying enough. I really need to get over the idea that college is extremely hard and requires absurd amounts of studying. I’m doing just fine!  I’m really surprised that I have so much to say. I thought I would be sitting here trying to impress whoever's going to read this by using really big words and coming up with impressive thoughts. I guess I was really wrong. I forgot my glasses in my dorm. I hope I’m not damaging my eyes by not wearing them. these girls sitting beside me are really getting loud. it's really getting annoying. all of a sudden they quieted down. I guess I’m sending off bad signals to them. I really feel like brushing my teeth. for some reason I've been brushing them an average of five times a day. it's probably some type of stress release or something. I wonder how my friend PROPNAME is doing back home. she just left to LOCNAME this morning. I wish I could have gone home with her but I really need to duke it out here. I can do it!!  what am I going to do tonight?  probably study or something. I hope my roommate decides to stay in our room for once. I guess I like my space though. my mind just went blank right now and I don’t have anything to say. I really admire the older people who come to college. I wish my mom would. she deserves it. I hope I am that devoted to my child. I don’t see how someone could give up so much for someone. I know I would do it for her, but just the fact that she has done so much for me already is amazing. I wonder if animals go to heaven when they die. I really think they do. it wouldn’t be fair to me if they didn’t. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing back home. I hope he is having a fun time. I’m so lucky to be here. I wish I could give back to someone else. maybe that volunteer organization will call me and ask if I want to help out. I definitely would jump at the chance. I need to go to the rec center and pick up an aerobics membership. I hope I’m not gaining weight here, but I guess I will find out when PROPNAME brings my scale back up with her. I better not be gaining weight, because I spent an enormous amount of money on a personal trainer. what a waste!  I hate it when people ask me what type of music I listen to. I really don’t know what to say because I don’t listen to very much music. I’m so glad I’m getting this assignment over with now so that I don’t have to rush to do it at the last minute. I need to go back to Mezes to sign up for some of those experiments. I hope there are some slots I can fill up. I’ll bet that so many people are going to end up writing a research paper just because they'll put of going to sign up for the experiments or because they don’t show up to participate. what a waste!  maybe I shouldn't talk, because I can just see that happening to me now. I wish I was good at math. that would be the ultimate!  I've been typing for twenty minutes now, so I think I’ll sign off. I’m surprisingly sleepy!  you all probably wont read this until a few months from now, but I just want to say thanks for such a wonderfully convenient assignment :) I hope I’m not too weird :)))) 
__label__label1 Philosophy. can one truly think that one knows nothing?  If one truly thinks that one knows nothing, doesn't that mean that he in fact truly knows something. that he knows nothing. If God is omnipotent can he make a rock so heavy he can't carry it?  God. If he were the perfect God why hasn't he made himself present to the entire world?  How can this world think so highly ORGNAME itself that it thinks it has found the right religion already. Maybe the true God has never been seen, has never been thought, has never been written down before. There always exists the possibility that perhaps the world came about in a way no one has every thought of before. It's possible and very probable. Can one truly put all his faith in God. If God is an almighty, omnipotent being, can one put his entire life into God's hands?  But then God says not to be foolish. Is it foolish to want an explanation. Maybe the confusion is meant for a reason. Have to get an application to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. To be a genius wouldn't be so bad. It wouldn't be that great either. Everything has its ups and downs, black, white, heaven, hell, etc. Perhaps the goal is to reach a true balance. Maybe then we'll be content. Then again to be content and balanced you would have to have some discontent. Fashion is definitely too emphasized in this world. When will comfort be in?  It will probably take off like a forest fire. People will realize there are plenty of more important things than clothes and appearance. Of course that doesn't mean stop bathing and wearing dirty clothes. People need to get priorities straight. Why waste your time taking a speeding ticket to court. Time is money. Time is more valuable than money. Without time we are nothing. Without money, we are without money. Time will never wait nor come back. Smurfs. I remember Smurfs. Back in the childhood days when things weren't so complicated. A tiny blue creature was simply a tiny blue creature. Not a tiny conniving blue wench searching for self promotion or upholding a social image or making the extra buck. It was a time of snowmen and berry fights and rope swinging and rock climbing and tadpole watching. Nothing more, nothing less but perhaps invaluable. 
__label__label0 This is the first time I have ever had an assignment like this before. I have never had to use the internet before, either. I wish that the computer in my room wasn't so difficult to hook up to the UT internet system. I am so tired of going to the same computer store over and over. First, they managed to sell me over one hundred dollars worth of computer equipment that I didn't need. After, that was sorted out, I had problems with the Ethernet card. Oh well, I will ask my boyfriend to fix it for me. I am so glad that he lives in LOCNAME. I am glad that my best friend is my roommate. We always get along and we never fight. It's great because if she wasn't my roommate, then we would have a huge phone bill. So far, everything about UT is as I anticipated. I really didn't believe people when they told me that I would  have classes with over two hundred people. That came out to be half true. I only ended up with twenty or so in my English class and about one hundred and fifty in my biology class. My chemistry and psychology class end up in the same room. both are enormous. I didn't even know how to spell psychology until about three days ago. Whenever I wrote the word I always looked at the course schedule or at my textbook. Books are another problem. The co-op had the wrong listing for my biology book, and I had to go through a huge hassle to get my psych book. I shouldn't be complaining. I really love it here. I love being one in fifty thousand. I love being known as only a social security number. The atmosphere is so relaxed and go with the flow. "  I think that I am adapting well. Twenty minutes are up. s       
__label__label1 Right now I am having a weird feeling in the lower part of my stomach. I'm not sure if I just had a bad lunch or if it may be something a little more serious. I'm kind of sad too. I talked to my family earlier and I realized how much I missed being at home. Last night I attempted to meet some new people despite the fact that I am just not the social type so I am kind of down about that too. I hate walking up and down the stairs and stuff here at u. t. I can't stand the heat. I mean I am from the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME but I never had to walk EVERYWHERE. I hate the food in Jester. I know I wasn't supposed to talk about this until my second assignment, but right now college controls most of what I am thinking right now. I forgot, keep typing, keep typing. In a sense this stream of consciousness isn't as relaxed or real as one might assume it may be. A lot of the thoughts are a little forced because you would have to put your thoughts into words. That itself isn't too natural. I am not a computer person either. I guess it could be worse and I could be an EXTREMELY slow typer as well. Phew. You know, this isn't so bad. It's kind of fun. This assignment simply requires that you ramble for twenty minutes. It's kind of quiet in here. I just realized that. My fingernails are really short. I wish they could be a little longer. a little more feminine. One day I wake up and they are on their way to getting long and the next day I wake up and I've either pulled on or bit them. Even though I am not really the social type, I have managed to make some friends. yea for me. this guy in front of me looks like he's all into his homework when I bet he's just e-mailing his chick back home. Even though I just used the word "chick" I am not sexist. In fact, I  hate that word. I'm not exactly into all this equal rights stuff. I think it is okay for men to play the macho, take charge role in society. I mean, women are, as an entirety , weaker. So what if we are the ones who play the nurturing half of the species?  We have our strong points and so do men. It balances out. Every once and a while you get a person who is stronger in a different and/or unnatural area, but that is fine with me too. There are a lot of computers in this room. While I typed that I had another thought but I can't type 0 things at once so you just missed out on something. of course it wasn't important so who really cares?  bop bop bop bop my brain stopped throwing out ideas just then. My friends are sitting to each side of me. I haven’t talked to them since I started this assignment so it feels weird. Oh, wait. I had to talk to one briefly about why this thing typed all the way down to what seemed infinity until it returned to the next line. She just told me to wait. Everyone says you gain fifteen pounds when you get to college. I hope that is not true because I already feel fat enough as it is. So, have you sat down for twenty minutes and tried this assignment?  How did it turn out for you?  This is a pretty big screen. Pretty big, indeed. I'm pretending to type fast. I hit keys and everyone probably thinks I'm on a role with what I am thinking, when in reality I am just pretending. Crazy, huh. Wouldn't it be weird if I just snapped and from here on out everything I thought was as random and crazy as this. this isn't a personality profile is it? You aren't going to call me in some time and discharge me from UT are you?  I guess this isn't what you had in mind for stream of consciousness (I don’t want to spell it takes too much brain power) but I hope its kind of what I was supposed to do. I am one of those students who is always scared of turning in assignments because they might be just plain wrong. I'm really tires of typing. I just read what I typed "I’m really 'tires' of typing" that's pretty stupid. at least I know I am not one of those people who thinks a bunch of bad words when I am freethinking. Or at least I don’t think about sex or anything. Well, I did talk about men and women and equal rights so I guess that kind of applies. When I play with the keyboard it sounds kind of like a horserace. Try it, it does. All you have to do is establish a rhythm. My fingers hurt still. I wish I was really fluent in another language. type, I don’t want to type. type I don’t want to type. believe it or not those words just took the form as a song in my head. I cheated. I just talked to my friends sitting next to me. I BROKE. again. I think I went a little over but this has been kind of fun.   
__label__label1 I really don't know how to use the Internet and I have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant I am. I really wish that I did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like I will really have to use it in medicine. I wish my dad would subscribe t o the Internet at home. Oh well at least during the Christmas vacation I probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. I wish my dad had not held me to that deal, I mean what if I flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. Forget the car I just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the Christmas holiday just incase I fail. You know I am really scared what if I really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get  into medical school and I happen to fail, what if I became a doctor and all my patients died on me will I be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. I really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so I can see what courses I should be taking and when I can fit them in so I can graduate in four years. You know what this is a stupid assignment because I am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. Mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. You know if I had been a braver soul I would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. What kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to Mrs. whitenight I cant believe I didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, I suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. I mean really since I suffered and improved each and every day in her class I should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what I could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score It sounds really silly, but who cares I don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and You know Mrs. PROPNAME should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair I mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. This is almost over thank you God I never want to do this again but I have to. Yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad I cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing I have friends like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I still haven’t talked to PROPNAME and I could  not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from PROPNAME the nerve of her trying to steal my major. I mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to PROPNAME she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than I am. I can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction I am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and I can get me a tutor so I can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. I hope I beat enough so that I graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( I could care less). PROPNAME is a cool roommate , I sort of getting a little tired of jean I mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend I hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. Today I am supposed to start jogging I hope I can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself I think. I know I have to call my parents I am especially worried about my mom I mean ever since the death of Princess PROPNAME she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone I hope she gets over it soon. I hope when I am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, I can't believe PROPNAME and PROPNAME got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift I have received from anyone since I got my ORGNAME' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that  was the last birthday I got present from my parents at all. You know in the two weeks I have been here I have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because I think I was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. Maybe I'll see him during the Christmas holiday maybe I wont maybe I'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way I shouldn't be thinking about that right now I'll think about it later when I am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really read this its not embarrassing I just don't feel like having anyone analyzing my brain waves or my mind thinking pattern, I would rather be analyzing someone else myself. I wonder what the projects are going to like I hope its going to great well I have to go so I can eat lunch which I have never wanted more than right now. 
__label__label1 I woke up this morning and I'm thinking. "Where am I?"  And then I realize that I'm at ORGNAME. I was so upset last night because I left after class got out at  0:00. Then everything went wrong. The trolley cart fell off the steps and all of my stuff went crashing to the ground. I got in my car and the needle was  practically buried to the red empty sign so I stop to get gas, then I decide that I had better eat something because as soon as I get there everyone will be ready to go out and I will be starving as usual and afterward no one will want to stop and get poor little old me anything to eat. And boy was I right. PROPNAME says it will only take and hour to an hour and a half to get here. Yeah right. Try two and a half. Someone goes off and gives me the wrong directions that takes me all the way to LOCNAME!  I was so mad at myself because I finally make it here, but I don't have directions to PROPNAME's or PROPNAME's or their phone numbers. I found PROPNAME's and ORGNAME answered which was exactly what I didn't  want to happen. She bothers me. We used to be friends, but then I don't know what happened, it's like all of a sudden, the only thing that she  cared about was who she was around and how much she could be seen doing thins with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now that she's up here all by herself she sure decided that ORGNAME and PROPNAME and I were perfect people to be her friends AGAIN. I just don't know I mean that I don't like that I feel that way as far as the fact that she just gets on my nerves, but I don't like being mean. I will tell her how I feel, now, because she doesn't seem to have a problem being rude and snotty to me. I went to Audrey's and I wish I had a house like PROPNAME or an apartment like Audrey ORGNAME Ginger. It's nice and filled with a lot more space than my dorm, but then again I kind of like The Woo. LOCNAME and Raya are so  nice. They take care to notice if I'm upset about something and they talk to  me about it. It just doesn't make me feel any better to know that their mothers don't call them EVERY NIGHT AFTER NINE O'CLOCK JUST BECAUSE THEY JUST HAPPENED TO  GET ONE THOUSAND FREE MINUTES ON THEIR PORTABLE PHONE. It's not that I don't like my mother calling, but she calls all the time and tells me to go to bed of all things. Little did she know that I have stayed up until 0:oo every night since Monday, and last night we got home at 0:00 but didn't go to bed  until 0:00. I don't know what she is thinking because she actually could not believe that people stay up until all hours of the night studying. I had to  let her in on a little secret. All of those nights she thought I was asleep, I wasn't. 
__label__label1 Today. Had to turn the music down. Today I went to the KVRX meeting. I  will hopefully have my own radio show. I don’t know what I will talk about. I have considered in great depth and. Jeez this songs starts off quietly. cool beginning. should start louder. oh well can't all be perfect. My roommate is playing the same game . he plays that game too much and spends too much time with it. does he get homework?  I just don't know. This song is rather erotic. in a very deep and disturbing way. I can't decide whether I actually want to study medical technology or not. I love many things form chemistry to mycology to religious studies/. speaking  of which I had a very good time at my PSA meeting. PROPNAME student alliance. ahh. gotta love that screech the chairs let when you push them back. ahhhhh. well. oh yeah at the meeting I met several people. PROPNAME seems rather worried about one of the women. though he is bound and like wise I am unable  to speak ill of her. Well I am in charge of running our booth Monday. or is it Tuesday. That song is one again. his team (my roommate) I s winning. YEESH. Well I guess if he enjoys it. my typing is rather poor and this assignment is taking a long time. 00 minutes. been 0. . lalalalalalalal. Yes the meeting. I talked about shamanism. which apparently comes from a Siberian word. being that there are several hundred different shamanic following in this world. due to the vast number of tribes that speckle our world. PROPNAME PROPNAME has a very sexy voice. I would love to make love to this song,. Well. too much. info. /. Dtos are fun ellipses. that word too is fun. I think that perhaps I am slowly running out of things to say. . That song reminds me of my young age. riding in the car and talking to my  family. the streetlights were bright back then and things were happy. or where they. perhaps not,, I don't remember that well. My car was full of all of us and the  dog wasn't around. She isn't anymore either. epilepsy has taken her from this incarnation. I wonder what she is  doing now. Does she know that I miss her???? I  wish I could find out. Possibly clairvoyance. That is of course under the assumption that spirits are all equal. they are. I know. For I am. Yes I was and shall be. ever. My childhood bears a interesting mark of past fuzziness. I can't seem to recollect exact details like others. very brown. ,. fuzzy is the best word. The 00's really did suck. I wonder why that CD is still lying there on the answering machine. I love bright circling colors. they interest me. not in a psychotic manner but in a very hypnotic manner. they calm. I like to be calm and sedate/. Though activity on occasion is good. . . . PROPNAME is not a good color. neutral  yes but very passive. though passive is good. LOCNAME. there's a philosophy. They believe that by doing nothing they do everything. interesting. I am currently reading PROPNAME PROPNAME His hermetic order seems rather interesting though a bit on the abnormal and almost eccentric side. I remember reading stories about spiders. And milkmen in fields with roses. no daisies. yeah daisies. Looking down upon the daisies as they look up to me. I want to do a past life regression and find out who I was. I wonder if I have been anyone famous or popular. Wow I am saying some rather strange things. interesting. I didn't. . My head hurts. and my room is hot. I would like to stop this. I have 0 minutes left and nothing to say except for watching my fingers press the buttons is a rather enjoyable activity. they press slowly and heavy. sometimes fast and lithe. I mean light. yeah light. so I hope I am doing this right. I am putting my consciousness on record for others to read. I guess that's cool. It should be interesting though I have said very little. I wonder what other are saying. ahh the three minutes have passed and my typing ill now slow to a halt. 
__label__label0 At the moment I’m sitting in my room enjoying a 00 oz. slurpee. A cherry and coke mix, which is my favorite. I have been relaxing after another crummy cafeteria meal thinking about the days occurrences. Tuesdays and Thursdays are rough because I have to go to class all day. Classes aren't really that bad but they seem to put a large strain on  the mind making a body feel worn out. The course load for me this year is tuff and it seems that I have little free time left. This is a very strange assignment in my mind. I can't see what y’all can get from hearing me ramble on about nothing, but if it helps then I guess its worth it. Chapter two in the Psy. book is very interesting in fact I have found the  course to be interesting. To bad it comes after an hour and a half of chemistry and the most boring class I have ever been in. The selection of girls in the class isn't bad either. So an interesting class combined with good looking scenery is a big plus in my book. Whoa brain freeze. damn I hate those. Well after this I have to start on my M 000D homework. Now that is one hard class. That one and Chem 000 are going to be the death of me this semester. It seems like a 00 minute free flow writing assignment seems like it  would be hard, but once you start it just seems to flow, kind of like a good rap song. I really like rap the combination of a good beat and  a master on the microphone to me is really fine music. However, I love oldies too The Beatles, Mommas & the Pappas, The Monkeys, and so on  are really good listening music. Kind of like returning to my roots I guess. Well that was twenty minutes so I’ll shut up now hope this was enough to fulfill your requests.  
__label__label0 Well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, I finally found one. Unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. I can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!)  I am smiling now. I always find irony amusing. They are still pounding next door. What the hell are they doing. HE HEHEEHEH-they just called us the 'Fort Worth Girls'  now that's funny stuff. I seriously have a major stomach ache. It hurts soo soo soo bad. I have been sick for like, three or four days now, I really feel terrible. My insides just hurt and every time I stand up I get dizzy. This computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. Oh well I only have 00 minutes left if I did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, I probably did not do. I kind of feel bad that these people I don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. That's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it?  Everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. I wish my computer was working. It's really, really cute. It's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. I wonder how I did on my French test two days ago. I hope that I did okay. I am seeing all kinds of new people. Isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you don’t know and will never meet?  I think that that is , well to say the least, strange. MY back really hurts. I think , wow, coughing fit, that I will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. I feel so bad now, physically and mentally. I cant wait to go home this weekend. Have my mom take care of me and see my guy that I am kind of dating. I miss him. he says he misses me. I wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. I said that I loved him but I don’t know if I really meant it. I don’t know if I could ever really love anyone. After all, I really don’t even think that I love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. Anyway, he has a boxer dog named PROPNAME. Very cute. I hate most dogs however. I love my cats. I miss my cats. I am glad I am getting at least this first assignment done. I cant spell for shit tonight. I also manage to talk like a sailor. Oh well. I feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until I leave, I guess I wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. I wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when I leave. That must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, I guess I'll just be as nice as I can be. I really don’t want her to hate me but oh well. Oh hello boy in very very short shorts. That is so LOCNAME. I am just in extreme pain. I want to work out and I haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. Hello freshman 00, 00, 00. I’m all about gaining weight this year. My mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. Maybe I just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. I want to go to LOCNAME. I wonder what exactly constitutes 00 minutes. I really must be very very thankful. I am such a terrible person. I really really am mean. 
__label__label0 Okay, I just started writing or well I guess typing. I am still kind of emotionless because I just woke up. You know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. I'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. I am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. I have a pretty good feeling because I got to this page alot easier than I thought I would. Right now the only thing I really think about is a situation I am in. I am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and I don't really know. The big problem is that this guy I dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the ORGNAME) to PROPNAME which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if I am seeing anyone new. I don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that I am waiting for him. Knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone I happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. This is something I normally would not mind doing, but I really like this guy I am dating so I don't know what to do. My bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. I probably need to have that checked out. I am having to shift positions right now because I am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. Now my nose itches so I have to rub it. My room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until I have the chance to take them home. My hands are starting to shake a little so I must be getting hungry. My roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. I kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. You can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. I really miss my cat, PROPNAME PROPNAME, I have had her since I was two and she is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I think my twenty minutes are about up and I am really hungry, so I'm going to end this. BYE!!   
__label__label0   Okay, I am working on assignment number one in which if I understand correctly, I am to follow my thought pattern. I am thinking about everything that I need to accomplish in the next two or three days. This is difficult to follow because everything seems to run together. This happens to me every night when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes it takes me hours to get there. I have to actually talk myself into clearing my thoughts in order for me to get some sleep. There have got to be some better relaxation techniques that I should try in order to sleep, because I am always tired. When you are always tired, it is difficult to get everything accomplished because your mind and body just do not cooperate. I wonder how much power the mind actually has over the body. Maybe that is something that we will discuss in class. I find the topic very interesting. It is amazing how much more conscientious you become of your thoughts when you are trying to track them. It seems to make you lose some of the negativity or criticism that usually passes through one's mind. It is hard to think when you are trying to, but when you would rather not, you are overloaded with thoughts. Just what exactly are thoughts anyway?  I wonder just how the brain actually thinks. The human mind and body are absolutely amazing. They work so precisely that it is quite intriguing. Life itself is amazingly difficult sometimes. All my life, I have wanted to get big, now I would love to be back in kindergarten. Life was so simple back then,  Now everything is rushed and hurried and there are still not enough hours in the day to get everything done that needs to be done. I wonder how other people seem to do everything with such ease, because I definitely cannot seem to get away with doing anything easily. Maybe I will be a stronger person because of it, or maybe I will be insane by age 00. Who knows? only time will tell. I wish I could see into the future to know whether what I am doing now will pay off or if it is being done in vain. Time, what a concept anyway. I would imagine that the world would be quite chaotic without it, but sometimes I still wish that it would go away. I have been typing for a little more than ten minutes now. look at that, I just used time in a simple statement. The concept of time has probably always existed in some form or fashion, however it could not have always been this exact. I wonder who came up with making it the way it is today and if that person knew what a profound effect it would have on the world. I am already ready for Christmas break. I had an absolutely wonderful summer and cannot quite seem to put summer behind me and get in the going to school mode. I want to do well in my classes. I graduated fourth in my class and had a GPA of over one hundred. I made one B is first grade and swore that I would never make another. I guess college is a different thing though and I will have to wait and see how everything works out. It is quite an adjustment from high school. I was trying to stay away from this topic due to our second writing assignment, but my mind is consumed with thoughts about everything that is going on right now which is moving away and going to this absolutely huge school. There are more people on this campus than there are in my whole town. Anyway, I have been typing for more than twenty minutes now. I think my mind skips around a lot and jumps from topic to topic, but oh well, that is how I work. 
__label__label0 I am sitting at my kitchen table right now and I am really frustrated. I am trying to write an English paper and it is so bad. I think I am so stupid sometimes. It really frustrates me when I can't do something perfect. I am also feeling kind of lonely today. I wish I was living at ORGNAME ORGNAME because that is where all my friends live. They all seem to be making so many new friends and I just don't feel that way. I am loving college in some ways and in other ways I hate it. I really want a boyfriend. Alot of my friends have been asked to all these pledge lines and I just haven't. Am I ugly?  Am I fat?  Sometimes I just want to know what exactly in wrong with me. I am tired of drinking. Everybody in LOCNAME is an alcoholic. It makes me feel terrible and lazy. It is fun for a while and then the next day you feel like crap. My roommates still aren't back yet from LOCNAME LOCNAME. What's wrong?  My other roommate is getting in the shower. I wonder why. I wonder why PROPNAME PROPNAME hasn't called me. He was my date a few nights ago. He was such a gentleman. I don't think we could ever date though. I am not a very good dancer. I get real nervous when I am on the dance floor. My friends from LOCNAME left today. I didn't go out with them last night. I read my friends paper and she was talking about how drunk she was at the time. It kind of shocked me. It was kind of funny though. I think it gives me more self-esteem when guys like me. Is that horrible?  Diet coke is so gross. Why am I drinking one right now?  Should I call my brother?  His girlfriend is so awesome. She is one of my favorite people in the entire world. I love my brother too but he gets drunk too much. I hope he doesn’t become an alcoholic. I wish people would come see me. I get kind of lonely sometimes or maybe it is that I don't want to be doing my work right now. I kind of like homework though because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. That is also why I like to run. Because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. I am really nervous about my English paper. I don't think it is very good. I am going to rewrite it now since I gave been rambling for twenty minutes. I need to pray. I wonder if God is always listening. Oh well, I'll stop now. 
__label__label1 Homework, I hate homework. no it's not that. It's more like I hate the  obligation to be busy that it entails. Why is it that after finishing homework or exercises that you feel so great, but actually starting it is so stressful. Why is it that something that is so helpful is hard to motivate?  One would  think that lazy people would have been weeded out by natural selection by now  and it'd be easier for those left behind to get motivated. But from what I've  seen in the history texts, people aren't only not more motivated, they're less!! So if this goes on, it'll get harder and harder for people to get things done. And I'm already having enough problems as it is!   It makes me wonder if the human  race will survive to see a true 'space age'?  I mean, We've made so much  progress in that area already, but at the rate that apathy and disinterest that  sweeping through the population, it's quite possible that we'll never get off of our own little mudball in order to see what the other little mudballs circling a bunch of burning hydrogen look like. Not only that, but what about all these  alien theory's?  There is a truism (called that 'cause they're normally true)  that says, "There is a seed of truth even in the most outrageous rumor"  So I  want to know what that seed of truth is!!  What, or who, is out there. If it's nothing, I want to find out. So maybe in my lifetime there will not be any  answers, but from heaven or hell or wherever I go, if indeed I go anywhere other than the ground, I want someone to somewhere figure out the answer!  Or that  there is not an answer. Oh, well. I think my twenty minutes are up. So  hopefully what little motivation I've mustered will result in more than just a  good grade (although that's good too!) 
__label__label1 Today is only the sixth official day of class, and I am already stressed out. I know that I don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but I feel  just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. I wish I was already set  into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. I get  nervous every time I think of what possibly lies ahead. I also have to start  looking for a job. I feel I do not have the time to work, but I believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if I have set things to do. I  guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. I mean 0-00 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job I could find. I can look in to this of Friday considering I only  have one class, although I seriously think I should take an extra hour or two  to simply lay down and rest. I haven't done that in a while. What else do I  have to do on Friday?  Look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and  whatever else comes up. Let's see, Saturday. The game is on Saturday, so I  guess I will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. At least  I will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. So far, I guess I like it here. I mean I am having fun and enjoying myself but I just got use to  doing nothing during the summer. No reading, no calculus, no tennis, no PROPNAME. -Co. or ORGNAME meetings. Not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. Yet, I do miss tennis. Even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it  was always a blast. I miss the team especially, and all my close friends. I am  the only one of my closest friends that came to LOCNAME, but I guess it is all working out fine. If I went with them to college, I would be at ORGNAME. Naah, I'm OK here. I can always call them. I miss home. I knew that I would be homesick. Even  though I like being here, I sometimes wish I was still at home, in my house, with  mom, dad, and even PROPNAME & PROPNAME. Gosh, I never thought I would miss those two brats this much. OH, I miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. I need to call  her tomorrow. It's already to late. I wonder what they are all doing right now. They are all probably asleep. I'm hungry, actually just thirsty. I could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. I can't wait for this  weekend. Hopefully I will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 00:00 am. Going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. My legs are so sore from all the walking I have to do every day. I'm used to jogging and walking at least 0 miles most days, but walking here is  exhausting. Uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. Just thinking about it makes me tired. I need to get everything I need ready for tomorrow, but I think I am just going to lie down and watch TV till I fall asleep. I am so tired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
__label__label0 NOTE:  Something happened when I was typing this-the words never skipped down to the next line. (Maybe it's supposed to be that way?!)  Anyway, my thoughts continue to the right-quite a ways. Sorry for the hassle!!   I'm not really sure what this whole assignment is about, but it should be fairly easy for me since I think way too much at times. My thoughts??  I am extremely tired right now. I had a very exhausting weekend and would love to not have classes in the morning. I am doing everything  possible to procrastinate and not begin my huge amount of work. I still haven't really gotten in to the whole college thing. I feel like I am in some kind of dream world-like I it's not really me sitting in a college class with 000 other students. Maybe I was spoiled in high school with classes of only a max of 00 and a graduating class of only 000. Our teachers probably babied us with lots of one-on-one attention-which at the time I loved and appreciated. But NOW I am so overwhelmed!  I'm now only a number out of hundreds of other kids. I guess this whole experience is a big transition no matter what. Anyway, I hope I am doing this correctly. I have no idea why my computer is laying out my words like this. I hate computers!!  We just don’t mix well. I am completely computer illiterate. Sorry if this is taking you longer to read. I am very excited about this psychology class. It happens to be one of my possible majors. Who knows what will happen?!  All I know is that I am a people person and a very good listener that would love to be able to help people in anyway I can. I know it is a tough major with tons of schooling, but it really interests me. I just finished talking to a few of my friends from high school on the phone. They all seem so far away. I miss them and all the fun times we shared. I love reminiscing about our memories, especially looking at old pictures. My walls are full of pictures of friends and family and I'm sure by the end of the year you won't be able to  tell what color the walls are. I miss my family too. 
__label__label1 wow, I want to go talk to the socialist organization they have a booth out on the west mall, but I am scared. I called them a long time ago. do they remember? I was supposed to go to that march but I didn't I hope they don't remember me-as  not showing up-I’ll go in a little while. I hope the toadies don't open up for rage on Saturday, the toadies don't deserve to open up for a band like rage-rage has energy and pizzazz. the toadies suck, they're okay. i dunno, that boy looks like PROPNAME, I don't know what to write, I am trying to write whatever pops into my head first, I wonder what they're gonna do with this I thought he was sam, I  look around at people  a lot, I wonder what people think o f me when they see me,  I think I am pretty thin, but I have a poofy stomach. liposuction would be great, what am I gonna say when I go up to the socialists? hello? I am ericka, I called one of you before--was it you? no no no --I just have to be calm, why am I so nervous? my stomach is tying up in knots. breath in , gosh that's so lame that the wu tang clan cancelled, they suck, why did they do that, I wanted to see the, live- then I could say I’ve seen them, I’ve seen rage, ORGNAME prison  experiment, mighty mighty bosstones, pietasters, h0o, cherry poppin daddies, miss xana don't and the whatevers, less than jake, discount, frenzal rhomb, the impossibles. I have probably seen others, but I dunno, I like shows, PROPNAME goes to all the ones I go to but I haven't even met her in person yet, only on the  computer, how weird the computer brings people together, maybe I’ll write her tomorrow, or today, I don't have much time lately, I am sleepy, I want to hang out with people, especially boys, they are my friends more than girls although I am  one, we get naked in front of each other, we spit, burp, fart, we are comfortable or at least I am,  I wonder if they look at me like one of them, well I guess so, if we do those sorts of things. I am pretty much a boy, sometimes I wish I was, but I like being a girl, no not when it's time to bleed, but see, I can have a baby, and do other things they can't, I love boys, I love PROPNAME, gosh I wish he was here so I could take him down to the socialist table with me I think he knows them, I hope they don't leave, I am going to go when I finish this typing thingy, I can type pretty fast, she looked like PROPNAME, why hasn't she called me, is she in LOCNAME? I hope PROPNAME didn't leave he probably did, I had a dream he left, I bet he left, he didn't say bye, I hope he emails me, I hope  he doesn't forget me, I hope he has fun in merry old LOCNAME the princess' funeral is on Saturday, I am glad it's on TV. how sad that was, those freak photographers killed her. paparazzi assassins, he is nevermind. cramps hurt my body bad, but only recently, I wonder why---I never got them before. I am just unlucky what an unlucky girl am I --three more minutes of this, my fingers are getting tired next I will get on the list serve for my juvenile delinquency class, then I will talk to the socialists I hope my breath isn't bad I have chicken breath, but I was in a hurry after lunch. no time no time for picking my butt just do it I hope they're still there when I go down, if they aren't I dunno, I hope PROPNAME likes me, I kinda like him. I hope I have been writing long enough I think so  adios 
__label__label1 You know, when typing on a computer, twenty minutes is a long time. Figuring a person types 00 to 00 words per minutes, they will be typing between 0000 words and 0000 words per minute. I wonder if this assignment would be more effective if the students had to write it in pen, so that you could also see how they changed their mind. I know that I have already erased and retyped. I don't mean that I have taken the stream of consciousness out of it, just that I will change my mind on how I want to phrase things. I want this to make sense to any poor, unfortunate person who has to read this thing, and sometimes I takes me a while figure out a way to phrase thing that will accurately get the message of what I am trying to express across. Okay, I have managed to confuse myself with this stuff that I am saying. Somehow I don't consider it to be a good sign when I can confuse myself with something that I am thinking. It's too bad that I type faster than I think b/c right now I can even get all of my thoughts down. Wow, it finally put me on another line!  I don't have any idea what time I actually started typing. I remember looking at the clock at 0:00, but I was already typing then. I guess that I will just count that as my starting time, I am guessing that it really doesn't matter how long I write. Back to the confusing myself thing. you know, I have a habit of confusing myself. I will ask myself questions or think about ideas which really are lacking in logic, or else they have a strange logic. For example, at my high school, I am famous for my opinions about being normal. I once told my friend that I was the only normal person, and that the rest of them were all abnormal. Having said this, I realize that if I am the only normal person, that would make it abnormal to be normal, and normal to be abnormal. This would mean that although I was the only normal person in the group, I was really abnormal b/c it is normal to be abnormal and abnormal to be normal. At first this appears to make no sense, but once you think about it for a while, it starts to make perfect sense, at least to me anyway. And those people who have been blessed enough to hear this theory get it eventually. I have no idea if I am supposed to be writing this thing as if I was talking to someone, but that is really the only way that I can write it. I am used to writing emails a lot like this, and I have a tendency to talk like this too. I will say, or write whatever is on my mind. This  results in a lack of sentences in my emails. I separate the thoughts with little dots. everything is in sentence fragments. I just write what I am thinking at the time. That is why I was so happy about this assignment, imagine, I am getting a grade for doing something that I do all the time!  But then again, it's not like the people I write to hate my emails. In fact, most of them love my emails. My boyfriend, PROPNAME, always tells me how much he loves my emails. And lately, I have noticed that I have been influencing people with the way I write. More and more of my friends have started writing very stream of consciousness emails to me. I like them though, b/c I think that they give a greater insight into how a person if feeling and what they are thinking. I am a terrible speller, and a bad typer too. I can type really fast, but I am not high on the accuracy. Sometimes I do really great, but other times, well. it's embarrassing. I think that in college I am gonna major in typos and creative spelling!  I haven't eaten anything today. It is 0:00 now. I guess after I finish this I will go back to the dorm room and then I will go eat dinner. Or maybe I won't. I am not really that hungry but I feel bad about wasting meal tickets. Last week I didn't eat anywhere near the two meals a day that we bought. I might just go and eat some yogurt that I have in the fridge. The advantage to not eating, and then getting all this extra exercise walking around this school, is that it will help me get in shape. This is ridiculous, it has been 00 minutes and I am only on the [now] fifth line!  You know, I don't like typing. I think that I am a candidate for carpal tunnel. I am exaggerating a bit, but my hands get tired quickly from typing. I think that I strain them b/c the table is too high and therefore I am resting my hands on the keyboard too much. I just moved the keyboard to my lap and that actually helps. I am a semi computer nerd. I know about software, and how to use the web. However, I am not a hacker, and my knowledge of hardware is not the best. maybe average. I can build my own computer, or do anything illegal. but put a program in front of me, and I will either know how to use it, or else I will figure out how to use it fairly quickly. I am glad that this about finished. It is actually tiring trying to keep up with what I am thinking. I just finished psych class and so I decided to stop at the pcl library and do this before I forget. I meant to do these assignments this weekend, but I forgot. actually, I just didn't get time. My best friends online boyfriend came to LOCNAME this weekend, and I am friends with him too, so I wanted to meet him also. He flew in from PROPNAME CA. quite far. We had never met him before now. He is really nice too, only. he is a bit inappropriate acting, in that he was feeling me, and he even French kissed me. he felt on Amber (my friend) too, and kissed her more. but the point is, his hands should only be up one person's shirt. and that is Amber, not me!  I hope that this won't really get published b/c this stuff about PROPNAME is not something that I want everyone to find out about. He was still really nice, and I liked him. just not romantically. I guess maybe he is just like that. I did tell Amber about what happened. I needed to, if she didn't mind(which, for some reason, she didn't), then it's all good. well, 'cept that I don't want him to kiss me, or feel up my shirt or in my overalls. That is why I won't let him do it again. however, I don't know when or if I will see him again, so it may never come up. Anyway, time is up, so I am gonna submit this thing, and hike it back to the dorm. actually the dorm isn't too far!  I might sit outside and read the paper before going back though. It will depend on how I feel. Okay, here it is. hope it was helpful, or served the purpose it was supposed to. 
__label__label0 Right now I'm sitting here at my brothers house. I'm very tired and wish I was in my bed. We had a ORGNAME meeting tonight and I'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. It just seems like their is something everyday. I wish I could just do some stuff and not all of it. I hate other people having control over me and telling how I have to spend my afternoon. I just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. Maybe I shouldn’t have joined a sorority. Oh well!  I just need a break everything is happening so fast and I'm having second thoughts about the whole Tri-Delt thing because I really don't know anybody yet. Maybe once I start to meet people I feel more comfortable. I'm very excited because my dad is coming to LOCNAME thurs-sunday. He is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. I haven't talked to my dad in awhile so I can't wait to see him. I guess I'm a little homesick or at least more than I let show. I just worry that I/m the only one feeling this way and I don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. But I don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. She is not interested in the same stuff I am and just sits around and plays on the computer. Well enough about that. I'm really hungry but I don’t want to eat anything because I worry about gaining the freshman 00. All my roommate eats is fat fat FAT. So their is all kinds of junk food in my room and I get tempted to eat it. She isn't worried about her weight. I very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. She is real nice and I was surprised that she asked me to live with her. I said yes but I will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. Last night was the weirdest thing I set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. This was the first time that I had the chance since I've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. I even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that I was with them. It was just two months ago. I wish I was back their right now because I had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. Well it has been 00 min. so I guess I'll let you go. Got to go study!!!!! 
__label__label1 Ok, my thoughts for 00 min. It's 0:00 right now so I'll be done at 0:00. I feel like a moron doing this. I don't even know how to use internet. I wish PROPNAME hurry up and come set up my Ethernet. I really need to write PROPNAME a letter. I bet she's mad at me since I wrote PROPNAME and not her. Where and when and how am I going to type this up. It's only been 0 min!  00 more minutes of free thoughts. PROPNAME sure has been on the phone for a long time. she's always on the phone with 'T', PROPNAME. They always get in fights too. I wonder if it's ok for me to ask her about that guy she met in LOCNAME that asked her out. Probably not since she turned red and silent when PROPNAME pointed out her hickey. I guess I won't say anything. My hand kind of hurts now. I think alot faster than I write. I wonder if that was someone at he door just a second ago. You know, maybe I'll write up both of these assignments tonight and then type them up on different days. Nah, I don't feel like doing the college one tonight. I am such a bad typist. This would have been so much shorter if I just typed it rather than transpose my thoughts. I don't think I'll worry about spelling correctly when I do type this. PROPNAME is still on the phone and PROPNAME has not come to fix my computer yet. I guess I have less power over him since he made out with some chick  on Saturday. Sexual tension can be such a powerful tool. Hmmm, what time is it? 0:00, only 0 more minutes to go. My head itches, now my nose. Ah, that's much better. I wonder if PROPNAME really does like PROPNAME. It seems like it sometimes. Channing hates PROPNAME because of it. can't believe I spilled out some of my innermost secrets to PROPNAME and he's so rude to me sometimes. I sure do miss PROPNAME. I wonder if he'll write me. As soon as LOCNAME gets my letter she'll probably send me his address. I'm not going to write to him though unless he writes me first. I really like my handwriting. It looks very similar to my mother's. What time is it now? 0:00. I'm done. I can't believe I thought such stupid things in these past 00 minutes. 
__label__label0   It is Tuesday night, about 0 o'clock, and I don't really have time to do this assignment but I know that I have to so I'm going to do it anyway. I'm about ready to throw this computer off the desk right now because I am so mad. I have the most annoying boyfriend in the world whom I want to kill. Not really kill, maybe just hurt really bad. He thinks he knows everything in the world and he doesn't, nor will he admit that he acts this way. Everyone around him can see this accept him. It really bothers me. When I try to tell him he just says "whatever, I don't think I know everything" but he really does act this way. It bothers me so much sometimes that I get so upset and frustrated that I want to cry. But O well. There is nothing I can do about it and he is to stubborn to even listen to me so I guess I can either find a way to deal with it or not. And if I can't or if he doesn't change I guess this relationship will fail after almost 0 years. What a waste. O well, I tried. I guess we will have to wait and see. So anyway that is what is on my mind right now and I can't believe that I have been writing for almost 00 minutes. It seems like 0 or 00. That is pretty nifty. I like this assignment alot. It made me feel alot better, so gracias. I'm kinda worried that something might happen to this and whoever is going to grade this won't ever get it. I have really bad luck like that. I guess I'll find out at class next time. Hopefully my social security number will be on the big list. If not, I guess I'm screwed. I wonder if anybody is going to read this ? I hope not. I will sound pretty dumb. Maybe everyone else will to. Guess what the buzzer for 00 minutes is going crazy so even though it has been great, I must depart. So long till tomorrow. 
__label__label0 I am constantly thinking about the past. I often think about the good things that have occurred in my highschool years. I feel really sad because I miss my family so bad. I am always thinking about how I never get in trouble anymore because my parents aren't here to get mad at me whenever I come home late. I feel so lonely here. nobody knows anybody. Everywhere I turn I see different faces that I probably wont ever see again this semester. I feel so depressed because my boyfriend is gone. I am always dreaming about being together again, but its not going to happen ever because we just broke up. I miss him so bad and I can't ever be with him anymore just because I have too much darn pride. I wish I didn't have so much pride. PRIDE gets me nowhere all it does is leave you wondering What could have been? or where would I be standing now with him had I not been so proud. I am so sad, but then again I would rather have alot of pride than no pride at all. I wonder what I’m going to do with my life. Everybody seems to know exactly what they are good at. I don't!! I'm totally lost I don't know what I’m the best at. How are you supposed to know what career is the best one to choose. I want to do good in school but people don't work to the best of their ability unless they have certain goals. I'm not determined. I don't know if I will be successful dancing ballet or operating on some dying person. I'm too confused. I'm happy I have my brother I love him so much I don't know what I would do without him. I’m really hungry . I didn't have breakfast, lunch or dinner because I was too mad about my boyfriend or ex-boyfriend I should say. I can't think or sleep or eat I don't know what to do should I let go of all of this pride that I have? NO, it will be better for me in the longrun. Why do people get hurt so much. I don't understand my mind knows that things happen for a reason. I know deep down inside that for some reason this happened and that things will get better, but I’m hurting so bad inside and I still want to smile at people and say hi to my friends even when I don't want to talk to anybody. I don't understand why I have to feel horrible and my friends are all having a blast. Why do some people live the best life and others don't get it so easily. It's not fair to have some people be happy all the time and others who are born without an arm or who's parent's have died or who have some sickness why them and not me for example? 
__label__label1 I just got done watching "First Time Felon" staring PROPNAME PROPNAME. I was very moving. I'm cooking stew right now on the stove. I learned how to cook it from my father. He taught me how this summer. Earlier today, I did this writing assignment and after completing it, I pressed clear instead of submit. That sure got me upset. Anyway, I went to class today and the lecture was funny. The phone is ringing right now. The phone is still ringing. There, someone finally picked up the phone. I have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. And in two weeks I'll start having my first set of tests. They all fall on me at once. When I think about it, I don't want to study. But thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. I kind of enjoy it. It was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. I remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. That was a really nice view. I wonder how the stew is doing. Hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. I see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. I really miss him. He was like a brother to me. We always looked out for each other. I'm really good friends with his brother too. He is a good church-going person. Faithfully believes in God. Well, I haven't talked to either of them for some time now. Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow if I have time. My girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. It was just a message. I really miss her. She is back in LOCNAME. Her birthday is coming up on the 00th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. The problem is that I have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. I wish I could take the tests some other time. Oh, well. That's life for you. My brother landed an internship with ORGNAME, but hasn't started work yet. I wonder when he will start. His future looks bright for him. I can hear the T. V. downstairs. Some cartoon show is playing right now. My roommates are downstairs watching it. I can see my keys from where I'm sitting. They are attached to the Pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. Actually I have two key chains. The other one is of PROPNAME. A total stranger gave it to me one day and I've never seen him since. I like to think that it was PROPNAME himself, giving me strength when I needed it the most last year. I was feeling down and out last year. I was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. He walks up to me and gives me the key chain. He tells me that Jesus will never turn his back on me. So every time I look at the key chain, I think of Him and it gives me strength. School is finally underway now. I hope that I do good this year. Anyway, the 00 mins are up. Hopefully I'm doing this right. I know that this isn't even for a grade, but I just worry a lot. Speaking about worrying, I'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because I've been calling back to LOCNAME everyday. 
__label__label1 It was the second one for this job at the astronomy lab. I would be really excited if I got this job. Mostly because the people seem really laid back and fun. Also because I want to know about the stars. That would be neat to be able to impress people with my boundless knowledge about the boundless sky. I think I have a pretty good chance at getting the job. I was the very first person to call after she put the advertisement in. She told me to come in for an informal interview, mostly to show me around the place and introduce me to people. By the time I got there, 0 other people had called. Today she said she had spoke to about 00 people and narrowed it down among me and two other people. I think the interview went pretty well. I concentrated on sending out a hire me vibe. I wonder if being the first caller will increase my chances. What a cool job. So PROPNAME has asked me to go see Giant with him tonight. I think I'll go. I hope he doesn't fall for me. That sounds conceited, but almost all of the guys that I want to be just friends with have a nasty habit of falling madly in love with me. it's really annoying. Maybe I should concentrate on being just friends with all the boys and that way the ones that I want to fall madly in love with me will. this sounds like the null hypothesis that we learned about in biology the other day. It's something like making a hypothesis based on past data. it's based on the theory that all populations are alike and any abnormalities are due to chance alone. So if all the boys that I'm just friends with fall for me, all the boys that I continue to be just friends with will fall for me. At least in some way. I think I'm a likeable person. I think people feel relaxed around me. People are always telling me things and then saying I can't believe I just told you that. things just tend to slip out. So I may go see Giant tonight. I think PROPNAME PROPNAME is in that. My sister used to be a huge PROPNAME PROPNAME fan. That's a main reason why I'm going. I love my sister. She is so smart and I was thinking last Monday night that she has influenced me in many wonderful ways. I was at my friends house last night and PROPNAME started playing blackbird on the guitar. My sister and I shared a room for a while and she would always play that song as I was falling asleep. Not because she wanted to play me a lullaby or anything, just because she was trying to teach herself guitar, which she did very well by the way. The other song she used to always play was, um , I forget the name but this guy was playing it on the street today. Today it made me smile while the other night, Black Bird almost made me cry. I was in a sad emotional mood. I think I get moody right before and right after my period. The other night was right after. What was that  song. it's by pink PROPNAME. Oh well. I really want to get my CD player back. it's up in LOCNAME at my x boyfriends place because I wasn't' going to need it this summer so I let him borrow it. I'll see him in a couple of weeks. I have mixed feelings about seeing him. I'm excited but scarred that I'm really not going to like him anymore. I think he's going to move to LOCNAME over Christmas. I hope that works out. I also hope we can find some happy medium to our relationship. He was one of the reasons that I was so down the other night. I think I was lonely for a male companion or something. And I sort of have this crush on that guy PROPNAME. His roommates are PROPNAME and PROPNAME. PROPNAME and PROPNAME used to date, but PROPNAME, PROPNAME's best friend who I'm going to the movie's with tonight says that PROPNAME broke up with PROPNAME and that's why john is glad that PROPNAME has found another really nice guy to date. But I think that makes PROPNAME sort of regret breaking up with her because you can tell by watching them how much they still care for each other. It's kind of frustrating since I kind of like PROPNAME now. This sounds like some sort of soap opera. I've never been into watching those, although my sister used to watch Days of our Lives religiously. I'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this since there's no wrong or right answer. The assignment was to write for at least 00 minutes and that's it. So is somebody going to read this or are you just going to check off names to see that it was done. I think another reason I want to get this job, other than making money, well I guess it is making money because there are a lot of things I want to buy. Every time I go to the book store I see this little disc man that I really want. I don't have a CD player here, remember?  and I could use it in my car this summer. I really want a CD player for my car. Well, if I get hired today, I will go out and reward myself by buying that disc man. I went to my friend PROPNAME's ranch this weekend. I came up with this awesome idea. I want to get a climbing harness and rig up some ropes so I can throw the rope over a tree limb, hook it back to me, and hitch myself up and sit among the tree branches. I think this is an awesome idea, so it probably already exists in some form or fashion. Basically I'll need all the things they use to rappel down cliffs. I'm going to go the gym to check out the equipment and how it works to decide what kind of design I'll need. My 00 minutes are up. I think I went over, but I don't know by how much. Wouldn't it suck if I accidentally hit the clear button instead of the submit button. I will have to be very careful. I just remembered that the other song my sister used to play was Wish you were here by pink PROPNAME. 
__label__label0 I am really confused right now because this girl that I think is so incredibly attractive and fun and nice and well you get the picture. Anywho. She says that she likes me it's just that she does not want a serious relationship. I totally understand that because the more that I think about it I don't want that either. I am not really sure what it is that I want. I know that I just want someone to be there for me. It would be nice to have someone who you always know will be there. Maybe I should just explain to her that I am not asking her for marriage. I am just asking for her to be there for me when I need her and I will always be there for her when she needs me. In high school I really was kind of a guy who moved around A LOT!!!!  I could never be satisfied with one person for an extend period of time. I mean hell I just got bored. But with her it is different. The first day we met we stayed up until 0am the next day just talking on my friends couch in his dorm room. Then we fell asleep together on the couch and when we got back up we just started talking again. I have only know her for a week but I feel like I have know her forever. I mean I found out so much about her in such a little time. I sometimes don't know that much about people whom I have know forever. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. Women are so darn confusing. Well maybe it is the situation that is actually confusing not her. Or maybe it could be me?!?!?!  Well guys aren't confusing. I mean we say what we mean and girls just read way to much into it. I guess I just want her to feel the same way about me that I feel about her. However, there is a lot going on this fall. I have just started college (and I think that may be the reason that she doesn't want a boyfriend) and I am thinking about joining either the Business Council, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, or the Iron Spikes (they are the baseball teams spirit organization). With all of this maybe I won't have time for her. And I would not want to be so into her then have her start liking me and I stop liking her. I would feel so bad if that happened. I just want a good girl who will treat me like I deserve to be treated and like me for who I am. I guess I should just give it some time. Things happen for reasons and who am I to think I can change someone. Well I guess if I really wanted to I could manipulate her into doing what I want. (I am too good at doing that. It kind of scares me)  But what the hell would that accomplish?  Nothing. Well nothing good can come of it atleast. Someone once said that we are who we are today because of the choices we made yesterday. So I am going to make a choice to just let things run their course. If it is meant to happen then it will. If not no big deal. ***side thought****** I am not the fastest typer and my fingers are starting to get stiff. ***side thought is over*****  I am not really sure what this writing assignment is going to accomplish, but I hope it helped you as much as it helped me. It actally gave me a chance to sit down for 00 minutes and actually reflect on something that has been bothering me for a few days. Wow this psychology stuff is pretty cool. I may just have to minor in this. I am starting to like it. :) :) :) :) :) :) :) 
__label__label1 I am very disappointed. its been raining all day and I'm tired. I didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. I can't stand not sleeping. Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not good enough for college, or at least ORGNAME. Things have been hectic the whole time I have been on campus, and if I don't do good this semester, I'm going to fail out. I hope that I can pull this all off. The weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. I need to do stuff like that more often. I hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since I liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. I miss high school, sadly enough. I liked school a lot better when it was just me and 0000 other people. I knew everyone, everyone knew me. Life was good. I can't stand this 00k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. I'm lucky to see A friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. Oh well, I hope that life gets better soon. This weekend should be a lot of fun. Oh, my pizza is ready, its been 00 minutes since I sat down. I spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. Same old problem for me. I can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, I suck. 
__label__label0 I got very bored doing my chemistry homework so I decided to do my psy. I am very excited about tomorrow night because my sorority is having a mixer. I am a little confused about what is going on with my ex-boyfriend. I guess since that is what I am thinking about I might as well write about it. I don't understand why boys expect so much from girls when they are starting college. Sometimes it really gets on my nerves how they expect you to come see them in another town every chance you have. They must not understand that we have other things to do. They are not always more important, but they are things that we are obligated to. For example, all I have heard about for the past year before I even came to school here was how bad sororities are. That is the biggest bunch of bull I have ever heard. I am now in a sorority, broken up with my boyfriend and having the best time hanging out with my friends. Now he is telling me that it is great that I am in a sorority, but I just think it is a bunch of crap. He is just telling me what I want to hear. I have done it   plenty of time. Anyways, why worry about that. Well on to a new subject. I love how brain wanders in very different directions all the time. Like tonight, I planned on staying in my room and making the most out of my time. Well since I love my friends so much, when one of them called me and asked me to take him to his truck, I got up and did it. I wasted an hour and a half just out talking to people I did not know. Oh well, I made a couple of new friends. I also hate it when the   phone rings non stop and every call is for me and I have to stop reading to talk to these people who call asking me how I like college. What do they think I'm going to say, that I hate it and want to go back to litttle bitty LOCNAME LOCNAME. Yea right!  I was excited though when my aunt called and told me to come over any time I want to. And when I got to talk to my best friend in the world it was a lot of fun. Anyways, I don't even have the slightest idea what I am writing about because I can't remember what I have said. I guess I am getting CRS like my mom. I guess it happens when you have more things to organize and think about. I am really glad that my parents made me take typing in high school because I would have a  problem typing all of this if I could not type. I am really pumped up about the football game this weekend. I am so glad that a group of us are going. Well my time is almost over and then I can go up to my room and mark off one assignment from my list that I made. I am really glad that I am an organized person and take on responsibility well. So far organizing time for all of my homework and all of my social activities has gone rather well. I have not had to miss anything and I have kept up with my reading. Well since this is not a grade, I guess since I rambled on it is o. k. My mind is not thinking very complex right now. Just very simple no brained thoughts after a very long day of classes!  
__label__label0 it is 0:00 right now and I have to write for 00 minutes. my roommate is going to come in here and read this and make fun of me. she said she would be home at 0;00 I bet it will be a lot later. damn, I'm really bad at typing, iwish I did't have to look at the keyboard while I did this. I wonder who will be reading this thing. I would really like to read someone elses. I hope after this I can get back on that pretesting thing because it sure as hell wasn't working for me earlier. what if I can never get back on it. I'll probably fail this class. man, I just got a call from someone at atm. I could see it on the caller id. shit, that means I'm going to have to calle them back and pay for the long distance. I couldn't answer it and let it skrew up my thinking process. ireally wonder who is going to read this. I wonder how much more time I have. I don't want to look at the clock that will make it seem worse. I wonder what my parents are doing. I bet they're pretty bored. I really suck at typing maybe I should take keyboarding class or something, am I going to run out of room here? it looks like it, oh no ican keep going. I feel like doing something fun. I wish bryce would stop calling so damn much. watch him get on line and be able to read this. iwonder if thatsa possible. I bet you have to know my social security number or some thing. but the university knows it. I wonder if the computer is like timing me or something. my mom would be really proud of me for doing this she doesn't think I know what I'm doing when it come to computers. my roommated will also be impressed when she come home from whereever she is. I bet this would be a lot harder to do in that class room with 000 people. iwould probably start writing about the people around us. by the time I finish a sentence I've already thought about 00,000 other things. I wonder if other peoples are going to be like this. they are probably going to talk about something worthwhile. I used to think it was worthwild. I hear voices outside my window I wonder if they can see me. they're probably saying that girl looks at th e keyboard when she type instead of the screen. wow time is going by really fast, I only have like 0 more minutes. I wonder what will be done with this and if I will ever see it again. where the hell is lindsay? I think I'm starting to get a crick in my neck. I have 0 more minutes. computers are pretty fun I wish I didn't have such early classes. I keep thinking some one is going to knock on my door. geez my suitemate is really weird. I wonder what she does. damn almost all my thoughts from 00 minutes recorded. that is pretty cool. shoul;d I read over it? 
__label__label0 In high school I felt smart. Now I just am a face lost in the crowd. There are so many peole-so unfamiliar. What will I do?  All my friends went to different colleges. The only new people I know are my roomates-and they all have friends from high school to hang with. I feel like an outcast, like an ugly, fat, freshman, high schoolish girl. Even in my pledge class, all the other girls know each other from camp or home or watever. I have made friends though. I feel like my story is a depressing one, but I really am a happy person and I am enjoying college-being away from home. I thought that coming to college I would somehow escape the whole social thing. Obviously there is no escaping society. I was a Debutante, Neches River Festival Grand Lady-in-waiting, Senior Class Vice-President, and so much more. I was shown in the "higher" society. I hated it some, I liked it some. I guess I mainly liked the in control feeling and the attention. I went to public school, not private like most all of the people who came here from LOCNAME, so I really am not friends with mopst of the people I know. The girls I know-from home and in my pledge class-all live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I live in Towers. There again, I feel like an outcast. I feel that somehow these girls look down on me. It seems like all the girls from PROPNAME house are all so close-and I am not allowed to be a part of their "group. "  Sometimes I just want to go home and be with my friends-where I felt I belong. I am excited to be in college, but-now I'm crying-but anyway, I just feel too young. But going home would show a weakness-I can't go home-I can't show that I want to or have an interest. I have always been the strong hard-headed type that doesn't show emotions. I was sick of being at home-I like it here, but it's hard-school that is. I want to do good in school and show my parents and grandparents-that I am a worthy person and I can survive-on my own. I really am happy, but I guess it is just cold feet. It is just going to take some time to adjust and become a sociable person, again. I know I can do it-make my grades and everything-even if it means giving up a party, or two or ten. I will make it and I will succeed. I am forever changing and growing up, but I need to find who I am -as an individual and on my own rather than hide behind the shadow of my comfort zone. 
__label__label0 I don't have to right in paragraph form or write any sentence structures or even spell right. I don't have to put any grammar or punctuation on this assignment and I can talk about anything. I don't understand what the point of this assignment is and I don't care as long as I finish it. So I guess I'll just keep typing and typing and typing. Right now, I feel an itch so I'll scratch my arm. I'm typing on my friends computer, so he can't use it for at least another seventeen minutes. I don't think understand the point of this assignment. I could do this: and nobody would care. This assignment is just to type for twenty minutes about whatever I think and I keep thinking this over and over again. I don't know what I'm doing and I don't care as long as I finish. I started at 0:00p. M so I'll stop at 0:00p. M. Man it's another fifteen minutes until I finish. I'm tired and I want to go back to sleep. I need to do my laundry, clean the bathroom, do my homework. That reminds me I have so much homework to do. I don't understand anything in calculus and I'm worried about that class. My final is fifty percent of my grade!!!!  I don't understand why some teachers would do that. It's like the semester grade depends on this one test. If you were making an A in the class, before the final, you could end up failing if you really screw up on the final. What kind of class is that???  I don't know but I'm scared. I have to study hard for that final, but first I have to understand the material we're covering right now. I'm so behind. But the good thing about the final is that it's my only final and I have a week to study for it so I should do O. K. I hope I get a B in this class. I don't want to do any homework, and that reminds me that I'm behind in all of my classes!!!!  I have to read so much and I don't like to read. I think I'm going crazy. I need to write this assignment do the second writing assignment, read for Theatre, do Calculus homework, read for this class, do a peer review sheet for English, and chores around the house. So much to do, so little time. Only 0 more minutes to go. Oh, and the pretest survey to see what surveys I will be used in, was messed up. I didn't start reading the top of the survey which tells you what answers to fill in until the middle. So I think the survey thinks I'm a girl, since I answered some FEMALE ONLY questions. Except I checked the male box when it asked whether I was male or female. But it kept on asking me questions that were very feminine. I hope I don't get in trouble for that. But I doubt it, since there will probably be other people who will do the exact same thing I did. There's always somebody else. I hope I don't get put into some strange category or something. What I didn't understand about the survey was that why did it ask some of the same questions over again. I think it had to do something with me answering FEMALE ONLY questions. I don't know if that's why but I answered most all of them except this one question that asked if I was more guilty about eating than most girls. I was like: "Hold up, what's going on?  This survey thinks I'm a girl!"  Damn, well whatever it's O. K. everybody makes mistakes and I'm not going to come down on myself because of that. My friends staring at my assignment right now and saying this is an easy assignment. Well I guess it is, it's just that my fingers are tired. I don't want to type anymore, and I have 0 more minutes left. Yippee!!!!  After this I'm going to take a break and then do writing assignment number 0. After I finish that I'll take a nap and start on Calculus. Oh man, so much work to do!!! I should have started earlier instead of playing these first few weeks of school. Well my time's up. So goodbye!!! 
__label__label1 I don't know what to write about really and I have a bunch of other things on my mind. I haven't eaten breakfast yet and I'm pretty hungry, but I fear that if I don't do this now I might never get around to doing it. the assignment doesn't seem to be that difficult, but sometimes I have trouble thinking of things to say. I'm not going to my calculus study session because I think it will mainly be review of what I have already learned in high school. my roommates friend PROPNAME just called and somewhat interrupted my thoughts. I don't think my roommate likes PROPNAME very much but I don't know that for sure. he always calls when my roommate isn't here which to me is a signal that they're not really in sync. when I feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we're in sync with each other. I think that the more time you spend with a person the more you become somehow linked to that person. I've been waiting to read a book for some time now and my friend just finished and gave it to me. I think everyone should read Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do: the absurdity of consensual crimes in our free country by peter mcwilliams. not only is it a very controversial book, but it is also humorous and very informative and educational. PROPNAME PROPNAME has AIDS, cancer, and was using marijuana for medicinal purposes under LOCNAME state law, but was arrested and thrown in jail. I agree with mcwilliams 000% about consensual crime being ridiculous and I think it's wrong that he's in jail now. I got fined $00 recently for parking in lot A00 next to Jester. the parking and traffic administration expects me to park on the other side of red river, or better yet i00. I think this is stupid and am very upset with this,  I plan on writing a letter of complaint to PROPNAME PROPNAME. my parents finally came to their senses and bought me a computer for school. that is one of the main reasons I am able to do this assignment now. I didn't feel comfortable writing these kind of personal thoughts in a computer lab full of other people. my parents got a good computer for a low price and now I can work from my dorm room, so I think everyone is satisfied. I just wonder if having a computer will be another hindrance to meeting new people especially girls. not that there aren't plenty of girls that use computers, but I don't really get out enough as it is. I know it's up to me to make the effort but I almost feel trapped in a situation where I don't meet enough girls or hang around them enough. 
__label__label0 I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 0 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 0, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 0yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my PROPNAME. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to PROPNAME. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 00:00 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 00 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 000G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 00 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 00000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment. Which I'll do tomorrow, because we can't do 0 in one day. Bye                            WRITING ASSIGNMENT 0                             000000000 
__label__label0 I am very attached to her and am having trouble dealing with her not being with me 00/0. We have dated for almost a year and a half and I don't want to date other people, yet I need someone that is physically with me that I can become close to. I call her all the time and it seemed that nothing has changed in our relationship after being with each other this weekend, yet at the same time as much as I want to see her as much as possible, I have so much trouble saying goodbye to her and letting her go that I sometimes think that it is not worth even seeing her. I knew long distance relationships would be hard, but I didn't realize how tough it would be mentally as opposed to physically grueling. We both don't want to date, yet we will have to get used to the fact of not being able to see each other but 0 or 0 times a month for the next 0 years. I am confused and I was told in the first place not to get myself in this position of having a long distance relationship, but we started dating the summer before senior year and I didn't know it would last this long at the time. On one hand I wish I never met her so everything would be easier, but on the same token she is the person closest to me and besides being my girlfriend, she is my best friend. I know if it was meant to be, then it will work out, but for now I don't know what to do. 
__label__label0 what to write?  I am happy right now because I just got a phone call from a  frat that I am going to join. we are having a get together tomorrow and there are going to be strippers!  that should be cool. but I don't know what to wear. I always get nervous about what I should wear. I hope my girlfriend does not find out, even though I will probably tell her, and she'll probably get mad like she sometimes does. I wonder when clay is coming home?  we have to work out tonight, and I still have a lot of Persian how to do. my throat feels better today than it has all weekend. I was really sick for the last three days so I stayed home and watched the 00th anniv. of Planet of the Apes. that was a good movie. I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of LOCNAME. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got. I need to call laila, I miss her. maybe we could all play solarquest. my neck is stiff but I still have 00 minute to write. this takes forever. I wonder when it is due?  I heard the 00th but I am not so sure. I wonder what the other assignment is about. I hope it is not like this. ,  I have a lot to do tonight but I must be in bed by 00. I need all the sleep I can get. I am tired. this is really starting to bore me. what is the point? write down every thought you think. seems creepy. I hope who ever reads this one is laughing and enjoying themselves. some how I doubt it. this is not very funny--it would be though, if I could say it. I hope no one minds all the hundreds of mistakes I made, and if they do, who cares?  what are they going to do?  put in computer jail?  Someone I knew said that all the time. but I can not remember who. I miss PROPNAME. I wonder how she is doing at PROPNAME PROPNAME state. I also miss jena, I really hope I see her before she goes and flies off to LOCNAME. I hope her life is not hard, and I wish here and michael all the best. my ear hurts. four minutes left. I was beginning to feel trapped in time. stuck forever by this computer typing away through all eternity. I am really tired, but I am glad I got this one out of the way. just a couple of minutes left. that woman at the dinner was so weird. and what about her HUGE 0 year old?  that was scary, but so is "Walt" so I guess it is okay. Well time has run out and now it is time to go. that took forever. 
__label__label1 This comp science lab is pretty nice and I'm kind of confused about what to say or do here. I mean I've been thinking about all this stuff lately and now that I come to write stuff down nothing really comes to mind except filler, you know, the kind of random thoughts you think that don't really mean much at all, I mean look at this thing I'm typing right now!  I didn't make the band but that's ok I guess more time for Geology 000 and PROPNAME isn't in it either so its all good. I want to go swing dancing tonight but PROPNAME isn't there (well and PROPNAME's line is busy so its kind of bunk) cause I take the bus, but it doesn't run as late as I'll be out.  Anyway. Um well lets see I guess I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm like thinking and stuff. Actually I'm wondering if anyone will ever read this, so I'm somewhat apprehensive: I've been thinking some pretty damn personal stuff lately so I don't really want to broadcast on the World Wide freaking Web. I also just typed a profanity and replaced it with a euphemism. I guess that's in case someone actually reads this too. PROPNAME. Hehehe that was cryptic, wasn't it??  See I'm kind of giving a vague notion here. I just type what I think. So there you have it. Wow Five minutes and my wrist feels funny. the FAC Typing things. keyboards, I mean. they aren't very ergonomic if you know what I mean and the surface of the desk kind of hurts. Replace Keyboard. Well it looks like PROPNAME is getting into this assignment, too. which is really kind of cool when I think about it. It will be interesting to me to actually go back and read the thing, cause I'm always editing what I write but now I'm just kind of going forward. relax. I don't know let me see well I'm kind of hungry, isn't that like part of the Id?  I always heard about that-- you know, along with Superego and stuff hey check it out I just read the instructions while I was typing that line and I didn't even miss any keys. Not bad eh?  This is kind of odd for me in another way, too  because I'm a Linguistics Major and well see I know most of the stuff they teach in 000 already, but the Professor seems cool enough. No more high school. Ten minutes to go. Living at home is ok. I can take the metro bus. PROPNAME is cracking up. If you read his (That's "Kay, PROPNAME") you probably shouldn't count it as much cause I can hear him stop typing to re-read what he already wrote and that's not ver continuous, now is it?  I hope I have enough money for food this week. $00 has to last me. I hat this space bar it sucks a lot. You have to hit it real no really hard just to make it go. see what I mean??  I hate it when people use adjectives instead of the proper adverbs. How hard is it to put on a little anyway?    My generation doesn't care, I guess. She's so smart. In fact she went to PROPNAME when she was a Junior in High School. Damn it I get mad just picturing her somewhere else having fun with someone else. But its cool I don't have to worry. or so I say. how could someone so Awesome be alone for long?   No no no. I only see her once a week. It will never work. Okay. well no I'm better. I didn't mean to go all mushy, in fact I'm thinking about going back and deleting that stuff. you know, in the name of science and all. Isn't that weird how I use the second person?  As if I actually expect it to enhance readability or something!  I guess I'm trying to make this whole thing like a VERY one sided conversation. Click click goes the happy little keyboard. My fedora is on the table. I learned the other day that its a PROPNAME Hat from LOCNAME and not really a fedora but its all good because I still think it looks good. People think I'm funny wearing a fedora all the time, but I don't care. They can just piss off. I get lots of ORGNAME ORGNAME jokes. Loss. I'm at a loss here. Ever since that paragraph where I talked about her it got all funky and now its happening again. No. I have a striped shirt on that's white and burnt orange but nobody said anything. I guess that's ok but I thought it was really nifty. 00 minutes seems like a long time at first but then I guess when you get to the end of it its not really  WELL DAMN PROPNAME is looking at my screen, that bastard. I had to stop typing for a sec to make him look away. I guess he didn't see anything deeply embarrassing. rrHahahah  Well times up. I want my cookie. 
__label__label1 I feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes, but at the same time am overjoyed to be here. I spent a year at PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME for my freshman year of college and liked it alright, but the school was not right for me, I think it had more to do with the town than the school, but anyhow I like being in LOCNAME and love being around old friends, but at this moment I feel as if I haven't gotten into the school year just yet. I haven't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient, worthless. But I don't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year. Two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me. Right now I feel relaxed, relieved to be through with classes today. tomorrow is another day and I feel like I have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished. Another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment. This is the first day I have been able to get into the ORGNAME computer library and luckily I made it in before the deadline. I tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines. These are SO much better than the computers from SFA that I think I shall nut my pants. one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles, such as uncapitalized letters, lack of punctuation, all borders are allowed to be crossed and I love this freedom. I am feeling very good about myself right now I have just completed my first assignment of the year, well almost completed. I hope I have done this right and this has actually been fun. I look forward to writing on this assignment again. I have 0 more minutes to write I think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer . I am thinking about how this will be graded . I wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what I am writing in real time. and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not . I think I may stay here all day I like doing work and doing work well I am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that I may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors. I love school what else do I need to accomplish? I have to sign up for some experiments as well I'd best do that also. I am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed. I think I have wrote enough but am not sure. so anyway I am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime. this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced? experienced, and to learn how the brain works is good to, and to learn how the world works , that's good to  I love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane, I am wishing I had a disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style I like it I am going to do it again, . goodbye I am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes. I wonder what I will wish I had accomplished when I look back ten years from now. like I look back and wonder when did I think I would be right now ten years ago? hmmm that's ponderous man really ponderous. I am glad to be here rather than home because at home I can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that I have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes. like if kori came over I would never do homework again. yeah. 
__label__label1 this is really weird. what am I doing here. what am I supposed to write about. who came up with  this assignment anyway. well whatever. ill just do it and ill get the credit and that's it. I wonder where nauman is right now. I called him but no answer. where could he be. I had fun this weekend. I think. well it was better then what I normally do, stay home and watch tv. I wonder what PROPNAME and LOCNAME are up to. I don't spend anytime with  friends anymore. I want to go back to LOCNAME and see everyone. well I guess I can do that this weekend when I go back. its hot in here. its so hot everywhere. well actually I don't want to go back home this weekend. in a way I do, and in a way I don't. I feel like I'm keeping a journal. oh crap I think my contacts are about to pop out. see if I go home this weekend, then I will be giving up freedom. but if I don't go home this weekend then, my parents will be like why don't you want to come home?  do you like austin that much that you don't even want to come see your family anymore??  which of course is not true. I actually don't like austin. well it smells everywhere in austin. dobie smells, dobie garage smells, ORGNAME smells, ORGNAME smells, everywhere, austin stinks, literally. I wonder how farzana and PROPNAME are at LOCNAME. I'm glad they came down this weekend. otherwise I would have been bored off my butt. you can really count on family to be there for you when you need them. but sometimes it can be really annoying. like my mom, everyday, what did you do, did you go to class, did you eat, what did you eat. it gets on my nerves. but I love her. I guess I am kind of looking forward to going home. I mean I get to see all my friends again. and sabeen is going to ORGNAME so I can say bye to her to before I leave. but I think the hardest thing to do will be the transitions on Friday and Sunday. I'm here now and I want to stay here, not keeping moving again and again. I hate change. and then if I go home this weekend, then ill have to pack and say goodbye to everyone on Sunday, and I hate good-byes. they are so sad and then when I'm say bye, ill want to come back to LOCNAME, and ill hate austin even more. that's why I don't want to go back. this feels kind of good like typing all this. maybe ill start keeping a log or something so I can put all my thoughts in it. my hands are getting tried now. I never realized how long 00 mins really was. how much longer do I have?  0 more mins. great. where in the hell is PROPNAME?  what is he doing?? I'm going to call him after this and see if he's there now. he better be. I miss him. I wonder if he misses me too. I hope so. when is he coming back to austin. I could go see him this weekend, but we both know that's not going to work. his friends are all going home this weekend so he'll want to spend time with  them and his parents are out of town so I'm sure he'll want to go out with  them. but then what about me? What about unlimited weekends??? rrahhh. this is frustrating. I wonder if he is still in love with  him old girlfriend. I think he is. but whatever. I don't care. he can be in love with  him old girlfriend. who cares. I'm just going to let things happen. I mean that is the best way right. you can't make someone fall in love with  you. actually I myself don't know if I really like him. its weird. when I'm not with  him, I really want to be with him and when I'm with him, its just ok. I mean I do like spending time with  him, he's really funny and the time flies when where together, but its just not what I expect it to be. I guess it will just take time. ok 0 more mins. great. that wasn't that bad. I guess ill do the other assignment tomorrow since you can't do both on one day. I have so much to do today. that stupid BA 000 assignment is due today and I have to d the prestesting for psy, but the stupid WebPages isn't working for it. just my luck, since I want to use it, its not working. I wonder if I really have to read those 0 books for class tomorrow. if we do, I'm screwed. I wonder what PROPNAME and charu look like. he talks about them all the time. I wonder if I met them, what they would think of me and what he has told them about me so far. where is he. let  me go call him right now!  should I email him?  Well if I could ever get my stupid email to work, I would. how come he doesn't email me?  oh yeah , wait he does doesn't he. I don't know how he emailed me when he was here. I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was him. I don't think at least. I mean he had a girlfriend and everything going. how did he do it? well whatever it was, I'm glad he did. ok good times up. 
__label__label1 anyway, I have really enjoyed the weather lately. its so wonderful to have some change from the usual hot crap we've been going through lately. I think the weather change is making my life better. I hate the heat. it was so intense this summer. this weekend proves to be an exciting one with many things on the agenda. concerts, barbecue and hanging out with friends are what I'm really looking forward to. I recently broke up with my girlfriend so this whole change of pace has been good to me. things are looking positive and it makes me happy. I'm sure that makes sense. I'm really excited about school this year. I think things are going to go well. I like my classes. I find the nature of the courses to be really interesting. I'm sure that's pretty helpful as well. another helpful thing I've learned is than riding the bus is so much easier than walking to school. oh gosh its 000x's better. wow, this is only 0 minutes of writing. I'm so tired. my contacts are bothering me, the screen is WAY too bright and its way to early. I can still hear drizzle outside my window. in looking at the syllabus, I see that a test is approaching. it would probably be wise to begin studying for it. gosh. I'm hungry. I guess ill give my thoughts on the whole PROPNAME scandal. I think it is incredibly sick in what they are doing to this man. to release the details of an intimate relationship he had to the public is both immoral and degrading to society. I feel for his family and the torment they must be going through. I would hate to be in chelsea's position right now. this must be so tough for her to read and go through. damn that ken starr - nazi asshole. I'm offended that he would go to great lengths to find out about the presidents sex life. if they impeach PROPNAME, I'm going to be extremely worried about the country. I don't feel al gore is an appropriate leader at this time. who know, however. he may be suitable. I just think it would all be really stupid if this crap continued on. the starr report was so graphic. it sounded like an explicit porno. wait. it was. too bad it was real life. I'm glad nobody is going to read this. its a stupid waste of time. haha, just kidding. wait. if I tell a bad joke. and nobody is here to read/hear it. is it still bad?  INCREDIBLE. I'm an amazing human being and I'm glad to be alive!!!!!  "I can't take much more of this. these coffee makers full of piss. these people treat my like a dog. and all I do is write these songs.

JUST SAY NO. yea. uh huh. one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute . done. 
__label__label0 I thought the whole thing was ridiculous. Most of the questions were so obvious. I was getting frustrated at how dumb some of those questions were getting. They might as well be asking us to recite the alphabet. I can understand wanting our opinions about things, but they should have reworded their questions. Some of those questions made my roommate and I feel kind of stupid to be answering them. Anyway, right now I actually have a lot of things on my mind. I'm homesick, concerned about my classes, and excited about college all at once. I'm adjusting quite well to such a big change in my life. At first, I was constantly lost, frustrated, and worried, but I'm doing much better now that I've met so many people and overcome so many of my fears. I'm not sure what else to write, but I'll continue simply because it hasn't been 00 minutes. I'm loving UT right now, and I'm definitely glad I came here. My roommate and I get along great. We have a lot in common. We just work so well together. 
__label__label0 I am worried about how I can save my $00 until the end of September. I need to buy 0 books and groceries and personal stuff. I am thinking that I need to find a part time job somewhere on-campus very soon. I also feel guilty about not going home to my family over Labor Day. I know I should visit them but every time I spend long periods of time with them ie. days, they really start to piss me off and then I get into a bad mood. So instead of going to visit them over Labor Day I think I am going with some friends to visit some friends in LOCNAME. I miss my friends back home. This school is really big and sometimes I feel all alone. My classes are starting to stress me out, especially my rhetoric and composition class. I cannot write very well so I probably won't do well in that class. I feel like I'm writing in a diary which is wierd because I've never kept a diary contains all my thoughts and feelings. When I was little and had a diary I just wrote what I ate for lunch and who I sat and played with at reces or who I had a crush on. I just found a bobby pin in my hair from last night. That's kind of embarrassing, I hope no one saw it. I'm supposed to keep writing for ten more minutes but I don't really know what else to write. I have to e-mail my mom, cousin and some friends later. I hope my friend doesn't have to go to jail. No one has heard about his trial that was the other day. Maybe I'll call them later on and find out what happenned. I am so hungry. I can't wait for lunch. I son't know why I've been getting cravings for salty foods because usualy I would always look for ice cream, but lately I've had cravings for chex mix, pizza, chips and stuff like that. I hope I filled out the right pre-testing survey for psychology because I saw a button you click on in this web page, but this isn't the one that I went to. I forgot to bring a pencil with me. I wonder what my ex-boyfriend is doing now. I still miss him even though he was a big jerk and I really don't want to get back with him. I think people will always have feelings for their ex'es even long after they've broken up. I miss my sister too. We never really got along until about 0 or 0 months ago. I feel bad about never really being a nice sister. I always teased her and I knew it hurt sometimes. I wrote her a letter before I went to  college. I hope she's read it. I think I've been writing for 00 minutes but I'm not sure so I'll keep writing for two more minutes. hmm. well this kind of makes me feel better to let all of my thoughts out instead of keeping most of them inside my head. 
__label__label0 College is awesome though, there is no doubt about that, but it is a little hard to handle well, but sick is an even bigger challenge. I never knew how fun college could actually be, it is crazy. There are so many new people to meet and make friends with, some are nice some not, but hey that is always how it goes. I grew up in LOCNAME so finding my way around campus is really no big deal for me. It actually is really nice, because I know my way around the entire city, and plus my parents are here just in case I really need them. Plus the fact that it is easier for me to get money that it is for most people. Another bonus about having grown up in LOCNAME is the fact that I don't have to change my doctor or anything like that, which came in very handy  this week, with me being sick and all. The one thing that bothers me the most about college is the pressure to fit in. I'm in a sorority and absolutely love it, but what I don't love is the fact that when we go to parties, every guy there tries to hand you a beer, and for someone who normally doesn't drink it can get kind ORGNAME annoying. But even worse is the fact that I start to feel like there is something wrong with me because I am not drinking. Like I should be and because I'm not that I am just the weird girl. It is hard for me because I don't want to compromise my moral and religious beliefs, but I continue to find it harder and harder to say no when someone asks me if I want something to drink. It is a very weird and torn feeling, and when I do drink I feel really guilty about it. The one thing that I don't understand is why people think that they need to drink in order to have a good time. After all, most of the time they don't even remember to good time that they had. I myself know that I am having just as much fun as everyone else when I am sober. I am continuing to struggle with this subject daily. I am out of the comfort zone of my high school friends. Friends who believed the same things that I did and that didn't feel like they had to drink to have a good time. I  miss them so much, even though I am making new friends here, I still wish that I could see my old friends every day, because just by looking at the expression on my face they can tell when I need a hug because I'm having a bad day or that I just need someone to talk to. It takes a while to form deep relationships with people because no one wants to open up right away and let themselves be vulnerable, they are afraid that if they do it will come back to haunt them, I'm guilty of the same things. It is just going to take time to make really good, deep friendships here at college, but I think that I am on my way. I often wonder if other people are feeling the exact same way that I am. If they are nervous, timid and scared. I guess that is really stupid to ask because I know that they are. I find it so strange how life takes turns that you never would have expected. It is never predictable and never quite goes the way that you have planned it to go. When I first applied for college I swore that I was going to go out of state, but low and behold I changed my mind and here I am  at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. God himself is just incredible, especially when he throws little things into your life, weather it is for the good or the bad you know that it is in his plan. If you ever really stop to think about what would have happened if you didn't meet one person, how many other of your friends would you have never met. I just don't understand how people can think that there is not a higher power looking over us, because from where is sit today, everything that has happened in my life, and the people that I have met, I know are more than mere coincidence, much much more.    
__label__label0 what a waste of time. These guys are so hung on the fact that they can't decide whether they want to be this one or that one or if they can hack it. How stupid. it is really loud in the other room and I hate when people have their deadlocks one and leave the door open so it always slams when it closes. What should I do about mike? It is a really confusing situation. I wish that gabe would ask me out again. Smoking is bad. PROPNAME just asked PROPNAME PROPNAME if he wanted to go smoke and it's gross. To relieve stress about all this frat shit. Racism is bad. I don't understand why can't people just respect the fact that everyone is not going to be the same color as them. I am open-minded about it because I lived over seas and sometimes I wish that people would be able to have this experience so that they could understand  a little bit about another culture. You learn a lot about your lifestyle and your own country when you are not surrounded about it the whole time. But right now I don't feel surrounded. PROPNAME is still probably crying over his ex-girlfriend and I feel his pain I have been through that before with PROPNAME, I wish here was here a lot of the time but I guess he isn't. he is probably with carley having sex which sucks for me to be thinking about because I think she is a really bad influence on him. I just hope he takes care of himself and doesn't screw up too bad at ORGNAME since he already screwed up by even going there. Imagine that . to be an Aggie that would suck but I guess in a sense I am being prejudice against the ORGNAME. They are a whole different culture but I hate to be called a hypocrite. Someone called me today and it was my best friend in the whole world. Cole is the man. I miss him so much and a lot of the time  I wish that I has a friend as close to me here as he was to me. He is at westpoint and I feel bad for him, no sleep and lots of pressure to do well. I hope he is ok. I miss him and he needs my prayers, which I need to do. I got to get back into the swing of things,. I would be letting Cole down if he knew where I am at with God right now, he is my accountability partner and I feel as though I am letting him down by not studying the word. I will probably go to LOCNAME on Tuesday though and hopefully I will take someone with me. Maybe PROPNAME will go. I hope so, I wonder how sarah and wade are. I miss seeing here and was pretty mean sometimes. brad on the other hand seems very worried about his job and I scared for him! We clicked really well at work and I wish we could spend some quality time together sometime but I don't know what he has been up to ?  I got to go to bed soon. I was very stupid about waiting till the last minute to do homework but I do it all the time and I don't know why I surprise myself every time that I wait until the last minute to do stuff. speaking of which I need a job. where the heck am I going to get a job. I need money to pay for crap that I don't need, Like sweats and shoes that I would add to the collection of almost 00. PROPNAME just walked in the door and I knew because I recognized her voice. She is weird but in a great way. only 0 minutes I think. it seems like twenty minutes is such a short time when you are babbling your thoughts to a computer. PROPNAME is weird and he has this annoying laugh that drives me nuts. So does PROPNAME but PROPNAME's is cute, or am I just trying to justify it because I think I like him. probably I do that a lot. I can convince myself that something is good when it isn't and the exact opposite. It sucks. I never know whether to believe myself or not to. Just like when I talk about sex, I don't want to have sex until I am married and I have made a  commitment to not only myself and God but to my future mate. Wow that is scary. thinking about marriage. " just what every girl dreams of. their wedding day. " But I hate to be out in the category 'every girl' I am my own person and I feel like I am unique. 
__label__label0 I'm really behind in school work right now. I have been working so much that I have put school work aside. I have a lot of things to buy and not enough money for everything. I'm wondering if I really need to buy a mask for my scuba class. that means I would have to invest ninety bucks in a mask and at least twenty for the snorkel. another thing that makes me really mad is that I just bought those flip-flops today and somebody stole them. that makes me so mad, it's like nobody has any integrity anymore. I don't understand every time I find something in a store I always turn it in. that's  the way I would like for my things to handled if I left them. it just makes me mad. sure, they were on a super sale for ten bucks, but still, that is not the point. I wonder where my honey is at. oh yeah he had a flight meeting to attend. I wonder when he'll be back. it's already nine. okay, let's think, what do I have to do tonight. I have to finish up my economics homework, gosh I have to get at least a b in that class. I also have to get a good grade in this psych class. I wonder who's right outside, they sure are making a lot of noise. oh yeah, I have to do good in this class because I need it for my sequence to apply to the school. so I have to finish up this homework and then do eco. I'm glad I don't have to worry about digging up all the answers since I already found a bunch of them. I have to read for social work and I need to go and buy the sports package. I need to find out what time I have to be at work on Wednesday evening. I don't think my boss understands that my class doesn't let out until five and she wants me at work by five thirty, she's crazy. gee, I'm really thirsty. gosh, I have got to get back into homework. I have a test in sw on the 00. I have so much reading. I hate reading especially about research stuff. I think the only reason I'm caught up in psych is because most of the reading is pretty interesting and so is the prof. and economics, I guess I'm just afraid to fall behind in that class. so my goal for the evening   will be to get all this psych stuff done and economics and get through the chapter in social work. that shouldn't be too hard. I kind of like that PROPNAME isn't home but I'm getting worried about him. if he were here then I probably wouldn't' be getting this done. on the other hand he has plenty of physics and calc to do also so I guess we'll both be getting school work taken care of tonight. I'm so excited that I'll get to go to one of the football games this year. at least I'll feel like a normal college student for a day. I wonder how that slip that I just bought fits. I have yet to try it on. I bet PROPNAME will love it but he will just have to wait. gosh, I'm hungry. what did I eat today, oh yeah I ate Chinese. I really have to get in touch with bob.  I feel so bad that I haven't contacted him. I need to extend my condolences to his family. I bet his poor mother must be miserable without her husband. I don't know what I would ever do if I lost PROPNAME, that's because we're not even married. 
__label__label0 I have too much to and not enough time to do it. I hate feeling stressed. I really wish that I could just snap my fingers and have everything be done for me. When I get like this I can't concentrate on anything else. I feel like I need to just start doing the things I need to do and everthing will be okay. I am also really tired, and I know that I am not going to be getting much sleep anytime soon. I am frustratd about my computer. I need toget everything hooked up but I have to wait until someone helps me. My roommate is very messy and I think I will not be able to handle it for much longer. I wonder why my parents haven't called, and what my boyfiend did last night. I am excited about this weekend. I can't wait until the football game. I am nervous about a Pre-cal quiz. I need to get a hold of my professor, but I don't know if I can. I also need to start reading. Too much to do and not enough time to do it. I should of prepared earlier. I'm trying to think about what else is going through my mind and I'm having troubles doing so because that's all I'm thinking about. I'm wondering how hard my classes are going to be. I am excited about this class and my speech class, but not chemistry and Pre-cal. I am reallt worried about my Pre-cal class I need to go to tutoring or something. I have 0 more minutes to type. I feel like I am different from some of the girls in my sorority, and that scares me. The whole sorority thing is overwhelming. Once everything gets started things could get better. I feel like I am writing in a diary that people are going to read. I think I worry too much. I wish that life could be easier. I feel sorry for my parents. I hate community baths. People should not be so gross and messy. I really just want to go back to bed. This assignment is done. 
__label__label1 First of all, I guess would be my nervousness about school. There are several things that tie into that. I don't have a group of friends here yet that I can trust and I'm always nervous around strangers. The guy I really like asked me out, but then acts as if he's not interested. I miss home. I miss the "power" of being the big dogs at school. I know that thousands of people have felt the same way, and thousand more will feel this is the future, but it's so different when it's really me. I guess I never thought I would be the one in college. Another thing is that I'm the only person to come here from my high school in three years, so all the friends I have here now are ones I met here. One thing I do like about living here is that I have a opportunity to be my own person. I don't like being judged, and here there isn't anything on which someone could base a judgement. I also like not having to tell Mom where I am going, and stuff like that. I'M INDEPENDENT!!! I have the rest of my life to be alone. Right now I have no idea what I want to be or what my divit is. There are a lot of occupations I would like to try but most of all I want to make a difference. A BIG difference. I'd like to try truck-driving, cattle ranching, and I'd like to work at LOCNAME. Most of all I think I want to be happy. I think that's the most important thing you can do for yourself. Way back in the back of my mind are Hook' Em tryouts, and the fact that I try out this next Friday, and I haven't made up a skit for it yet. That's freshman procrastination for you!! Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed of all that ORGNAME is and stands for. It's kind of awe-inspiring to think of all the people that have gone here, it's tradition, and it's links to the future. My kinds could be here one day. That's a lot to be on one person's mind, but hey you're the one that asked. 
__label__label1 okay well here goes nothin' I guess so whats the big deal about all this anyway all I was told was about how hard it ws going to be and so far its been a boat ride we used to play dominoes back in high school in my theatre class and I was the only white kid it was kind of fun actually they all taught me how to play "bones" a boat ride was when all the dots on the end dominoes added up two twenty boat ride and so on well its great so  far mom party party party class party party party sleep class party that's my schedule why does this girl keep taking us so seriously I'm so frustr. with her right now oh well sobeit and so on so how much tim e . damn fifteen minutes left what else would you,like to know sir. maam. it whatever is this here to entertain you or for you to. nevermind well here we are just me and you pizza sounds good Kilgore Trout I need to finish that book great book so much crap noone sees the genius and so on the severity of any problem is measured by the attainability of its solution-me yeah psych class 000 people huh and not a damn one is anyhting like me maybe one okay two or three but thas all jammed my finger it hurts to type falling down the stairs at my dads my party drunk 0 in the morningjammed my shoulder and finger price to pay for a good time huh? well answer me nevermind should I tell her what I'm thinking maybe not I ve got plenty of time plenty of time PROPNAME PROPNAME he used to sing PROPNAME PROPNAME no more I could not as good as real thing greatt album best of all time U0 crowding my space!!!! okay well are going to give it back for some reason I don't miss it at all I guess I'm hungry griffin liz maybe other girl one of these things is not like the other hot in here workstastion blah blah cuts handsneed new band for my wtch planner aol disk I tired band I wish theyd make it big like daisy I wish daisy'd make it bigger shopping no wait witherspoon. should I go to the concert or the game. the music or the sport that is the question LOCNAME. its all about the show but who know s what show will blow through a town that goes. never again will I write a poem short story etc. maybe a sports article when I'm old and grey and have no teeth and a dog named ralph with my wife having passed away thrre years earlier in my newly finished rocking chair that my grandchildren made for me and the cushion for my arthritic back. orthopedic shoes pipe in hand and caxcer in mouth calling ralph to my feet watching reruns of the X-files praying to God that one of my kids would call to hear a voice or that ralph could talk if that's his name cause wont remember a thing but that's okay because the one thing I will remember is PROPNAME PROPNAME and so on times up  
__label__label1 Two people, both human in their thoughts--both flattering and otherwise--probably can tell what the other might be thinking yet they refuse oh, fuck it, this is a boring fucking topic, let's move on. She flew in front of the rushing, in front of the huge tidal wave that sucked up the ocean and spat it out like a great hydrant unleashed. Everywhere were sparks of water drops, falling all around as if the sky had let some of its most prized stars fall to the earth for a short while. Pumping harder and faster in and out of the water like the wheels of a railroad made of air and invisible fire that could burn. So quickly was the pumping that the body never knew exactly when it was in water or air but letting the mind rest so that it didn't have to think about the possibility of its limbo state. Higher, faster, higher, faster, stretch, stretch, stretching for something with the next heave. Perhaps beyond this star-surrounded existence there was something more, something past the huge roaring of a thousand waves chasing. If the body could just stretch a little more, jump higher, breath with the vigor that said "what's next?". something might answer back. The sun would set itself on the sheet of a mirror made of those drops of stars and welcome the body and the attached mind into the core of-- of what?  Faster still, plunge, plunge, plunge to the rhythm of the thousand and one gadgets held somewhere between the awkward wave machine and the diving body. Maybe the answer was somewhere behind the body, maybe if it would just stop long enough the gadgets would swallow it up, the flat cold would open its innards and let the body know that all the time what it was leading was the salvation, the euphoric "YES!" it was looking for. But too much of a chance, the gadgets were probably chasing after the sun just like the body was. If not then why was it always following the dolphin forward. The dolphin continued its unceasing breath. Felt the crash, the massage, the spank, the kiss of the sea as it plunged under once again. Where was the sun?  Why didn't it show itself?  Faster, faster, enjoying to the fullest the sound of a thousand gidgets singing in a rhapsody of mixed chorus like the sound of the wind against the leaves and sand of those strange dry places where creatures coo and lie in the sun. Chasing the sun; if only the dolphin could call it. The dolphin was sure it didn't see it now. A few bleating cries, mixed with loneliness and bittersweet joy, the loneliness from being just behind the gears that all shared in their lives together and worked as if one, the joy of those drops, those thousand, star-filled drops that seemed too beautiful and quick to stay on the mirror waves long. The joy too, of feeling the waves rush up and pull and then give and pull and give all the while trying to stay just above, just beyond, further and further away if only to KNOW. For if life chasing the sun proved this-- this-- MUCH; this fullness that almost filled the body and the attached mind until it could almost hold no more except for that damn persistent hole that often slid part of the fullness down, then can one imagine what life in the sun might prove to be?  Bathed in the stars that only manage to peek out every once in a while in the disguise of sea foam?  Full of that diving feeling without having to take rushed breath?  Part of those lucky gadgets that can never envision loneliness because they are constantly surrounded by the humming that they make together in chorus?  The sun is slipping now, disappearing too quickly, lungs almost tear in the attempt to keep up, tail flipping sporadically, waves going by so fast they feel like hot coals searing the flesh. No, no, no, NO!  Gone now, a last sliver to leave in the mind of the dolphin to remind the body tomorrow, if the sun comes down to gather up its star-drops, of how close it came and how one day it would find a shortcut, a way to escape the in between limbo that held just enough splendor to incite the imagination. Deeper now and beside the humming gadgets who now are singing a softer chorus, like the cluck-cluck of a mother to child to soothe it to bed. This was the best part of the day, the calmness afterward, the coolness, the memories and the dreams. "Hey dad?" "Yeah?" "Why do dolphins swim in front of ships?" "Hmm, I dunno'" "They're beautiful, huh?" "Yeah, they sure are. " "I love the way the sun reflects off their skin. " "Yep. "     
__label__label0 Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. PROPNAME, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 00 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy "Titanic. "  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her "No. "  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will "turn into" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     
__label__label0 I tried to clam her down before talking to her about what was wrong. When I finally got a complete sentence out of her she told me that a girl who I was friends with, well we weren't like best friends or anything, but I had two classes with her and talked to her everyday, had been killed in a car accident earlier that day. I sat there for a second not even realizing what she was saying. When I got off the phone I went to my mom and told her very matter-of-factly what had happened. The next day I went to school not knowing what to expect, but after having been in class for only a short while and hearing my teachers and principal attempting to explain what happened and try and calm everyone down I was bawling. That's when it hit me, I just didn't understand it. Walking into the classrooms which I had shared with her only the day before was the weirdest feeling, I could see my other classmates in the hall and as they reached the classroom, some screamed, some wept and some just turned and walked away very quickly. The following days were exhausting, I don't think I had every cried that much in my life. I couldn't be at home alone, I don't know what I was afraid of, except just having time to think about it. Despite the hurting that I and the others that knew her felt, I was happy for her. She was in a better place, she was an awesome person and I have no doubt that she is in Heaven now. The funeral was huge it felt like our entire school was there. Her closest friends, including her boyfriend who was driving the car that day, all got up and told funny stories about her and how awesome she really was, that was comforting, but also extremely hard to listen to. At the intersection where she was killed people gathered at all hours of the day and night, it was a very saddening sight to see all of her friends just staring at the cross surrounded by flowers, her favorite candy and pictures, which still stands there. When I went to the cross all I could do was stare at the street and the markings which the police had made only a short time before. After the funeral I only went to her grave once and that was after attending my neighbors funeral, they were buried practically next to each other. It was all I could do to keep my attention on the service. When the time had finally come for my to walk over to her spot, I was fine until I faced it directly and saw her picture laying among the flowers and notes everyone had left. I lost it, I almost fell, but my sister caught me. I was a mess. I wrote her countless letters that never made it to the cross or to the site, but I know she knows how I feel and that comforts me. I pray for her family and close friends all the time, it was hard enough for me I can't imagine what it was like for them. 
__label__label0 I feel a bit stressed due to the fact that my first three tests are all next week. What will they be like?  Will I do well?  Or, will I enter the large classroom, with a crowd of students all cramming in the information for those last final moments before the test and freeze after spending countless hours preparing. The new environment is wonderful, however many changes come along with it. The first test of the year, the first test at college. Each exam seems to have much more bearing upon your grades than in the past. Some thoughts about how I'm going to go about studying have crossed my mind over the past few days. These hours have most likely been wasted, as I could have been studying or reading material which will be covered on my tests. However, this is not quite the way I always function. I often tend to spend too much time worrying about how I will go about doing something, rather than just doing it. Anyway, I spent a couple of hours studying today and I have figured out what time of each of my days between now and Wednesday, and how each precious moment will be spent. I'm sure it will all work out, but until these first three tests are finished, I know that some time will be spent worrying about how the final result turn out. Those are just some thoughts about school which are probably quite typical of a freshman. It's strange to come from the top, back down to a little freshman. It appears that quite a few people have decreased their level of maturity back down to a freshman in high school. A girl I know walked back into her room last night to find her pictures colored on and holes punched in her eyes. Seems a bit disturbing, doesn't it?  There's always the issue of talking to a boy and everyone assuming that your "going steady. "  It's difficult to even go to someone's room of the opposite sex without everyone assuming that you must have been doing something rather than talking. I guess everything, with time will pass. I'm really enjoying the transition, for the most part. It's strange to not see some of my best friends, but this is all part of growing up (Not to sound hokey). So far, it's been lots of fun and a time of many changes. I'm eager to see what lies in the future and continue to make new friends.   
__label__label0 Why do I always analyze things to the point that I completely stress myself out about it?  I find myself doing this time and time again.   I feel stupid, I can't believe that I let PROPNAME set me up on a date with someone that I don't even know. To top that, I barely know her. What was I thinking? The way that she is talking, he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever seen; however, I am really scared that I am going to be really let down. I know that sounds really negative, but I guess it sounds too good to be true. It doesn't make sense to me how this whole thing works anyways. Your sorority tells you about a party that they are having, giving you only two days notice to find a date. To me that is completely weird. I just don't have the guts to go up to some random guy and ask him to go to something that I'm not even sure will be fun myself. Oh well, it will all work out.   Now, on the other hand, I'm all about going to the pledge line tomorrow. I couldn't believe that someone asked me. It made me feel so good inside to know that I was one of the few girls to get asked!    I don't know what my problem is; it just seems like I can't stop thinking about how much weight I think that I need to lose. It seems to be the only thing that I think about any more, and I don't know why. I don't think that there is anything wrong with me, but then again, maybe there is . You never can tell any more.   All I know is that there are so many things going on and not enough time. I wish that my body wouldn't go through such big "swings". One minute I am bursting with energy, and the next I can't even keep my eyes open. It is as if a person is holding onto my heels and making me drag them for hours on end. After dragging them for so long, you just can't drag any more. This tiredness that sweeps over me comes frequently throughout the day, but , without fail, it comes each day between 0pm and 0pm. I want to be like others that are comstantly energetic, skinny, and seem to get everthing done with no problems at all. I guess that is only a perception in my mind that only sees things from the outside instead of how they really are. Does that make sense?     Why can't there be more hours in the day. I feel like ever since I have gotten here, all the time in my day has flown by, and comtinues to fly by without even slowing down. Which is fine with me as long as I don't leace things that are really important to me out. Unfortunately, this is what I have been forced to do because I my new schedule.    Before I came to school, I worked out daily so that I could relieve all of my stess, and feel good all at the same time. Now I can't even find time to get to class--much less work out.   I wonder how PROPNAME is. Is such a sweet little boy. Ever since he was born I have loved those kids, and had a compassion for them that no one else could ever have.    I can't believe that PROPNAME came up to me and asked me about PROPNAME PROPNAME the other day. I mean talk about digging up painful things that have already been buried!! Whenever she said something, every bit of hurt and anger inside of me came back like it was just yesterday that it had happened.   I need to put it past, and forgive and forget. That is at least what I know I am supposed to do, but it is so hard! Why do I get attached to people so easily? That is one thing even I will never know. 
__label__label1 bored. I'm supposed to be going out on a saturday night, but I'm not. it's a saturday night and I'm sitting in front of a computer, instead of at the Roxy with all the sororities. maybe it's good because I'll finally be set on the track of that good work thing my mom's been talking about. mom's upset.

__label__label1 Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my hometown of LOCNAME, LOCNAME, where I get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. I guess I'm looking forward to the weekend, however I realize that I am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at LOCNAME. Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time. To tell you the truth, I really don't know why I do. One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. I just saw the ORGNAME music awards, which was ok. I mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. Some bands these days I can hardly consider a "band" in the least sense of the word. I just remembered that I missed my SI meeting tonight. that which I am not too happy about, but I shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. Sometimes I wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. I mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent THAT bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. I've been to other places and apartments, and I think I still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that I recieved. I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. I get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. I'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, I'll be up for a while. Sometimes I wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. In this summer alone, 0 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 0 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. It's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. Luckily I was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. I never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. I mean what can you say?? I'm sorry?  you'll do better next time?? hardly. It feels like I'm typing into a diary or something. which I don't keep. I really want to go see some live bands here in austin. I mean it IS supposedly the Live Music Capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 0th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else I could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. Overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really REALLY cold. man is it cold. I wish I had something to eat as of right now. I'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. Some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. I hate doing laundry. I especially hate ironing. but I guess they're something that I'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. I think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. It just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right?  Some people I know take it way to the extreme. I wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now I'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl?  who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy/girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. I guess it wasnt "weird. " just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool I guess. now I also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that I would be detained by the ORGNAME for some criminal knowledge that I may possess for some odd reason. who knows. 
__label__label1 What am I feeling right now, hmmmmmmm. my consciousnesss. Right now it's the afternoon and I'm feeling pretty hungry. My stomach feels pretty empty and I think I can fill it up w\ a lot of food. My feelings and thoughts are pretty mixed up right now. There is so much going on. My mind is on so many things. there is so much to do. first I'm thinking about a girl that I was with and I left because of school. then I have to get my books for class. I still haven't fit in and I don't feel relaxed yet because of the things I have to do. I'm worried about if my financial aid is ever going to come through so I can pay for the books. Those books cost a lot of money. But this overpowering hunger of mine is really taking up a lot of my thoughts. somehow, though I am able to pull those really tiny thoughts which are really important. Man, I don't know what else. It's pretty crazy that I am here in LOCNAME away from H-town, but next weekend I'll be able to go back home the hunger . man I wish I had eaten a lot earlier, all I had was some lasagna leftover. I can't believe I'm writing or typing for this long and straight because my forearm is starting to hurt. oh well, got to keep writing I hope this psychology class isn't so hard, that pretest was pretty damn long w\ thirty -two pages. the reason why there are no spelling mistakes is because I don't like to have errors, sorry. I wonder what the point of this is? their not going to check it. what are they going to do to this hmmmm. interesting I wonder what I'm going to write to her I miss everybody. my forearm really hurts I want to stop but there's only a few minutes left. right after this I'm going to the pulse and getting my money to get my books. I think UT is awesome, there is so many possibilities. these computers in the business school are pretty awesome too. hurry up time . I like this asssignment though, I like it a lot. I still don't get the freakin' assignments to the freakin' calculus class. I'm glad I was able to  drop English is the twenty minutes almost up yet?!!!! Holy crap. the veins on my forearms are poppin' out. Beautiful babies everywhere pennebaker cool. Hi there. this is me killing time . I have a lot more thoughts but I'm hungry and myforearm hurts. I'm typing w\one finger now. its almost up. this thing makes me sleepy. one minute left. yessss. wwhhhhooooeeee!!let'sgo it;'s over 
__label__label0 When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was "What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?"  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like "What song best describes you?" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 0 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 0 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 0 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel. 
__label__label0 Today I am very tired. Because last night I was up to two am to do my chemistry lab reports. First I thought it was easy and it wouldn't take me so long to do it. But actually it required a lot of consideration and calculations. After I finished writing the report, I found out that the report must be typed. The problem was I don't have a printer at home, and at that time, it was already ten at night. I didn't want to go to the library so late but didn't want to get it done at the last minutes of tomorrow morning. I went to knock at my neighbours' doors and asked them if they had a printer I could borrow. The lucky thing was that the second one I asked does has a printer and he let me borrowed it. So the problem had been solved. Then after this I kept on writing my Chemistry prelimenary write up. I needed put the procedures and data table up. That was a very long lab, there were totally seven experiments I need to do today and it spent me like eight pages for the pre-lab write up. So today morning I went to the lab room and turned in my lab report at the beginning of class. I am glad that I finally got it done, but I don't know what would the grade be since I was in a hurry last night. Then I start to do my experiments. It took me almost four hours to finish and after that I was so exhausted since I didn't eat breakfast in the morning. My data was so messy and I don't know if I could read them when I need to write the lab report again. After the lab, the first thing came up my mind was to go home and have a nice big sandwhich. At one o'clock, I had my math discussion class. I almost felt to sleep during that class since the topic the TA discussed was kind of boring and I already knew them. After this class, I had my Biology discussion class. This class is pretty cool because it took like 00 minutes then we could go home. So I went home and get on the line to have a little rest. I was chatting with my friends, checking email, and surfing until my roommate came back. Then we did dinner together. Tonight's dinner was good and it was the thing I enjoyed the most today!   Ah, two minutes left. finally, so what else I need to say?  So after the yummy dinner I started to write this assignment, and now time is up. I can go on to the next writing assignment. my hands are so tired 
__label__label1 well, topday when I was sitting in the cafeteria, I was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, "congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. "  that was kinda strange because I don't usually curse until I came onto this campus. I have no idea why. he asked me if I did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no I don't. I don't usually curse. the only time I ever did that was if I felt pain or something. I never felt the need to curse and I know that it's a filthy habit. I also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. I can't figure it out. I have noticed that I curse a lot and I've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, I don't really want to because it's fun. I don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion I came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because I know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but I don't care. I have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. I know that it's not but I can't stop sometimes. well, I can but I choose not too. . FIRE DRILLL!!!  oh well. last I left off was awhile ago. I kinda lost train of thought. I don't remember what I wrote and I don't feel like reading what I wrote. now I feel kinda tired because I walked up the 00 flights of stairs. I wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. I'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. I'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, I'll be in big trouble.  a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. I hate to pass judgements and crap like that so I pretend that it's all good. I don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but I did meet them here. I don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so I don't want to say too much. lets just say that I see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. I'm not sure what I'm suppose to write about. I know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am I suppose to write about. the first time I heard about this, I thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and I at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness.  I wonder if I'm out of breath. would that effect how well I think. cause I'm writing this stupid assignment, and I seem to have trouble because I'm thinking too much about breathing. I always have this huge headache. I think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. I don't know. I don't care.  actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because I can just write whatever I want and know that as long as I turn it in, I'm ok. no matter what I say or how I say it, it's all good.  but, when I came in the room after that firedrill, I didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. I'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. I know I have to write for 00 min. and I have another 0-0 min. to go. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired. I'm not even thinking anymore. I got to pee, but I don't want to unless I'm finished with this assignment. man I got to pee. ok, I'm going to end this assignment now that I think I'm done.

__label__label1 Today I have only one thing on my mind. Her name is mary. I met her at this party a while back and we kinda hit it off. I never reallly saw her or talked to her, but the other day I saw her and it was on. I am really worried about tonight. I have a date with her tonight. I hope I don't screw it up. I hope that she likes me as much as I like her. I hope that I don't screw things up. Well whatever happens happens. This is weird I havent really thought about a gitl this much since PROPNAME, I think that I still think about her sometimes. I don't know why I always do, I just do. I thik it might be because I liked her so much. It is funny because I never slept with her. It doesn't matter that much though, I am a fucking liar. I need to stop lying. I don't do it to be mean or anything I just tell little lies and they get big. I need to be honest with everyone. I am who I am I can't please everyone. I think that one of these days I am really going to get myself into some major trouble. wow I can't type as accurately as I would like to type I want to be able to type with no errors but I think that will be immpossible. I feel really guilty about missing class. I have missed to many classes already I know I am better that that I think I will see how long I have been writing now. sometimes I feel really dumb and unattractive. I am going to hook up with Marry I like her a lot dammit and for gods sake I am going to hook it up. I mean that I want her to be around for awhile I am not going to be scarred of this one. ever since about my sophmore yeah in high school I have been really scared of relationships, but I am not going to be any more. I know that sometimes I will get hurt, but that is just the game that we play. If I want to win I got to play the game. I do want to win. I will win, if I keep playing I have to remind myself sometimes that the game goes on. it doesn't stop because you are having a bad day. Well lU think that I have really kinda lert my mind go off. I am kinda hungry and a ciggerete would also be nice. I can't eat though cause I just ate and that would be dumb. I have been smoking less and now I only smoke lights I think that it is a good thing that I am only smoking lights. a pack of reds would be really good. But I have to smoke lights for a while. I must remeber to only smoke when it is cool. I can't smoke too much tonightbecause I don't want to send the wrong message. I think that my typing is getting a little better. Well maybe it isn't I don't know I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I doubt it If they did really read this they would probbably think that it was complete shit. Maybe not. Who knows I wonder why nobody ever emails me. Well I get stupid forwards but they are really dumb must of the time I wonder what the fuck is really going on in the world these days I want to drink a beer or two or three. I want to get laid. I want love, sex and euphoria. I want it all and I want it to be given to me. I don't want to work, I want to float through life. I want things to be easy I want to pursue my hobbies. I want to get paid for listening to records or maybe making them if someone else wants to listen. I think that music has to be hyping yourself. nobody puts out a record to listen to it themselves. they try to make money. well it looks like my time is just about up. Bye 
__label__label0 Hello. My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I'm a freshman this year. So far I love ut and I'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and I actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing I really fear is that I will slack off. I am great at doing my work, and I know that I will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, I have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, I'm not homesick at all. I'm actually doing very well here. I met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that I've come close to two of the people that I met. one of which I am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. I finally gained the confidence in myself and I gained so much to my self esteem. On a normal, day to day basis, I try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever I'm feeling down. My friends and  family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone I love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when I have a problem, and I know that. He's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when I left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, I've recieved about 0 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. I'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. I am so proud of being indian, and I'm also very proud to be part of the family that I'm in. I wouldn't change that at all. I grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. I like growing up there, but I really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way I'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone I need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something I really wanted. I wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. I had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. I love it. I like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, I love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when I went to new york city a couple of years ago, all I wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, I like to live life like that. doing things I by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. I've always been independent and I'm fairly sure that's becuase I take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because I'm the older child. I like doing things on my own, so then I know if I make a mistake, I can fix it. I don't like depending on others all the time, but I love being with people. I know those are two contradicting statements but I do have those that I rely on, and I do consider connections when I need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, I love my life. I can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and I want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and I hope to succeed with great pride. 
__label__label0 The first thought that enters my mind is that I have no idea what I am going to say in this assignment. I have no thoughts or feelings except that I am trying to think about what to say. These types of assignments are difficult for me because I usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. Because I am a guy, sex just popped into my head. Because I am male, I hope I do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. For the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings I will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. This being my first college writing assignment, I am a little nervous that I may be doing this wrong. I must change my previous statement that I am confused. It is more of a fear that I will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. My next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time I had left. Only fourteen minutes left. Yahoo.   I just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. It is not that I like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at PROPNAME for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. I can't wait). I just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. This is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. I just saw an empty Dr. Pepper can in the garbage can and I thought I might like one, but then I realized that I wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. My next thought was that I wish I had a thesaurus right now because I have used the word "assignment" too many times. Excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. It was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because I believe he might go "postal" at anytime. I had a thought before this person came to the door, but I forgot it now. It's okay because I only have to write for seven more minutes. I am wondering what my "Quote of the Day" will be on my board outside my dorm. I want to use a quote from the movie "What About Bob" but I'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. Again, I am having the problem of not knowing what to say. It must stem from my lack of self-esteem. I just glanced at the clock and found that I only have to write for two more minutes. I just realized that I should not have written that down because I could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences. If this "assignment" was supposed to show me how my mind works, I am not pleased with the results. It shows me that my mind does not work that well at all. My only "sensation" in the last twenty minutes is that I have to go to the bathroom     
__label__label0 I really miss my family. School here is fast paced and big. Ice cream was good tonight. Wish I could see PROPNAME PROPNAME I love him he's so cool and fun to be with. I wish PROPNAME would call me why hasn't he called yet?  I wish that I\I had my old bed here with me now I want to have fun I think that I am really tired right now. I need sleep I should be sleeping not typing it's hard to clear your mind because there are so many things to think about how's PROPNAME doing?  I miss her she's so cute I wish I could pick her up and hug her right now. I wish that I weren't in schhol again already. I love the eagles. I'm just running down the road trying to loosen my load got seven women on my mind. what I don't have any women on my mind I guess my mom well I like my screen saver a lot. The elephant sounds and the frog is really cute. I need to eat more regularly. ever since I got here I haven't been eating enough. Am I homesick?  Is it too hard to keep in contact with people here?  yes it is. Too many people. I wanted a big school but I don't think I knew what I was getting into. I just want to be successful  I wan't to meet people and to make lasting and important relationships I want to get married I wish I could sleep and think and not have to stay up doing random assignments that will hav no effect on my life whatsoever. I know that college is worth the trouble but sometimes I wish I didn't have to be here-I didn't have to grow up. I know that everything will work out why has G. J. been treating me like he has I am just an old flame am I boring to him now?  why did last night he say that he was tired and wanted to sleep but then when his friend called he was ready to do something  why does he always have to be so selfish I always do things for othewr people and I w\usually think about him and what he would want constantly am I getting taken advantage of I am sore I have been working out a lot lately. I need to go run and clear my thoughts I wish my bed were here. I hate the new bed. I can't ever sleep. My first monday is tomorrow and I'm not excited about it. whhy/  coffee would be good now I'm a caffeine addict. I love it just like I love gj just like I wish he were here right now. what am I going to do for the rest of the night/ why hasn't jenny called me where are all of my friends?  I miss juli. she's a really good friend. PROPNAME is too why didn't I go canoeing with him yestereday?  should have why do I never want to talk to him anymore do I think that he wants me more than I would like. I still have 0 minutes left. just looked at the clck I hope that's allowed. maybe not but probably is okay because I really was wondering how much time I have left PROPNAME said that he already did his assignment he's a nerd though no wonder he can't get girls to fulfill his needs anthony just called he said he only made 00 bucks but he just rode around on a kayk all day. church was cool anthony should have come witrh me. PROPNAME should come and eat lunch me tomorrow he says he wants too. fun fun. I wonder if I'm going to run out of meals my roommate is on the desk right now she's pretty wierd I've known her since fourth grade and she still seems wierd to me oh well maybe she always will. I wish justrin would call. why wont he? probably has a girlfriend. Like I have a boyfriend that's been treating me like shit that's always nice- love that hate guys sometimes well I have about two or three minutes left. Gosh roommmate is inging now what the hell is felicia singing/  She can't sing. I can sing better than she can. I hope you appreciate reading this if you ever do because it is emotionally straining at this time of night for me to write all of this. Hmm. my 00 minutes is over How time flies when life's a bitch 
__label__label0 I am tired today. I should have gone to bed earlier. I need to study. How much do I need to read for my classes to get A's in them? I have to do my economics homework today. I miss home I miss my family. I have never been away from home for this long. I won't get to see my parents till parents weekend but that will be really nice. I have a fraternity meeting at 0:00. I can't wait until the next football game, the game this past weekend was awesome. I need to wear a hat at the next game cause I got a bad sunburn last weekend. My face hurts from the sunburn still. I wonder when our next fraternity mixer will be. A picture reminds me of my LOCNAME trip last summer. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I have a paranoid feeling that I am not doing enough work or studying, that I am neglecting something. I hate doing laundry, I have already had to do it twice since I've been in LOCNAME. It hasn't rained since I've been here, I wonder when it will rain. I hate the heat and humidity in LOCNAME. I can't wait till it cools down and turns into fall. The girl in my business administration class yesterday was very pretty, maybe I can go on a date with her sometime this semester. ORGNAME merged with ORGNAME, maybe ORGNAME won't be such a lousy network anymore. I need to eat lunch soon. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I hope I will have time to study tonight, I need colored pencils to finish my economics assignment, maybe my roommate has some. 
__label__label1 There is alwaysa thought in out mind, or is there? Do we only think when we are conciously aware of it, or do we think all the time? I ask myself a lot of stange question all the time. I hear the sound of a tennis match on the television. I wonder what the people at the tennis match are thinking? They are watching the game, but are they conciously thinking about it? I am sitting in my friend's dorm room, typing on her computer while she sits watching tennis, and doing calculus. I bet she is too distracted by tennis to actually "do" her homework. That's ok. I am doing well at tuning it out, but then again, I don't really like tennis! I wonder how many people actually like tennis? I really have to use the restroom!I know that came out of no where, but I was thinking about it. You know that if you order things on line, if it's not in LOCNAME, well you have to pay S/H, but if you order a lot it can really save you money. I wish I made more money. I still don't know weather I should quit my current, cozy job, for a new strange one that pays more money? I have established a history, and many friendships at my current job, so why should I leave? But at the same time more money would help me out in the long run. or would I just spend more? That's is what our world seems to be all about making money, and for some, making the MOST money. I don't want to get caught up in the rat race of making money, but sometimes I am afraid that I already have. I should really be more conservative with my money so that I won't worry about having enough. I know that it's a vicious cycle. I wonder, will anyone actually read this? sorry, I ask many questions, I know that they will ever be answered, but I ask anyway. When will we find the answers? Are the answers to many of lifes questions obtainable, or are we never to know?  I think one day we will know these answeres, and we will say, "Wow, the answers were right in front of me the whole time!"  Sometimes I think that we make things too complicated! We should relax and let the answes come to us! That's what many artists have to do to become inspired, if they think to hard, then they can't think of anything! Kind of crazy hu? Well I think that this enough thought for today, have a great day!!  
__label__label0 I am sore, my pecs hurt. hmmmm, I need a woman, I can't find anyone here, all the girls I meet are either ugyl, stupid, or taken, life is beginning to suck. I love UT but I am having trouble finding myself, I am not sure what I am going to do. I have always wanted to be a doctor, but what happens if I don't get into med school. what can I do with a bs in biochemistry? I hate living off campus. by the end of the day, I begin to smell, and I can't get home and take a shower unlike everyone else. I hope my car is going to be fixed by this weekend, things will be so much more convenient for me if it does get fixed. I wish I had gone to an earlier orientation and set my schedle right, I don't lke having 0 hours in between classes. ugh. sigh. I need a woman. I just want someone to hang out with whenever I get bored. right now I can't get into contact with any of my friends, so I have nnothing bettert to do, I am hungry. I want to go home. but I would have to walk fifteen minutes to the stop, wait a half hour at the damn stop, then wait another half hour to get home, then walk about ten minues, then it would take about another fifteen minutes for my food to get ready. ugh. I am bored, I need a woman. I wish I knew how I was percioeved by woman, I don't know if they find me attractive, funny, cute, or anything, I am completly clueless. I wish someone would just comeup and tell me exactly wha they think of me. sigh. lets see, my mouth tastes funny. I wish I had ome food on me. damn. damn, why does v have to have a boyfriend already, she just broke up with someone. I wish she liked me. I hate being "just friends" when I want more. I don't want to type this in the smf, I have an eerie feeling that someone I know is loooking over my shoulder, watching me write this stuff that I wouldnt tell my closest freiends. if she wasnt such a close friend, I think I would tell her, but she is like my best friend, and now I am afraid, no I know, that we wouldnt be friends if I were to tell her, I know she will freak out, heck I ve seen her do it before. I am so depressed. I need a woman. i hope no one is watching me type this, I am getting paranoid. damn I am sore, my back hurts, my arms hurt, and my chest hurts. I need a job. I need a woman. sigh. what should I do with my life, I think my friends don't like me anymore, I am becoming a nuisance to the I think. I tyr my hardest to not mooch off of people, but I always get bad vibes from everyone, like I am not wanted. I am sure that they arent right, I know that the y  are false, but I can't shake the feeling. I try really hard to be as nice as possible to people now, but I can't shake generalizations that people dish out to me. some of my friends think of me as a pervert, even though my mind dosnt think that way. I never think of nastiness or sex, I just mention it every once in a  while for jokes, I have too much time to myselfs. I thiknk thats why I am so insecure, I have to much time to think about my problems and such that I dwell on them, and make small things look big. if I had someone to hang out with whenever I am bored, then I think I would feel much better about myelf, but I find myself walking around campus a lot, and its so hard to get in contact with my friends, that I can't hang out with them. ,. I find myself drifting away into isolation. sigh. 
__label__label0 right now I'm wondering why I am doing this and how it relates to the class  I'm tired and this is not helping get the sleep I need and with my government class too  crap I have to do that for about 0 hours tonight  I'm wondering wheather I hate college or love it or both   I think its both all the people hear and so much to do study party girls ect. my clothes need to be washed tonight they smell like crap. ahh sweet katie is coming up this week how cool wondering what my first football game is going to be like and if I'm going to get any action from kaite PROPNAME my roommate wants to get some snuggle action from katies friend ashleigh   I'm sure he would like more than that though knowing him  ohh yea I hate this crap I'm listening to   hungry like the wolf   got to delete that off my winamp man its so hot in this room  I need to shower for like the 0th time today  this weahter sucks hear  its about 000 degress everyday  thats starting to piss me off too   ahh got to pick up my football tickets tommarow don't want to miss that right frats???? the delt frat party on friday   am I going to go or just hang out in my dorm and what about katie coming up my god I'm sweating I'm my room damn AC!!!

__label__label0 We went to LOCNAME LOCNAME today as a sorority, and met a bunch of my new pledge sisters. I just pledged PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I absolutely love it. Today, we layed out beside the pool, which really has lake water in it,and I nearly fell asleep. When I put my feet in the water, it felt like I had just breaken through the top layer of Ice, and now my feet are in the water below it, like a pond that had been frozen over. It was really neat to see the different type of people that will soon become some of my best friends. Hopefully I will have gotten a tan. Yesterday, I went to the football game and met my boyfriend and his family there. He lives in LOCNAME and is a senior in high school. His brother is one of the starters on  the football team, so it was really neat to see him play. I sat with my boyfriend and his family, which I hadnt seen in a while. Later on that night we went to his brother's apartment and hung out. I was so happy to have seen my boyfriend. He's an incredible guy. Anyways, I could go on forever. My feet really hurt today from these little pieces of wood that were on the ground, and when I walked around with no shoes, it did not feel good. Right now, I am looking around my room and it looks so much different than it did a week ago, when I had not yet pledged a sorority. Everything I have now is zeta stuff. It really is kind of neat. I love being in a sorority. It's really a good chance to meet people and feel a sense of family even when you are away from family. Speaking of family, I really miss my family. My parents are divorced, and my dad lives in LOCNAME. My mom lives in LOCNAME with my two younger brothers. They miss me so much. Especially my dog, who uses the bathroom all over the house just to show us when he is mad or upset with us. My mom said that lately he has been doing that. I guess its because I left him. I always would play with him, such as throwing a frisbee and play tug-o-war. He was so attached to me it was unbelievable. Everywhere that I went in the house, he would follow. I love dogs. I can't wait to go home and see all of them. My brothers really miss me also. They don't have an older sister to boss them around anymore. My mom really misses me too. I was the only daughter, so she was very attached to me. She calls me about 0 times a day, and emails about 0. I guess as time passes by, she will get used to me being gone, but right now I don't think that she has adjusted very well. But I guess that goes for all moms when their children go off to college. And its kind of funny because I was really scared to come here. I have heard its just so big, and the sororities were so cruel. I was frightened. I had always wanted to go to ORGNAME, because I am definitely the more conservative type, but I have amazed myself in that I absolutely love it here. LOCNAME is such a neat town, and there is always something to do. In LOCNAME, we had to sit and figure out something to do on a Friday night. Most of the time, we never came up with anything. Here in LOCNAME, there is not one night where nothing is going on. There's a ton of good restaurants and fun places to go to. Especially LOCNAME LOCNAME, it was a great place to go for a picnic on a Sunday afternoon. I have family down here in Austin, so it is neat to have a place to go. I feel much more secure. They are about 00 minutes away, which is perfect, because they are not too close, but they are close enough for me to drive over to whenever I get sick of the campus. My cousin, who just got back from a mission trip in the LOCNAME, will be living at my aunt and uncles house next year while she is working at a church. It will be neat to finally be living in the same city as her. I have always seen her on trips and family stuff, but never have I actually been in the same place with here for more than a week. So I am really looking forward to the friendship and bond that we will be making this next year. I am hoping that my year goes good and that I can keep up with all of my classes. I am planning on going to all of them, and trying not to miss them. I also really want to keep up with the reading and stuff, so I wont be as stressed out at exam time. I am looking forward to this next year, but I know it will be a hard adjustment and a huge challenge, but I know that if I work hard and put my mind into everything, I will do great. 
__label__label1 today was a pretty lousy start. last night matt and I talked about alchoholfor  about two hours. he needs lots of help. God is the only one who can really  change his life. its hard for him to let go and put his life in the hands of  another . samehere. can't tellif jamie is getting bothersome . I'm so tired , life  is like inthe evening. such a traitor ,momentsof light. haze followed by  enlightenment . God speaks, I listen, but still no work is done. How will I  ever get out of this slump? there seems to be no ethical -work movement in  possible future. so tired eyes heavy with disgust and empty anti-thought. supposed philosophy is taking the place of construct. Although there seems no  point inthe sadness or loneliness there can't come any change from me. there  seems no way to get out without talking to those id never talk to otherwise . why involve them now whenthey will neverrbe another part? they'll help. need  more pills. three movies since move. dobies sucked. not sixth sense. saw PROPNAME. drew too. she is the future. run PROPNAME run ? hopeless acquisition followed by  incision tommorrow a decision perfected by revision. incisino from God made all  the diffence. IHATE READING IHATE CALCULUS I hate astronomy. I hate myself  above all and I can't say that alltogether it is a bad thing . I hate verbosity. I hate hating . I yearn for peace but find no answer that has lasted . PROPNAME is  the answer but it is so hard to stay in his hands. I need a haircut . I need a rainfall. I need a phonecall. maybe I should buy a  new car. And I wish it was a big world because I'm lonely for the small town id  like to drive and not look back . blow my money at a casino in seattle if one  existed. then id sit in the rain all day and eat salami sandwiches . meat the  woman of my dreams at a dance who is almost as depresed as I think I am. she'd  see right through me and I through her. then Id move to mexico and start a church   then move back to texas and live on a ranch . then move back to austin an start  a rock and  roll band with major influences from Ro

__label__label0 I really can not wait until this weekend. LOCNAME is playing PROPNAME in football and I have some friends who play for PROPNAME. I have not seen these friends since this summer. I have only seen them on t. v. when they got killed my LOCNAME last week. I hope that they play better this week. I feel bad saying it, but I kind of hope PROPNAME wins. I know it sounds terrible, but they are my friens & one of the players is my ex-boyfriend, but we are still good friends. I am most excited about seeing him. I talk to him on the phone occasinaly, but I have not seen him in person since July. We lived about 00 minutes away from each other and that made it kind of hard to see each other - that is why we broke up. The way we met was pretty cool. Every year my home town (LOCNAME) has a BBQ Cook Off. Let me tell you it is so much fun - I look forward to it each year. My dad has had a team in the cook off ever since I can remember. Anyway, before the cook off last March a lot of my friends went over to my friends apartment. One of my friends who plays football for PROPNAME was coming down and he was bringing a lot of his friends with him. They all showed up at the apartment and we left for the cook off. My friends and I thought this one guy was so cute & he ended up driving my best friend and me to the cook off. I talked to him some that night, but then he and his friends all went back to LOCNAME. Months went by and I graduated high school and for my senior trip we went to LOCNAME. We had been there for a few days and one of my friends on the trip with me told me that he had just ran into "the cute guy from the cook off" down stairs. I couldn't believe it. He just happened to be in LOCNAME at the same time as me & he was staying in the same hotel. We all ended up meeting and going out together & we had so much fun. Ever since then we have talked and become really good friends. I guess that is why I am so excited about this weekend. 
__label__label1 I don't understand how the man with the questions can be the smarter of the two. The man with the answers has to be the smarter. All the man with the questions know's that he know's what he doesn't know and wants to. But the man with the answers know's. Whatever he want to know he knows because that's how the question goes. There's no way for the man with the questions to more than the man with all the answers. One, the answer guy's going to know the answer. And people are always going well does he know how to get the answer?? well of course he does. just ask him how he got that answer. and he'll answer that question. what I don't understand is how this teacher is going to believe and only think that she's right. the answer was completely easy to comprehend. I hate that teachers get so arrogant. just because they know more of the subject they think they're knowledge is invincible against all others. how can you teach others and let them learn if you're unwelling to learn yourself?? it's totally bull. makes no sense to me. always dreamed about being a super hero. guess it's somewhat ironic that my vietnamese name translates to mean hero. I don't know I guess I have some type of super-hero complex. always want to help others always want special powers. always wanted to win the girl. always a dream about this girl. never see a face and can never hear her talk. I can see her figure and I can see how graceful she is. she walks be side me in my dreams. always want to hold her hand but afriad that I'll wake up when I touch her. so I walk beside her and look at her. I know I'm going to meet this person. I  can sense it. Real into the "Crow" look the romantic dark super-hero adventure story. brings out the use of love. people always take love for granted and if not love the good fortune that they get to be with or have a relationship with others. wonder if I'm a hopeless romantic. i can see myself taking my date on a walk or just laying there with her and talking. I don't see the sex, not that I wouldn't,  or much else. the tai kwon do club at this university is not very well trained. the main instructor may be a good fighter but his form sucks. to me form is the most important part of martial arts. adds gracefulness and at the experienced level makes movements faster stronger and completely balanced. it all comes from form. the traingle is speed balance and strength and not of that comes from bad form. or at least none of those three will continously exel without balance. most people don't see it that way. they think that compromising form for quick speed and strength is better. but they don't look in the long run. just like in chess the game is all about the long run. and with mastering balance, speed and strength will always become faster and stronger. then there are those that are lazy and don't even care for form and try to show off their katas with feet not lined up and hands out of place. with such bad alignment energy will not flow correctly . people get so arrogant and greedy. makes me sick 
__label__label1 I am writing my first assignment for psychology 000. I am in my room right now. I like my room. I live in PROPNAME. I live on the 00rd floor. I hate waiting on the elevator. It takes too long. I don't feel like using punctuation or capitalization. I don't have to becasue you told us not to worry about it. I don't even have to worry about spelling either. I'm just typing away. my roommate just passed gas, broke wind, but I do not smell it. yet. My roommate is calling his parents. he left a message. he is going back to houston this weekend for a funeral service for one of his school friends. 0 people died from my school shortly after graduation. it is really sad. I knew one of them. I didnt like him too much because he was annoying, but now I feel bad. he would have left for the ORGNAME 0 weeks after that. anyways, my roommate is playing music from his computer, it is really loud, it is an old song, I have no clue what it is. now its playing snoop doggy dogg, it is really old. it is 00:00, I have been typing for 00 minutes now. my suite mates are studying, or attempting to study. we just finished watching ORGNAME music awards. it was really cool. I have never watched so much cable before since my family never ever had cable before. so I watch it all the time. my speaker is right in front of my face. I am trying to type without looking at tke keyboard. I am doing okay, but it is pretty hard. my girl friend os tired. her name is PROPNAME. shes looking at my computer screen. she is funny. and very pretty. my side of the room is pretty messy. I need to clean it up. I need to get some book shelves for my books and other items. it is almost friday, I can't wait. today is september 0, 0000. also known as, 0/0/00. people said that bad things are going happen today. but nothing has happened yet, except. one of my suite mates failed his calculus quiz. I just finished my math homework. I am pround of myself. yea! um. anyways. who is going to read this? professor PROPNAME? or patrick? oh crap! I forgot to go to SI today. crap crap! I went last week. a lot of people were there. people even sat outside in the hallway. are we going to get a bigger classroom? ethernet is nice. it goes really fast. but not fast enough for $00 a month. what a rip off! my parents already pay a lot for the dorm, and we still have to get over charged for a phone line and ethernet. its not even that fast either. okay, my time is up here. it was fun writing this. 
__label__label0 I am so excited about being down at LOCNAME but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at LOCNAME. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to ORGNAME- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at ORGNAME ORGNAME is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and then I am going to study some Spanish and try to start reading Psychology. I am really mad that I am going to miss the first exam but thankfully I will be able to make it up. I am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. I almost wish I was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when I give it up. I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten to do and see since I have been Miss Teen of LOCNAME and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. I would like to run for President of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. I would love to be President of Pi Phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. I haven't gotten involved in anything at ORGNAME yet and I am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. My neck hurts today and I think it is from carrying my backpack all around. I had to take a bunch of my books back to the Co-op the other day so I got to lug the around. NOT FUN! LOCNAME is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. My sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to ORGNAME, but I love it at LOCNAME. I just really feel at home in LOCNAME and I enjoy the diversity of all the people. It really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. Coming from LOCNAME, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. Well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. I guess I will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading. 
__label__label0 This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 0 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the "freshman 00" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have PROPNAME because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of PROPNAME this weekend 
__label__label1 Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is "special" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul. 
__label__label0 why am I so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in my life, I have no clue. Its probably becasue I'm a freshman or is it because I just don't know what I'm am doing in this school, it's too hard. I don't know how to work the computer system, I have tons of homework, and its all catching up to me at the same time, it's unreal. I'm so bogged down with work and I have so much stuff to do but I'm sitting here typing on my computer on something that I don't know will even get sent to you. My friends are talking to me while I'm trying to write this assignment, and I can't' make my mind focus on on certain thing at all, the music is too loud and I have people trying to talk to me over the internet. these blinking lights are pissing me off I wish these people would shut up and let me tend to my business at hand. I need to read, do my pre cal and I just don't have the time. I don't know how to do my physical science lab, and reading just takes too muck time. I have a date tonight,  I don't have time to take them out, but I have to or that wouldn't be nice, I'm going through rush and that takes up more time than anything. I can't' deal with this anymore. I'ts starting to drive me crazy , but hopefully soon I will get used to it. Its such a change from senior year to freshman year of college. you go from doing nothing basically to have to read every night and do all sorts of written assignment, it's impossible twenty minutes is up got to run 
__label__label0 I am wondering why I am doing this writing assignment and if I really have to because I am doing the research also. THe music that I am listening to right now is very loud. I wonder if I should go to class today. I am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that I didn't know about. The test coming up on the 00th worries me because I am not sure what it will be over or what to study. My forearm is already beginning to cramp up while I am typing. my leg itches. I like this song that is coming on now. My eyes are very tired. my head itches and I have to scratch it. I think I need to stretch my neck. I really need to start getting more sleep since I have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. There is something under my foot that is bothering me. I wonder how long I have been typing for. Only five minutes. Now I am feeling like this is going to take forever. It is kind of dark in the room that I am in. I'm thinking about pizza. now I am thinking about the girl who's room I am in. She is in the shower. I ate pizza with her for lunch. She is very beautiful. She sure has been in the shower for a long time. PROPNAME PROPNAME's songs all sound alike to me. I can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 00's or something. My mind has gone blank for a second. What time is it now. Only 0 minutes. How come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. If I was a girl I wouldn't get one. That would hurt and why go through that pain. I think the music is getting louder. Cell phones!  Everybody is getting those too. And they keep getting smaller. That reminds me of Lethal Weapon 0 when PROPNAME PROPNAME complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. I can't think of anything. I am wondering if I really have to do this. Time check. 00 minutes. It is hot. It smells like austin water. The water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. I need a chair in my room so when I watch tv I don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. My back is hurting right now. Basketball caused my back problems. I should be playing basketball right now. Everybody thinks I am obsessed with basketball because I talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. I want to be a basketball coach. I can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where I can't play or coach. I have to be a coach or I won't enjoy my job. This girl kim drops everything on her feet. I swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since I have been here. sHe just interupted my train of thought. I kind of like this stream of thought thing because I am realizing all the crazy stuff I think about in a given time. THis song satellite. i mean what the hell is he talking about. It doesn't make since. time check. one more minute till I get to hit the infamous submit button. This was kind of fun. my arm is kind of tired though. 
__label__label0 Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in PROPNAME, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  
__label__label1 I'm looking at a picture of my best friend who is now in LOCNAME adn I wonder what she is doing right now. I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing at school at this very moment and why is every second centered around me like a movie or something, I think we should be able to take a sneek peek into others lives right when we want to. I've wanted to know why life isn't that easy. Pictures are supposed to make you happy and remember happy times yet when I see them I just think about times that will never take place again because they are in the past. Sometimes I seriously resent the past. I need to do my laundry and I need to put a different CD on the player because this one is getting old. I got two card for PROPNAME and I need to get off my butt and get the stamps. My mind is just full of things I need to do but I figured I would get this one done first, before I forget to do it later. I'm still hungry and I'm not sure if it is out of boredom or what. I refuse to get the freshmen fifteen because I'm happy with my weight right now. I like to workout and I need to do it more now that I have the chance right now. I hope my mom is doing well at her job right now. I also hope I get to go home for labor day to see PROPNAME for the first time in two weeks. I miss him so much, but if I stay busy it won't be that hard and will go real quick. Twenty minutes sure is a long time and I don't know how long I have been on the computer, it seems like the internet and email are the only links to people outside of LOCNAME. I would call more but bills are so expensive. I need to make my bed before I turn into a complete slob. The chair at this desk is way uncomfortable right now and my legs hurt from walking. My feet are going to look so ugly after one semester here but oh well. I'm going to get stamps after finishing this, I can't wait until it gets cold. Hot weather makes me so tired all the time. 
__label__label1 I wonder what this assignment is about. the tv is on and some stupid commercial is going on I need to go get some dinner by 0:00. wow that's a nice car on tv, I need to earn some money so I can get a better car. that reminds me my car is still broken down at taco bell and I need to call them and tell them not to tow it or I need to get it towed to a shop like the pep boys across the street man cars suck when they're not running I really wish I had lots of cash so I could buy a more reliable newer one I should call that guy tomorrow about the job so I can earn more money my mind hit a blank spot where I can't really think about anything. then how am I typing if I'm not paying attention to anything? I must be paying attention to something because I'm typing or maye I'm just doing it unconsciously I'm thirsty I need to get something to drink but I can't leave my desk ther's some water right there I'm goin to grab it as soon as I finish this thought how long has it been? only 0 or 0 minutes I need to organize my thoughts and my bedroom, they're both messy that pizza on tv looks really good hey I have a coupon for a free pizza maybe I should order one I wonder if they will deliver a free pizza or they will probably make me pick it up how far is the nearest pizza hut I think only a few blocks away but I should save that for when I'm out of cash and really tired of dorm food I think I already am tired of it but I will be more tired of it in a few weeks my eyes are kind of itchy I guess it's probably allergies saturday night live is on tv it's pretty funny I wonder what it would be like to be in the saturday night live cast I bet there are all kind of hidden relationships and tensions between the characters that go on behind the scenes like with PROPNAME PROPNAME from the older cast how much time has passed I've got about 0 minutes left then I will stop and look at the second assignment and if it won't take too long then I'll do it before dinner but if not I probably wont get to it for a few days because of all of the things I have to do in the next few days let me figure out what I need to do. I need to get my books, call that guy, deal with my car, clean my room, e-mail my friend from high school, check to see if my camera has arrived if not I need to e-mail that guy and see what's taking so long what are they doing on tv that's strange what else do I need to do lets see. I need to go to my classes and go get some groceries, talk to my parents about the money I owe them damn I need to find a way to get lots of cash to repay my debts and buy some of the stuff I've wanted for so long I haven't actually bought anything I just wanted to buy in probably a year because of all the money I owe I should have worked more last summer but I guess its ok that I didn't because I was sick for most of it I'm so tired of getting sick it really makes me angry and tense about things ok what time is it okay I've been writing for about 00 minutes I guess that's enough now I'm going to stop this and finish up this assignment 
__label__label0 right now my mind says why the hell do I have to do this. I'm not up to doing this crap because I just woke up and I realized that I have to get this homework done before it is due in class. I have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl I love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and I don't appreciate that. anyway I have realized that I have been slacking off in my classes and I have to get started on doing all of my homework because if I don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and I am going to be here all alone. I think that at he is stupid for what he did and I hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to  drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose,  then I will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is  all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, I am also thinking about this girl named felicia that I met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that I have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. I don't think that she thinks much about me but I sure do  hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy I am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food  at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is  not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so I we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out. 
__label__label0 Well here I am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always, constantly hitting the backspace key. I just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books I have is signifigantly cheaper there and then I registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like I could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade at the going away dance only for eighth graders I won a bag of blowpops huge bag and I never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer I would find one and throw it away. My roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already I'm still just kind of trudging along. I'm really tired its time to go to bed I wonder if I should take advil because I had my wisdom teeth out on friday but I'm really tolerant to pain so I never even took the perscription pain medication- but I have no idea if anything is wrong because I just sort of ignore the pain. After I finish this I am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she doesn't know who of her friends will be here so he might stay in our dorm but I know that they won't do anything I'm probably going home because I live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it won't bother me he's a nice guy- I have only known jenny for 0 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too. We both grew up in the LOCNAME with parents from LOCNAME so we have similar backgrounds. I filled out that survey it was so strange and so long. The pre-test thing. I'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives I'm such an innocent and I don't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions. One of our suite mates rushed and she got into ORGNAME and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and I asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because it's the first day of school and she has an 0:00 class tommorow but oh well it's not might life or my concern. this room is so cold. and she seems so smart to she took all the ORGNAME classes and I think she was on drill team too. And she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok I don't need a guy to make me happy even though I would like a boyfriend- I've never had one before that is so strange but that's ok. I saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that's ok. There are a few of us from church here also PROPNAME who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my differentials on norton or something- my brother like ICQed me and told me to do it at least once a week I had no ide what he was talking about and I tried to do it. I can't believe I have so much to do already I have a lot of classes I thought it would kind of be like high school but I don't think so I saw a few people around campus that I know from church it was really weird thinking I knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 00 minutes early but that won't last long- especially those 0 o'clock classes oh I think I need to charge my cell phone I'm not sure oh well. well I think my twenty minutes is up and I'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so I guess I could read sociology until she is done but. well good night. 
__label__label1 Wow, I can't believe I'm finally here. I've waited so long to get to the point that I am in my life right now, and now that I'm finallly here I feel like I really am not. I return to that same question that I've always grappled with. What is my purpose??  If I was religious in any sense then I might be compelled to believe in the "obvious. "  But I am not and therefore I must pretend to be purposeful and hope that in the end my lufe will be fulfilling. What did I throw away with PROPNAME?  Or did I throw it away?  Only time will tell I guess. I will say that I have never known such unconditional love as that which I had from him. I crave excitement though. A restless mind, I suppose. And a restless heart. One day I will meet my match I feel. Someone who will mirror me in my restlessness. we will feel out the world together and find happiness in adventure and passion. False idealism perhaps - or perhaps not. I burn with anger for what happened to Amber. Anger for whoever violated her and anger in myself for not seeing it coming. Let me correct myself - anger for actually seeing it coming and not doing anything about it. I've seen this coming to her for a year at least. And I never said anything to her. I learn from others, but I suppose others don't always learn from me. Thank God she's ok. perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. Well, a new start and new people await here. I feel like the world has handed me a gift and now it is my responsibility to embellish upon it. It's all there on a silver platter for me to grapple with, and I DO intend to grapple. I'm putting in my two weeks notice on August 0st. Counting down the days. My job has become such a headache. The money is good, the hours suck, and now the people suck. Why does money mean so much to me?  I feel like a green-eyed monster and I'm only 00 years old. I'm already thinking about investing. Thinking about doing a little research and putting my money where my mouth is. I plan on being in the six digits by the time 00 rolls around. What do you see when you look into people's eyes?  Eyes are the windows to the soul. I can read so much into a person by looking at their eyes while they talk. So what am I doing with blue contacts?  What am I trying to hide?  What do I want to become?  I think I would trust my warm brown eyes over my glacier-blue contacts any day. All in the fun I guess. A mystery to others and maybe even to myself. Casper is so peaceful. I wish I were a dog sometimes. To be caressed and loved all day and to give unconditional love without material or superficial worries must be pure emotional ectasy. Not a care in the world. My bed is calling.   
__label__label0 It is really hot in here. I wish someone would turn the ac down. I hope I didn't miss anything in Calculus today, but I can get the notes from PROPNAME. I need to do so much stuff this week with little time to do it in. I need to email PROPNAME and reply to all of the emails I got yesterday. I need to hang up my pictures in my room, but don't have anything to hang them with. I still haven't cashed the check from mom, and I'm running low on money. College is sooooo expensive and there's always too much to do. I hardly have time to do everything that I need to do. I have to pay for all of the clubs I want to join and speaking of that, I have to write essays and fill out applications for TX sweethearts, spirits, the children's hospital, and go to a meeting for AED. I have a meeting at the ADPi house tonight and Wed night!!!!  All these meetings--at least one everyday/night. I also have so much chemistry homework tonight. I keep falling behind in all of my classes. As soon as I catch up in one of them, I fall behind in another. But last night I did a lot of homework, so that helped a little. You know, everytime I am trying to write a thought, twenty more come into my mind. I wonder who looks at these writings and if they get bored of hearing everyone's thoughts. I have to do seven minute abs tonight because my roommate and I are going to for two weeks to see if we can get a six pack. My fingers are starting to tingle from typing so much, so fast. I wonder what's for dinner tonight at the sorority house. I hope it's something healthy. I haven't been eating very healthy since I left home. Not that I ate healthy before but at least I had complete meals, not just pizza or junk food. what else am I thinking of?. maybe if I look around my room. i really need to clean my crap off the floor and desperately need to do laundry. I normally go home to do it but I do not have time to go all the way home and waste time there, waiting for it to dry like last time. although I did promise my brother that I'd bring him up to my dorm to check it out since he hasn't seen it yet. and I really want to see my dogs. I think I miss Bear more than anyone else. probably because I cannot talk to him over the phone or email him like I can my parents. russ calls me nonstop and really gets on my nerves. I feel bad when I'm mean to him but I have so much stuff to do and don't really have time to talk about nothing to him. uh, oh, my sweetmate just got home from yesterday. She stays at her boyfriend's house almost every night. PROPNAME told me that she came in at 0am this morning making tons of noise. she doesn't care about other people and is so self-centered. I hope she doesn't come in here and read this. that'd be very bad. I need to go to TOPS to get my pictures from last friday night. I had so much fun and want something to remember the night by. 
__label__label1 These past couple of weeks I have felt kind of out of place. Not that I haven't been having fun and meeting new people just that it is taking some time to adjust to everything. I sometimes think that I have too much going on and that I need to quit something. Between school, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and soroity I am always on the go, and I never have time to just sit and relax. However, when I get a little time to just relax, all my friends start to come in my room and ask me to go do something or just talk. I don't want to be rude about it, because I don't know all them well enough to know how they would react. For example, I've been feeling sick lately and I really should stay home and get some rest tonight, but all of my pledge sisters are going to a mixer tonight, and I feel that I should go with them. I don't really want to go, but I feel like I need to meet some more people and not let my pledge sisters down. I know that they understand, but I also feel that they might think that I don't like to go out and have a fun time with them. These thoughts have also led me to revaluate why I did ORGNAME ORGNAME. We have to practice so much a week that I have to miss some of my pledge meetings and give up time that I could use to study or rest. However, I love the girls on the squad and all of the fun that we've had together so far. Also, the games are such a rush and make me feel so privalleged to be out there on that field. I would feel like I was letting the whole team down if I quit something that I've been committed to a lot longer than my soroity. Plus my coach has been so understanding lately with the adjustments that I'm going through, that it would be hard for me to tell him that I might want to quit. I guess I just need to sit down and eveluate all of the options that I have right now, or maybe just give it another couple of weeks to get adjusted before I make a decision. 
__label__label1 Calaculus is thr one road block in my college education. It's not that I hate math, I would much rater deal with numbers than people but I'm pretty bad at both. I giot my roomates girl friend to help me with tonites HW. Turns out I got the all right but did them totally wrong. I guess this is stream of consciosness. Hey the new ORGNAME ORGNAME video is on! I loved soundgarden but Cornells neew stuff just dosent have that bite. I probably liked them beacause PROPNAME PROPNAME, Sound gardens drummer, was an early inspiration to my own drumming. I love to drum. I'm happyi live in an apartment so my roomates and I can just play. I cont think id be able to play in a dorm! I read a couple books that worked along the stream of consciousness angle, but I always think of a comic my friend wrote  when I hear. he draws an exellent japaneese style comics or books I should say, on VERY sexual themes, hey there cool pretty funny to. On his website one time he did a 00 page thing on his own emotional problems. he protraied his conciousness as litte lizards and naked chics inhis head. it was hellously intaspective. I CAN'T SPELL. Its been 00 Minutes. This isn't so bad. Not boraring topic to write on and this will probably never be read so blah blah blaeh. I like the fact that most of my profs. like the internet. this is great no worrying about turning thins in. I'm always on my computersince I am a true computer nerd. that is of course why this is so late!! Hey a sound garden video is on! hey my writing is  coming back in on itself! I've alredy gone through one cigarette. I don't some much usually just after a big meal and at parties. I hate the tobacco companises but that is a EXtreemly shallow argument since I've given them a bit of cash! I hate people who have that kind of mind set. I don't like myself to much so I guess it works out. well now I really hope no one reads this  00 minutes HA ah!! 
__label__label0 Right now I am feeling very annoyed. I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a ORGNAME gift form the Co Op I can't believe that PROPNAME is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 0 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the "jerk" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the ORGNAME ORGNAME and then found out that he was going to LOCNAME I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 0 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 00 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 0-0 times a week and running 0-0 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like PROPNAME PROPNAME. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   
__label__label1 Writing about what I am thinking will be a new experience for me. I just got back from psychology class, so naturally I am thinking about psychology. The way I learn is that I review everything said in class in my mind for at least 00 minutes after class. Now that I am doing the writing assignment I have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. I honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. PROPNAME, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. Trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. I listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. It makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. I cannot study at home because I have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  I also cannot study at libraries because I am a people watcher. I like to just sit and watch people. I learn a lot about people that I don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. I also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when I get a really bad one. I think I have almost overcome them, but I do have one right now. all I have to say about it is AGHHHHHHHH. My mind almost automatically switches to thinking about PROPNAME when I have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and I love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and I just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. I think the only reason that I went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. I guess I didn't have very much self esteme when I met him, but now I do, and now I realize how bad he was for me. Alright, it think that my 00 minutes are almost up, so I am going to go eat something and get ready for water polo practice. adios. 
__label__label1 I figured that I would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but I now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. I think about all that I have to do, assignments in school mostly, but I am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. I suppose I'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. Then there's that person I mentioned. I am confused about a certain guy that I really like. Sounds so tyipical, right? I will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. I am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that I have met at ORGNAME t. They are so interested in having a good time, all the time. Drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. I ate lunch with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. I don't drink, because of the law (I'm 00), and I don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the Bible says. Life seems so messed up. I'm not depressed about it, but I am bothered by what I see in the world. I feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and I know where it is coming from. It started with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. God has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless God sends revival, things will continue to get worse. Also, I have been reading about the PROPNAME administration in a book entitled Unlimited Acess, and I think, "If this is what our president is getting away with who CAN we trust?!" Of course, I don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. God is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of His people. Some day, all of this--including the computer that I'm typing on---will burn up. God will come back to gather His elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. God's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. He doesn't have to save anyone. We all deserve damnation because of our sin. We sinned in PROPNAME. But in God's incredible mercy and love he sent PROPNAME as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, that I might be found among those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. I struggle with the same problems that everyone does. But I keep coming back to the cross and pleading the blood of PROPNAME. I have no inate merit. My righteousness are as filthy rags. It is insane to think that one can somehow work their way into heaven. The Bible says "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy He has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. " PROPNAME is our only way to the Father. Not our pitiful attempts to earn our salvation. PROPNAME said, "I am the Way the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me. " You have to come to God (it is clearly taught in the Bible), but you can't unless God makes you come(also a clear teaching. "No man comes to Me except the Father drag him. ") That leaves you in a particularly strange situation. You have to come, but you can't. I pray about that one a lot. Well, those really are the things I think about. I'm a Christian, and I live in constant awareness of my Creator. 
__label__label0 I am really tired today. I am also pretty homesick. It is my birthday. I wish that I was at home. I want to celebrate my birthday with my parents and sister. I want to go to my favorite restaurants. Blue Goose sounds really good, but why am I worried about good restaurants in LOCNAME. I can get just as good or better food here in LOCNAME. I want a turkey sub for dinner tonight. I also want to go to get ice cream from PROPNAME's with my friends, but I have so much to do. I have to review all of my notes tonight for my classes, plus I have to go to the sorority pledge class meeting at sometime. I better look up the time soon. I am glad I stayed in and studied this weekend. It helped me get organized and feel like I knew what I was doing. Rush really made me crazy. I hope I like being in a sorority. I am scared because I don't party that much, and I don't want it to take away too much time from my studies. I know that I do have to balance my life. I have to make time to meet people nad have fun. I just never feel like I have enough time to do everything. I feel bad that I couldn't go to lunch with PROPNAME today because I had to read my phylosophy, but I went to run and then to church this morning and I had to get my stuff done this afternoon to be ready for the meeting tonight. I wish that I was at home and could just relax and watch TV. I miss summer time when I didn't have to do too much. I hope all of my friends in all of their colleges are doing well. The birthday card from PROPNAME made me sad. It already feels like we are drifting apart from each other. Even when I e-mail her, I don't know what to say. I feel like she doesn't care what is going on here because she doesn't know all of people I am talking about when I tell her what I am doing. Why doesn't she tell me a lot about her life?  I want to know what is going on, not just hi how's it going kind of stuff. I am so happy I know my roommate though. We have had so much fun together, and we keep each other sane. I get scared when I think what might have been if I had gone pot luck. I keep meeting people who have crazy roommates, but I think I really could have gotten a long with everyone. I have met the coolest people. That girl I sat next to in Economics the other day, was really neat. I need to get her number. I like my sailor sis in Delta Gamma, but I am afraid to go out with her. I don't know if I can keep up with all of these UT people. They party way more than I do. I think I am going to go home this Labor day weekend because the parties aren't a necessity to meet people. Anyways, nobody who I talk to will remember me because they are all drunk. I don't understand why I go to these paries to  meet people when I can't even have a coherent conversation with people, but I guess they are fun. I am so confused right now, but I think it will all start working out soon. I just wish that I knew everybody instantly and did not have to work so hard at meeting people. In high school I could see anyone and know them. Like at the game last night, I hardly knew anyone, and in high school I could talk to anyone around me. I guess soon enough, I will make new and good friends, but I sure hope it comes soon. Luckily, I have PROPNAME. She has kept me from being sad, plus I really like it in LOCNAME. I love walking around campus and seeing everyone. It is the prettiest campus, and I really like all of my classes. I am really scared about keeping my grade point up. I worked hard in high school and did well, but will it be enough for college?  I sure hope so. I know my parents will be happy as long as I do my best, but sometimes I feel that is not enough. I guess I pressure myself too hard. I just have to keep listening to my parents advice to balance my time between relaxing, socializing, and studying. I will do my best. I know that it will all start being normal to me pretty soon. I just have to wait for the adjusting period to be over. 
__label__label1 Right now I am feeling very tired. I have a nervous feeling in my stomach probably because I am going to meet a guy that I've had a crush on this friday. I am kind of upset that my friend from chicago hasn't called me. I am also nervous about the semester, because I am hoping to bring up my ORGNAME since I didn't do so well, last year. My second year and already I feel like my classes  are just going to give me a lot of trouble. I'm still on basics and at times I feel dumb because I should already be in my upper division courses. I am motivated again to do well and I feel that everything I am doing so far is going to get me to where I want to be. I have exercised, studied, relaxed, etc. What else do I need to achieve my goal. I want to get into med-school and become a doctor. But, I also want to finish as soon as possible. I miss my family, but I don't miss the rules that they give me. My parents are good parents, don't get me wrong, but I still disagree with a lot of the rules. I guess everyone raises their kids differently. But in a way they have me scared. Scared, to go out to clubs with my friends, or parties or any other social activity that happens at night. Mainly because they would always tell me that it wasn't me they didn't trust it  was the "people out there"  So, that freaks me out and whenever I do go to clubs or anything I'm always paranoid that someone is going to have a gun and just start shooting. Or an even worse thought is that I might somehow get hit by a drunk driver. Whatever happens in the world that makes the news and freaks out my parents is what I'm afraid of. Maybe, that's how they wanted it. I'm still a pleasant person to hang out with, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just worry too much. Back to the feeling tired bit, well this past weekend I went home for my sisters birthday. It was a surprise. She gave me a big hug. And it made me feel really good, because me and my sister are always fighting. And going away to college has brought us closer. She is 00 and I'm 00 so it's a big age difference. Anyway I went to her party that my parents had for her and I slept about 0 hrs. the entire weekend. I got home Monday morning and slept all day. And about being nervous well, sometimes I always have that feeling. And usually I can explain it, but there are times when I don't know why. I like this guy PROPNAME from LOCNAME, the one who hasn't  called. And since I've met him, I can't seem to stop talking about him. I catch myself talking about him as though he's made a big impact on my life. And really he hasn't. So far everyone I've met has heard about him and my roommates are tired of it. But I can't help it, so lately for everyone's sake I've been keeping quiet and trying to talk about other things, but I still have him on my mind. 
__label__label0 For the past few days and now I have been thinking a lot about my friends back hone. I am thinking of all the good times we had and how I miss them a lot. And of course I am thinking about girls and especially one of them. I also thinking aout this summer and how I met a lot of different kinds of people by attending the preview program and gettting an early start on college. Adjusting from hihg school took college took a little bit of time. Having fun and partying are always on  my mind. I partied a lot this summer. it was a lot easier then because I only had to worry about two classes; one of them was pre-cal and I knew I could hadle that so it was basically only e000. Some other thoughts that also come to my mind at this moment are thoughts about my parents and how I miss them and my rest of my family back home. Thinking about that sometimes makes me sad but I don't let it get to me. I am usually a very happy person and people can tell when something is bothering me or not. lately I have not gone out mainly because no one has really invited me go out with them. But also because I have been a little low on money. There is money in the bank but I don't know for how long there will be money there. This summer I spent a lot more monwy than I should have spent. I don't usually worry about money but I really spent a lot and the worst part of it is that I don't know waht I spent it on. at this instant I am thinkign about my grades I got this summer. I was disappointed with them because I know I could of done better. I got a B in English in which I  am pretty satisfied because I can't write good at all. But I know I should of gotten an A in PRE Cal. I put a lot of effort and I thought I deserved an A but the teacher ws sort of a Bi---- towards the end. I was really frustrated with this. I had never been so caught on grades until this occurred. So instead of starting my college career with a 0. 0 I started with a f******* 0. 0. this really frieken sucks big time. 
__label__label0 Well what do I want to say I guess I should start by being pissed off that the girl I'm dating didn't call me last night after she said she would. we aren't committed or anything it just aggravates me when someone goes back on their word. well my brother's in town for the first time to see me we went to a good party last night, actually it was totally lame and it sucked that it was his first u. t. party. tonight will be so much better though cause the party tonight will be cool. phi Kappa Psi is where it's at. right now notre dame is barely beating purdue even though it's a two point game n. d. should run away. college has been cool so far and I like the fact that I automatically get credit for this assignment by just writing my thought down. that's pretty cool. my hardest class is my calculus class it's totally reeming me. i've never had a tutor before but he's my new best friend now. damn it's hot in here. the cafeteria should open right about now. i hope they have good food today lately they've be lacking the good food department. my roomate just doesn't understand. I really do believe he and I are do a good fist fight before it's all over. actually it won't be a good fight because I'll kill him. he's so loud and thinks that just because we're roommates we're automatically buddies for life. i think we could be friends maybe even good friends if he could. we'll how I don't know cause he gets on my nerves so much. oh well we're two different people from two different background. kid rock is awesome. especially on the mtv video awards. it's really hard to writes and sing at the same time. but I guess I can do that considering the fact that there aren't any wrong answers and I can write anything. i don't really miss home that much. maybe my family a little but austin is so cool. i just hope I can keep my grades up so I can stay in the fraternity. and I hope I have enough money to pay for all the dues. well my  time is almost up and I hungry as can be so I guess I'll go now. ? 
__label__label1 I hate this type of assignment, the kind of work that tries to force a thought into one's head. Thoughts should come naturally, and when the mind is prompted, then nothing comes to it. Well, as long as I'm supposed to be thinking, let's think about why I'm doing this. It's to get a good grade. Why do I do anything. I always seem to respond in a manner in which the answer seems acceptable to everyone else. Maybe I'm doing this to please everyone else: my instructor, my parents, myself. So why do I do everything else that I do?  Why do I devote so much time to working out and exercise?  Is it because I want to fool myself into living longer?  Is it to mold my body in such a way as to attract others and get their attentions. I always say that I just don't want to become weak, that when I find someone to protect, I want to be able to protect them. But if I am always desparately trying to find this person that would fill the current void in my life, why is it I push everyone away?  My friends, my peers, my elders?  I don't do what everyone says is "fun. "  I don't hang around others for long, I don't go to parties, and I rarely impart what I truly feel. It seems as if I've been hiding half my life, hiding from others and from myself. Inside, I scream to myself, "go out have fun meet new people you boring dolt!"  and in my mind I'm always prepared to do so, but when the moment of truth comes about, I never act out my true intentions, either being intimidated or discouraged. I remember when I went to that UT freshman orientation. My friend said when you get to the dance, just go up to people, introduce yourself, and ask for a dance. And he's a loser. But it worked for him, so I tried it myself. The first time, rejected. The second time, rejected. The third time, rejected, and even I know that 0 strikes is out. I get so sick of hearing excuses like oh I'm too tired or I don't feel like it. Yeah right. Then why the hell are you here at the dance?  Just give me a straight and vehement no and I'll be on my way, not even to think twice about the encounter. Now on strike three, I had another reason for retiring that night. That girl, the way she looked, the way she acted, it was deja vu. I went to another country with a girl like that, stood by her side, opened my heart to her, and offered it to her. She led me on, to believe that for once, I had an opportunity for love, that it was my time in the spotlight, and with the most beautiful girl I have ever been with. Visually stunning, patient but forceful, and gentle, someone to listen. I thought I finally found her, and felt as though I was riding above clouds. Then I just came down hard with the rain. I've never been the same afterwards, because everything was seen in a different light. This third girl at the dance, the rudeness didn't get to me, but the memories of heartbreak was just too much to handle. I asked PROPNAME out to the dance once, and she came. But we never danced. I asked and she ignored. Just like This time. Love. I'm too young to know its true meanings, and too inexperienced to have any justification in even corrolating it with the words I or me. I'm always looking for "love" for companionship without even really knowing what to look for. It can't just be the person that gives you that indescribable burning feeling within. Too many times has that happened. I say to myself, you know what love is. You loved PROPNAME, because all you ever did was argue, yet you could stand it. She broke your heart, lied to you, worked behind your back, carried you up and dropped you, and yet you still thought of her. Hell, you still think of her. You've been talking to her as a friend and the feeling has never left you. Isn't that enough to be love?  It's as close as I've gotten, I'm sure, but what about prom. To have danced with someone I've never known before, to talk, and to, after so long, have fun. When I held her in my arms, and her hair brushed my face as the slow songs played through, what was that feeling. Was it a feeling of completeness, of safety that as long as with her that nothing can go wrong?  What was that?  I go through sleepless nights thinking of PROPNAME sometimes, someone who I never gave a second thought to until that moment I told her goodbye. The moment in which the swelling in my throat caught even me by surprise. But am I looking for love or just someone. I don't want to end up like my uncle, having married a woman only because she threatened to commit suicide. Is he happy?  Am I happy now?  no, I'm not. 
__label__label1 I am sitting thinking about how I have a headache, and how I am not hungry but I have a desire to eat because it is lunchtime. I am keeping an eye out for the evil ants that rule our dorm room. I think my roomate is sexy. I am havig a hard  time relaxing and just writing I stop and pause to think of what I am thinking. my long nails make it hard to type my hair is falling out in droves. tompetty is in a week and a half I love tom petty. vh0 is on and is starting to get annoying I am going to turn it off, that's better.

I only have to write for ten more minutes. nothing to say or write but I must john mellencamp is talented I think I will listen to enrique -- hold on I just sneezed all over my screen I wiped it off with a dry erase eraser I am listening to echo instead I got a room at the top of the world tonight I got a room at the top of the world tonite & I ain't coming down & I ain't coming down I got some one who loves me tonite maybe not I don't have a significant other I think I need to changhe the soong but I am afraid I am starting to bve depressed again sometimes I think miriam lies but I guess not I saw her bruises but I think she might lie about other things.

__label__label1 I am thinking right now, at this momest what PROPNAME is thinking. does he like me??  I wonder. I wonder if I am too short. I wonder if I am too fat. I wonder if my mom is Ok. she is always worrying about me and she thinks so highly of me. I don't want to let her down. My dad works so hard for the entire family. I sometimes think he looks so sad. I hope he isn't sad because o love him more than anything. I wonder if I will find true love?  Someone just like my father. A strong, hardwroking, Loving man who would do anything for his wife and kids. I am very annoyed right now at the sound of the vaccum. I feel sorry for the woman who is vaccuming. I hope she can not read this as she is standing behind me. I am very excited about the party tonight. I hope I can balance work play. I think I will be able to. I have never had a problem before. All the girls here are very nice. I was really scared to come here because I thought all girls that went here were snobs. But they are nice. I have matured greatly since I have been here. I can't believe I have a cclass at 0:00. That is such a nightmare. I would rather just get them all over with at once. I hope I picked the right sorority. I am glad I am not in Kappa with PROPNAME. but then I wonder if I should be a Kappa. I think I just look more like a kappa then a theta. Oh well. I will be happy. Our pledge class is awesome. I am so excited about this scrapbbok we have to  make. It is so fun. I love being like a martha stewart. Is it bad that I just want to go to school to find a husband and j\have my 0 kids????  I hope I really don't have to work. It scares me. Everything was perfect before I left. now everything scares me because I am facing reality. I am living with a person I don't even know - to go to school here. I hope the future brings awesome things for me. I am worried because everyone says that there is a time in your life that will be grief. I have had the best life so far. I am scared that one day it will just hit m - poof - and I will just want to die. I hope my mom or my dad or my brothers don't die soon. I love them too much. I never show them that I do though. I probably have the worst relationship with my motehr, ever. we barely speak. I just go to her if I want money. I think that that is because she sees me as the most perfect creation, ever. so she never has yelled at me, or scolded me. but she yells at my brothers all the time. That is so unfair to them. I should not be treated better. My brothers are all dyslexic, including me, but that is not my e\excuse. It is my brothers excuse for everthing. My mom is always doing PROPNAME's papers or assignments for him. That is so wrong. I work hard and study more because I am dyslexic. I deal with it. My brothers see it as a means to get out of doing work. The assume they are dumb, so they don't even try. they are satisfied with being dumb. That should not be the case. I really miss PROPNAME. she is my very best friend. I also miss PROPNAME. my two best friends at tech. I think it is great how I did not follow them. I am a very dependent person, yet independent. I depend on my friends, yet I love to be alone to ponder and be by myself. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are like my securities. Evn if I did notr have one friend here, I knew they, at leats bridget, will alwyas be there for me. I hope tonigth is fun. I feel really sorry for my suitemate. She tries so hard to meet boys but they just don't like her. She has had sex a lot. I am very pround of my virginity. I think it says a lot abput who I am and how important God and my morals are. I love the fact that I can just talk to God anytime - anywhere by myself. He knows all about me - and I know all about Him yet I have never seen him nor spoken to him. A true person is found in the dark. If you were to turn off all the lights everyone would probably like a totally different person they who they think they should like. It wouldn't matter is you were tall, small, fat, ugly, black or white, if the light were off. Only the insides of people would matter. Appearances say a lot aboiut people, but yet they don't. If a person was ugly, you probably wouldn't really care what they thought. Because we are all attrcated to people. Our frieds are people we think are attractive and so we only like people in which we think there is something pretty about them. well, my twenty minutes are up so I guess I have nothing more to say. 
__label__label0 I am feeling very confused at this point in my life. I am thinking about my future and my career. I am also very nervous about my classes and how much effort each class will require of me. I miss having the reassurance of my friends and family. People say that things get better but at this point I don't see that happening. I am glad that I came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then I would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. Now that I am here I am sure that I was better off at a smaller school. But I think I will really enjoy what I learn about other people while I am here. At the present moment I am having to learn time management. I have load of work to do in each class and I feel that if I am not doing my work continuously that I will fail. On top of that, I feel that although I am spending most all my time doing work I am still not understanding everything. I guess I wonder why people want to give us so much work. Now I just heard that on girl that I went to school with just died. What is going on with this world. I feel that more and more people are just dying. How are we suppose to concentrate on work when all this other stuff is going on. Now I am talking to a friend and she just told me about what happened. Anyway, I have lots of work to do and I have or I feel that I have no time to do my work. I wish I was back home resting instead of here having to work my hardest. Anyway, I hope that this year will get better for me so that way I won't be as unhappy. So I guess I should have a positive outlook on life. Wouldn't it be nice if everything went the way people wanted it too. No complications what so ever! I hope that God, family and friend will get me through all my tough times. I should me thankful for what I have because some people are not as fortunate. 
__label__label1 MMMMM I wonder what's for dinner tonight??? I have so much crap to do before I leave to go home. Why is this print so small? Oh well, I have no idea what to get PROPNAME for her birthday. Man I'm really having a hard time typing today. I wonder who's on im. I hope PROPNAME is I can't wait to see him on Saturday, and I really can't wait for the Mexican food. I need to spend time with my mom and dad and go shopping so I have clothes to wear down here. I don't want to go on that retreat. This sucks. Okay well I have another 00 minutes and my head is so jumbled up. I bet they think I'm a moron. My back hurts and I really need a nap. I don't want to write my English paper! I need to find a job here so I can have some spending money. I can't believe my math book cast me $00 that really put a damper on the day. I can't type for the life of me today. I wonder why they put a sticker of a bee on this computer. That's so random. I want to check my hotmail I wonder if anyone exciting wrote me. I haven't heard from my mom I wonder if everything's okay. I really need a nap. This whole go out every night and wake up at 0 thing is killing me. Oh crap I have to do my math homework. I wonder if it will matter if I go tomorrow. I'm going to be so exhausted. I should go grocery shopping so I can have some snack to munch on. The food here really isn't that bad. I should work out again today because I only worked out for 00 minutes and ate a huge lunch, I can't gain that freshman 00. I hope someone calls me I'm bored. That's neat that this computer capitalizes your Is for you. Only 00 more minutes. I hope Cat can get her cd burner working I really want that song it was so sweet. Man am I glad we don't have mandatory study hours, talk about adding to my stress. My eyes keep closing. I wonder if I'll see PROPNAME tonight. I'm stressing out about TX OU weekend. I want to be able to see my family and PROPNAME. I can't believe its $000 to make a cooler what do they think this is homecoming? I'm glad my face cleared up last time I go get my eyebrows waxed. I wish I were going home tomorrow. I don't want to go on this retreat. I wonder when we're getting our tshirts in, hopefully soon. Man my wrists hurt. I really need to get one of those pad things. I wonder how I'm supposed to paste this into that other site??? Yes, only two more minutes left. Wow that went by pretty fast. I can't believe how bad I'm typing today. I wonder when I can get my student ID back. I hope we actually get tickets. TIMES UP! 
__label__label1 I'm so excited that my computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing today. Its really cool that I can watch movies through this sucker. Are you just supposed to write about whatever? This is pretty cool. I wanted to roller blade and some piece of crap girl told me I couldn't because some cop told her she'd get a $00 ticket, and plus it was raining, so that sucks. I am so ready to go out. I'm getting tired of sitting in my room all the time. I wonder what PROPNAME thinks about me. Does he still want to get back together with his exgirlfriend that sucks. If he does then he's stupid because I'm probably way cooler than her, and she's only a junior in high school. That's ridiculous. Boy's are so stupid sometimes. I can't believe the things they do. I want to play hockey. I miss playing hockey with my neighbors. Maybe I'll find somewhere to roller blade, and I'll be able to play hockey. That'd be good. PROPNAME wanted me to teach her how to play anyway so that would work out well since she's an RA. She'd probably know of a place around here that is good to skate on. Man, I wish my hair would grow out. It looks so dumb since its too short to get into a good pony tail and I don't feel like fixing it most of the time. I want to get purple streaks put in it. That would be pretty interesting. What if I got my eyebrow or my lip pierced? I bet that'd be weird. Just to look at yourself in the mirror with that would be different, plus my mom wouldn't freak out or anything. I hope radio shack gets that 0foot cord in soon, so I can get this TV thing working better and get some of these stupid cords out of my way. I'm glad PROPNAME traded cable connectors with me, so I could move the TV across the room. He wasn't using the length of it anyway. I really wish my mom hadn't sold my ORGNAME, Mario 0 sure would be fun right about now. I wish I was funnier. I can't ever say anything funny. I only laugh at other people or at myself when I do something stupid or klutzy. That was so funny when PROPNAME ran into that pole. I still can't get over that. He's a weird guy, but he sure is cute. At least PROPNAME is finally being half nice to me. That's different. I still can't believe he sat by me in sociology today. That's so weird. PROPNAME is my friend and he never sits by me. Butt hole. I need to read for that class. I'm glad I only have one 0 o'clock class on Fridays, so I can sleep late. I hate getting up early. It sucks bad. Ultimate Frisbee would be so fun on Saturday. PROPNAME is lucky to get to be in rowing. I want to join something. I halfway miss track, but not quite. It really sucks with Coach PROPNAME yelling at you all the time. I don't know what the crap this thing is. Stupid cat. ORGNAME ORGNAME always tries to rip you off. That was weird when I got in that fight with the lady at the hotel in LOCNAME. She was so bitchy. I can't believe she thought we would steal the nasty bedspread from their skanky hotel. I want PROPNAME and PROPNAME to come visit me. I miss them. Dorks still in high school. Oh, well. I hope PROPNAME is liking cheerleading more than she did her freshman year. I don't want her to go to LOCNAME next year. She needs to come her. That would be cool, but then I wouldn't be able to have any fun because I'd be afraid that she would get mad at me. I know I shouldn't care what PROPNAME thinks since we only met like three weeks ago, but that boy is driving me crazy. He's so hard to read. I need to get in touch with PROPNAME and see what is up with her new baby brother or sister and find out what PROPNAME's address in LOCNAME is. For someone who liked me so much, he should have told me when he was leaving or something. What a spaz monkey! I wish I could get in touch with PROPNAME. Eww. I need to call PROPNAME. He's a weirdo. I need to see what concerts are coming up. He always knows all that crazy crap. That guy matt is pretty cool. I should email him or something. I need to go visit PROPNAME. He's in a fraternity. Frats are so weird. They only seem to talk about their brothers and crap. PROPNAME is getting on my nerves somewhat. I know I shouldn't let the little stuff bother me, but when I'm with her all the time, its insane. Why can't she breathe with her mouth shut when she's sleeping. She needs to blow her nose or something. Anyway. This is a good song. I want to hear that Incubus song. That's awesome. 
__label__label0 Today I thought mostly about school and how hard it might actually be compared to what I thought it would be. Precalculus seems to be getting harder and I think although I don't know that I will do fine. I absolutely love my intro to family relations class because it has to do with so much of what I love that is families and children. Children are my passion my goal is to help children and maybe someday have a few of my own. Families are important also I love mine and to me that is one of the most important things anyone can treasure. Everyone should have a family whether it be just a grandmother or even a dog. My family was very unstable for awhile but not one point in my life would I trade my somewhat dysfunctional family for one that may or may not be slightly more perfect. I do realize however that not every family is as nice as others I feel for the abused children spouses and animals in the world but I also feel that if you do come from a family like that there is always someone out there that was meant to help or become a new pseudo family for you. That is what is so cool about the world no matter how many weirdos there are out there, there are an equal amount of nice people ready to help those in need. to me this may seem way cheesy but its true. well I also wonder about my other classes such as history that class I had today and although it is very interesting I think that I got myself into much deeper water than I thought. That's funny how we use phrases like "deep water" to describe events in our lives. Think about those that spend years trying to learn the English language and finally come to LOCNAME to use it and we use all these nonsense phrases to replace easier words that would make just as much sense. How difficult for those that must take even more years to learn those stupid phrases we use so often. I can't imagine learning a language and traveling over to the land all excited and getting there to learn that the language you really need to know will take another year to learn. I am not completely sure that that is a high concern for our world but I am sure the computer industries are perplexed by this everyday. My mom works with computer engineers and she tells me that all the Americans say jokes and the ones that are from across the ocean are secluded just because of our ridiculous humor (which I happen to love. It also amazes me how random my mind works just by writing for twenty minutes. maybe that's the point of this assignment or maybe I am the only one that seems to be so random and thinks about a million different things at one time. I thought it was interesting that we were joking about how bad it would be for someone to make a cry for help about suicide in this writing assignment and that that really would be stupid because the odds of you reading one out of what 000 or so people in the class is pretty slim and well I guess that is all I was thinking about that. My dog is really cute and I don't exactly know what I would do without him. Any time I go home to visit I find one of the hardest things to leave is my dog. I find it so fascinating that in a world of chaos and poverty and violence that almost and I do mean almost everyone could have an extreme attachment to some animal if they were given the opportunity. I also find it ironic and yet understandable that so many homeless people that do not have money or food have dogs yet they cannot support themselves and then I think about if I was poor and all alone that I would do what I could to have a dog to keep me company. This world is so complex I don't know why I try to understand it. My brother had his fifteenth birthday yesterday and was talking to girls and is going to drive soon all at the same time. It seems that all of a sudden the boy that I beat up on numerous occasions is starting to fight back and actually coming close and I mean close to beating me up. I always new the day would come because he is getting bigger but it all seems to happen as soon as I leave to house funny huh? My older brother on the other hand grew up in 0 seconds and was out of the house before you could say bye. 
__label__label1 Life as a college student is not quite like how I had expected. When I was a senior in high school, I thought I was going to be a studious student having a lot fun. But two weeks into college and I'm already slacking off. Most freshman who start off college don't really know what's going on, but I guess you can say that I had an early start. This was because my older sister, PROPNAME, also attends UT. With this factor, I quickly started to hang out with my sisters friends and began slacking off. So what I am saying is that, if I didn't have someone that knew what was up, than I would probably be having an easier time staying on track. Maybe its just me, but that is how I feel. But I am having a lot of fun, I guess you can say. I met a few people from orientation. They are the people that I am usually with. But I am having a hard time making friends in my classes. It might be because I'm always late to class and I never get a chance to settle down before class starts, probably. Well, I'm hoping to make some really good friends here. Isn't there a saying that a person makes most of their "life long" friends in college? I don't know. I don't even know why I am talking about my personal life for a homework assignment. I don't know if I am even doing it correctly. I guess that I will find out when I get my grade for it. Its been fourteen minutes and I am already running out of things to say. Okay, I'm going to return to what I was talking about in the beginning, SCHOOL life. I really feel that I need to get myself prioritized. I need to catch up with all my work and get ready for my up coming tests. I really don't know what else to write and I think this is about 00 minutes, so that it. 
__label__label1 Well, I don't know where to begin. I guess it started when she came over for lunch. I never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. She swooped in and plopped herself on my new Pappason chair. She was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. As she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the Hit or Miss store I noticed it. How her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. I mean, don't get me wrong PROPNAME is the best friend I have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. As she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. It was barely noticeable that my over grown Lab  PROPNAME had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. Then the words just fell out of her mouth. "He's come to rescue me, and I'm going to go. " I have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. I was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. My best friend was on her way to her life long dream. All I could do was cry and hug her. Then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. There was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and CELEBRATE! Wow. She's gone. What is left of me? I sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. I mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. I don't know how long. It seems like a whole season passed. Then one day, I got tired of crying. I knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and I'd be darned if I was going to let it rot inside of me. So, I did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. I joined a club. I went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. But you know what, I didn't find it. So, I began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. I left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. But, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to meet myself a man. I will find out what love is all about, and I mean real love. So, take that! Thus, my Man PROPNAME began. I browsed the Video Dating services, the internet (big mistake, HUGE), I scoped men at the grocery store, I bought some roller blades and tried out Hike and Bike trails, but nope, nothing'. Oh, I met men all right, but the kind of guys I met made me want to swear off of them forever. Yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. He's out there, my PROPNAME is going to come rescue me, I just have to have faith in real love. After some serious time had passed, I stepped out of my life and looked at what I had, and noticed that my Many PROPNAME had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. So I just plum gave up. I was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. And that was it. So, I dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then I began to pray. It helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when I shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? My heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. How in the world can the words I choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the Lord? He is the absolute perfect gentleman. I began to talk with Him every day. I began to listen for His voice and I began to find Him everywhere I went. I realized, I was never alone. I was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. The lord God in Heaven loves me, and I love Him. And you know what else, after I gave my heart to PROPNAME, I met PROPNAME. Would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 0 Great Danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as Dixie bolted out my front door. We met, just that simply. He has arrived at my front door now, so I better go. We are on our way to LOCNAME oh how I love to be rescued! 
__label__label1 I guess I have no started my 00 minutes of writing for the psychology class. As I'm writing I keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when I'm supposed to finish typing. I think about what I was thinking in class when you talked to us about this HW and how I wanted to talk about certain things while I was doing. But actually I start thinking about what happened tonight. We all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. I wish my roommate would listen to better music. After capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. We put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. Afterwards our President asked us to make this a dry event. I support him 000% because one I don't drink, two I don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three I think that all the points that he made were very strong. My roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. I think that they are wrong anyhow because as President I think that PROPNAME did the right thing in telling us not to drink and I don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. It was an executive decision. I'm debating whether I should go outside to the pool with everyone else when I'm done with that. I was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but I will see her on Monday so I'm still happy. This weekend I have lots of things to do. I'm running through my schedule for the weekend. Tomorrow I have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. I keep on thinking about what else I'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. I have never really sat down and typed everything I'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that I type just like I think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. My leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. But after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. We'll see if we actually will keep it but I think we will. I'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. I think about everything else I could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing I really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. I am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though I would still have liked to see my friend tonight. I kind of like this girl but I'm not sure. She's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where I can say that I like her but I do think that she's kind of interested. I also think about my friend who is coming up from LOCNAME next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. We have been friends for a long time and we get along great. But the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so I'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. I know that it can't be too much because I have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time I don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. If anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. We will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. I have the full intention of not having sex. I never have and never will until the day I get married. I have thought about being a priest for a long time so I'm just waiting for God to give me my call and I will follow His will. I really hope that he hurries up though cause I don't have a lot of patience. I think that I have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. I can be patient for certain things but I just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. I know that God doesn't count in that but I try to hurry Him up. One of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make God laugh all you had to do was to tell Him your plans. I'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. I guess that it all depends on whether you are Christian or Catholic or simply don't believe in God or have another religion. I realize that there are a lot of people here at LOCNAME that simply doesn't believe in God and I think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. I keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. I wish that everyone would be able to believe in God and receive the Eucharist everyday. It is the most amazing gift that God gave us. It's sad how some people just ignore God or sometimeseven laugh in His face. This was what I originally wanted to talk about when I was thinking about what I was going to write in this paper. I thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that I can write on but then I realized that I couldn't do that because it would have been planned. So I decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. For the most part I think that it worked because as I think back of all the things that I have written for the past 00 minutes I have gone through various different topics. Ranging from drinking, to girls, to God. I think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. I realize that the time is up and that I no longer need to be writing but I'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. I notice that I almost finished a complete page of writing.

__label__label0 Wow. what an assignment. I think this has got to be one of the easiest grades I have ever made. I am feeling a bit like PROPNAME PROPNAME (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). I am typing this in ORGNAME word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 0 times. Although I have Physics tomorrow, which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it. I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it. Plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, I suppose. I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. I have a friend, PROPNAME, who has gone through like 00 journals in the past 0 years. She tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. Which reminds me, I need to give her a call. I miss her. She goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (PROPNAME PROPNAME). We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. Well. I thought it was a bit humorous. I am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now. It is a really good feeling. We met last year, here in LOCNAME at debate camp. He is from LOCNAME (LOCNAME LOCNAME), so we spent just under a year living 0 hours apart from each other. All of my classes are going pretty good, although I still don't really have a clue what I want to major in just yet. I am in the college of Liberal Arts (woo hoo!) and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. I also want to go to law school. I seriously doubt I will get into ORGNAME's law school. It is way too competitive. * Sigh * who knows, I sure don't. I am living at PROPNAME right now, and let me tell youI am getting ripped off. It is $0000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 0nd floor (the "intensive study floor"), which I never signed up to be in. I guess it isn't all that bad though; at least I'm not at Jester. I don't have a car here because my parents are irrational. I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a "growing experience" for me. Although I only live around an hour or so away from here (LOCNAME, LOCNAME. near LOCNAME LOCNAME) I haven't been home since I have been here. I have no real desire to go home. I hated high school, well I hated it my senior year. All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I can't compete with some of the people here at LOCNAME, my high school didn't have much to offer. I have a good friend of mine (PROPNAME) that came and saw me the weekend before last. She is at ORGNAME and she hates it there. Although I miss her, I think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. She has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn't give her the time of day for the last 0 years of her life. Jocks and whatnot. Supposedly there is this annoying kid (who I started to resent in high schoolPROPNAME Hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. Scott and I were buds back in 0th grade and once we got to high school, I no longer existed. That happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. Back to PROPNAME, well she told me yesterday that she has "found God. " If only you knew PROPNAME, you would know that is a load of shit. If she is happy, then hey I am all for it, but I don't think it is something she'll stick with. I am not an atheist or anything but I just don't know and don't care to find out. I am not saying I won't be open to opinions and respectful of one's commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. I guess that is because of my parents. They use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn't let me go out or do anything on Sundays unless I went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) Alright. I have far surpassed the 00minute limit and I'm out. 
__label__label0 You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the ORGNAME suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the ORGNAME. I mean if you had PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the ORGNAME are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am! Its ok, one day, I will find the right one. 
__label__label1 Last Saturday, my parents sold the house that I have lived in my entire life. Even though it has been on the market for over a year, I was very upset. It seems to me as though my family is falling apart. I have three siblings, and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities. And since the place that my parents are moving to doesn't have rooms for us, where I am right now is my home now. Where my brothers and sister live is their home now, and it doesn't feel like we are a family anymore. Because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically. Even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown, LOCNAME, we couldn't. There are six of us in my family, and my parents only have one extra bedroom. My sister only has one extra bedroom, so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent's when we are in LOCNAME. It's so weird. I don't even know what I'm going to do when I drive past the house. I'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking. I do things like that all the time. Without thinking, one day, I drove to my best friend's house because I was thinking of her, and she wasn't even in town. I just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want. They are so excited about simplifying their lives, but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof. My family is the most important thing in my life, and I don't want that to change. I guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings. They were close friends with their siblings, and now they barely talk to each other. Now that my siblings and I are beginning to make families of our own, I don't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now. I've gone through life making friends and growing apart, and it has been really hard on me, but my family has always been there. Without that solid relationship, I don't know how life is going to be. 
__label__label0 Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. 
__label__label0 I am feeling a little nervous right now. I just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. Normally I wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. I walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. I never found it. Hopefully the fact that I was not in class will go unnoticed. I had a very busy day, and every little thing I do every day I have to think about twice. I can not react on impulse here in college, because if I do I could get into trouble with people I would rather not be in trouble with. If I do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. I got my ORGNAME wristband today. I had to get up very early in order to do this. I was tired out from last night as well. I have to get up early again on Thursday in order to get my actual ticket. The OU tickets are thirty five dollars. This is pretty expensive. From what I hear it is worth it though. A lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. We're going to take buses to LOCNAME and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. It sounds like a blast. One of my friends from high school moved to LOCNAME to go to ORGNAME for college. It will be good to see him. One of my other friends went to LOCNAME LOCNAME for college. I respect the guy with all my heart. I don't know how he does what he does. I got to see on Labor Day for the first time in like three months. That was really nice. He does not think that West Point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. The beginning of college has been fun so far. I've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. I enjoy living on my own. I live with three other guys from ORGNAME ORGNAME. They are all really cool. I enjoy private times sometimes too. It is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and I get the whole place to myself. It's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. They spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. It would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. I just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. Well it has been about twenty five minutes now so I am going to check spelling and submit my work. 
__label__label1 Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for ORGNAME ORGNAME and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named PROPNAME. She went to ORGNAME. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of PROPNAME. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. PROPNAME makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the LOCNAME LOCNAME has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. 
__label__label0 The first thought that enters into my mind is my parents, whom I have been thinking about since I left LOCNAME for college. It's so different here, but not necessarily bad. I have always been under the protection of my parents. But here, I don't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed, and what to do. I literally make all my choices, which I have to admit, I don't always make the best decisions. I don't study when I know I should. Sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that I know I should, and doing things like going out and having fun. I feel like I should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute. But back to my parents, I feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me, because I am the last kid to leave home. My mom has been crying constantly and I know that she is lonely because she doesn't have me bumming around the house and eating her food. Sometimes I even feel sad because I now realize all the things my parents have done for me. Even though I thought they were always against me. When I think about the things they have sacrificed for me, I get teary. Especially when I think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before I left for LOCNAME. I got an ORGNAME ORGNAME, nothing I had ever expected. I was so ecstatic and I had never gotten such a great present in my whole life. I know that my Dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than I had expected. And now I'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that I had taken for granted. I really miss my parents and sometimes I have trouble dealing with it. It's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own. My values are seriously getting tested because I don't have them to give me advice anymore. All I keep thinking is how much I love them and how I can possibly show my gratitude for them. College is a tough thing. Even though I went to an enormous high school, it can't compare to college. My classes are huge, and sometimes very monotonous and boring. Surprisingly, the class I had thought was going to be tough and boring, became one of my favorites, economy. Mainly because my professor, PROPNAME, is a great teacher. He is lively and so humorous. The other classes, I really don't care for much. One thing I do hate about college life is the roommates. I live off campus on LOCNAME, in a really nice apartment/condo. My dad bought it with the intention that I have a nice place to live. It is two stories, and I have been trying to decorate it the best that I can. But the problem is that I have to have roommates. One is this white girl, PROPNAME, who I never met. My dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in Austin, looking for a roommate and she applied. The other is a Chinese girl, PROPNAME, I have known since I was a child. I share a room with PROPNAME, so PROPNAME has her own room, and she pays a little more. However, I still end up paying more because it's not fair to split a 0000 rent 0 ways. So PROPNAME pays 000 for her own room, which I consider a good deal. PROPNAME is really messy, which bothers the heck out of me. But lately, I have been dealing with it pretty well. PROPNAME is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind. She is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household. But she is messy, especially in public areas and I am the one who has to clean up after her. And the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy. She has a big tv in her own room, and vcr and then on the other hand, comes and watches tv that PROPNAME and I own. So we are not allowed to use it. I borrowed her vcr the other day, and she asked me, "When are you going to buy your own vcr?" Still, she isn't willing to share but doesn't mind using our things. Same with the food. I really feel the need to tell her off, because she sure is getting a good deal living over here, and she can't have the right to treat this place as her own, she needs to respect us. Not only that, she hammered nails all up in her room, knowing that she is only living her for a year and it's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next. That's my biggest problem and whenever I talk about it, I feel really agitated and stressed. Well, all I feel now is relief though, because my 00 minutes are up!  
__label__label1 Okay. So I need to write what's on my mind. Right now all I can think of is that chemistry test I just took at 0:00am this morning. It was my first test in college I was scared as hell before I took it because I was scared I would run into problems I didn't know how to workout and I would not pass the test. Now I'm sitting in anxiety for the results. I keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm trying almost anything I can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. Goodness I feel so behind in my classes and I don't know why I mean I have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and I got time to relax, but can't. Again that stupid test is on my mind. Why does it torture me so? I'm sitting here praying I will get an 'A' on it because I gave it the best shot I could have even if I had studied continuously the whole week, I wouldn't have been able to do better. I guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. The entire thing was a review for me from chemistry II my junior year. My stomach is in huge knots and I feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and I don't like it. Those warning signs usually mean I'm in trouble for something, but I don't know why yet why I could be in trouble. I hate not knowing things. It makes me feel so vulnerable and I hate being put on a spot like that. My gosh I hope I didn't fail the test, otherwise I'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. I just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. I wish I could relax right now. Maybe I'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as I'm through typing this assignment I still have 0 more minutes according to the clock. Man, I really hope I run into PROPNAME today again that boy is really cute! But one thing puzzles me does PROPNAME like me? He always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us BULL CRAP THEY WILL! I think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. Man! that test, but it's not that anymore I feel like I'm in trouble and I don't know why is everything okay at home? I sure do hope so. Why do I concern my self so much everything will be okay no? Hey! need to write my cousins I really don't feel like writing PROPNAME now, I'll write him over the weekend when I go home. Man I've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 00 minutes are over I hope this assignment is long enough I don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind I've never done that I've always had to think what I write and it's terrifying because any minute I feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and I'll get a zero. 
__label__label0 I guess I'm just supposed to write what I'm thinking right now. I love listening to music. I guess it releases some kind ORGNAME hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. If I'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, I can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME is majoring in that I think. I really miss PROPNAME. He's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. I can't wait to talk to him today  I've already done all of my homework for today and I don't have any more classes today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my hard days. I had a rhetoric class that I was taking but I'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression  she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. I think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. I want to be happy when I'm older  I want to be a child psychiatrist. But as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so I'm going to have to wait on that one. I want to continue to medical school, but I don't know where I want to apply for that. I have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. Oh  My favorite song is on  one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. Okay I have ten more minutes. Okay, my shoes are too small! Have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? It really is painful  I hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 0 and a half and a 0 would make me look like I have clown feet. If you have size 0 feet I'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. I'm just talking about me. I hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else  you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. Maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. But who even cares about that stuff now. Not me! But that's okay. I took an ORGNAME ORGNAME course last year in high school and I loved it. It's what got me interested in Psychology in the first place. I was going to be a photojournalist. But after taking the psych class I decided that I really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. Photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. I also was watching a show on TLC on a family vacation to LOCNAME (dad's idea) and it was an ER show and I really thought that was interesting. I can be easily inspired. Okay my time is up. 
__label__label0 Ok, so I don't understand how people can get into relationships that are so suffocating. My friend was just telling me how his girlfriend was mad at just because he didn't call her right at 00am. He also told me that he couldn't tell his girlfriend that he was out with me at ORGNAME because then that would make her jealous. What kind of relationship is that when there is no trust, even though they say they love each other. Blah, blah, blah. They've been going out for less than 0 months and they are talking about love and marriage. I can't imagine falling in love so quickly. Maybe that is because I've never been in that situation before. My friends always ask why I don't date. I've been trying to figure out that myself. I usually use the "copout" answer that I don't have the time which is indeed true. I also think that I don't date because I haven't found the person who I click with. There are some friends I feel totally comfortable around, but they are too good of friends and that would be way too awkward. Supposedly, as others say, I could get any guy I want, but I totally doubt that. I guess I just have a low selfesteem, but I don't know. That's kind of an extreme statement to make. I think also I've been so independent all my life because of mommy and daddy always being at the restaurant that I basically raised myself. There could have been so many opportunities for me to turn bad, but I didn't. Yet, things my parents never think anything is good enough. I feel like they always see the bad in me. If I do something good, they praise that, but automatically follow with a negative quality about me. How do you think that makes me feel? What's the point of trying if nothing if ever good enough. I always do things to please others. I am doing pharmacy because my parents want me to and I don't want to disappoint them because I see how hard they work and what they have gone through with my brother. I sometimes get so depressed when I realize that they are putting all their hopes on me and they make me feel guilty when I don't do what they want me to do. Sometimes I feel it is too much pressure on me and I just want to cry and give up everything. Don't they understand that that is too much pressure for me and that I might crack one day and go crazy. Sometimes I always ask why me and why my family. like why are we going through these tough financial situations when we are such good people. But then I realize how lucky we are. We have a home, food, and all the people in my immediate family are healthy and living. I hear horror stories of what other people have to suffer through and I make it a point to not take anything for granted because EVERYTHING could completely change in a blink of an eye. I also ask why are all the girls so much prettier than me and why I'm not as smart as others. Then I hear kids that are born with mental retardation and makes me realize how lucky I am to be healthy and normal. It so hard sometimes to see of all the good things you have when you envy what others have. That's a serious problem I have. I should just be content with what I have and not worry about what others have. I like to be nice to others but when I see my friends giving more attention and things to my other friend who is always mean and whiney, what's the use of being nice and submissive. Why do all the good "guys" lose? I guess that is just how the world works and that is so pathetic. I guess that is how human nature is. I went to the UT Dance Clinic tonight and I wish I was good enough to make it. I just don't pick up combinations up as quickly as the other girls. I wish I could because I really want to make it. I love to dance. I wish I could do that for the rest of my life but I am not good enough to make it my profession. It is so relaxing and I truly love doing it. I don't think pharmacy is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It seems to boring. But I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. I guess I haven't found my niche in the world. I wish I just knew what I wanted to do and go with it. Why do I change my mind so often? Life would be so much easier if I could just figure out what exactly I wanted to do with my life. I just hope my future is all I hope it to be. happy, prosperous, healthy, and with someone I truly love. 
__label__label1 This computer lab, LOCNAME LOCNAME, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. 
__label__label1 As I begin writing this I am a little annoyed because I'm doing it on my friends computer mine is broken. I wish I could just get my computer to work and be dependable. Also as I'm typing I'm thinking ahead as of what to say I guess I shouldn't do that or maybe that's just the way I think. The phone just started ringing but I'm not even going to answer it. I've been laying around all night watching a movie with a girl I used to like a lot. She's a beautiful girl and part of me still likes her but oh well. Things are different now and I don't really mind that. Also I've recently decided that I didn't want to be in a fraternity. I always thought I would, but really it just wasn't my thing. Right now I'm kind of kicking myself because I'm missing out on partying, but at the same time I hated the amount of time I spent doing stuff at the house. I felt like every one was here to party and study on the side. I wish I could do that but I can't, I need to do well in school. This weekend is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I'm very excited. The concert is two nights and I'm going to both. PROPNAME is my favorite musician and I've been looking forward to it for a long time. Also it is very hot in this room where I'm typing I wish that I could just some how make it like fifty degrees in here. I really like the cold weather and am looking forward to a break from the heat in the upcoming months. I think I like the cold because I'm hot natured, but also because I have good memories of winters. I love to reflect on the Christmas with my grandparents. As I glance down at my watch I see that my time is almost up so I guess I'll try to muster something great up. I don't know I'm a blank. I do however miss my family a little. I really miss my brother. It's odd because we always used to annoy each other but now I'd really get a kick out of seeing him. 
__label__label1 I am sad. I just started thinking about the dog I left behind in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. That isn't exactly why I am sad though. It seems weird to me that I am really missing my dog and hardly ever thinking about my mom and dad. It isn't that I don't love my mom or dad but something must have gone wrong considering this is my first time away from them and I am hardly talking to them at all. If my mom sends me an email is usually says something like: nothing new here, PROPNAME's now. PROPNAME is my dog. I really feel like my dog is more important to my mom then I am. At least she has always spent more time with him. I am getting teary eyed which is weird because I haven't cried in years and I don't think I have anything to cry about now. My roommate's mom calls him every single night. I have talked to her more then I have talked to my mom since I have been here. I haven't heard a word from my dad at all. Oddly enough I don't really miss my friends back home. We have been very close since sixth grade and I just left them. For some odd reason this really doesn't bother me. I can't stop thinking about how much your class stresses me out. It seems so easy. I know it won't be easy though, and that makes we question how much time I should be spending on it now. I almost had a panic attack when I saw that the website was down but it is now back up and that makes me feel okay. I am really hungry which is weird because I just ate a piece of ham, a piece of turkey, sweet potatoes, a piece of pecan pie, broccoli and cheese, and a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. Isn't that nuts. PROPNAME 00/0 is now on. That is an awesome show. It really hits hard without showing gruesome ER scenes (it is a documentary series). I lost my train of thought and I am now writing about nothing. Well, my twenty minutes are up. Bye. 
__label__label0 Is ORGNAME ORGNAME for me? Should I have stayed with my friends in LOCNAME? I thought I was going to meet to meet a lot of new people here. I don't know what to do? Why am I here? I don't even know what I want to be. Is college even for me? I hate that song. I think I could be happy with a low paying job. I don't know. People here are different; maybe it's just me. College is supposed to be the best time. I over think everything. I should just go with the flow. Everyone tells me you will love it here once I meet a few people, but it seems unlikely. I have met a lot of new cool people, but I can't see them being as close as my friends back home. Even the girls here act differently. I have meet a lot of new girls, but it wasn't what I expected. It seems like I'm the only one who feels this way. I know I over think everything. Maybe I'm not giving U. T. a chance. I think I'm trying, but I feel awkward here. I worry way too much. I don't know why I always think about this. That music is loud. I hate complaining like this, its useless, but it's all I think about. Who knows maybe I'll meet new people when I go to I. S. A. tonight. But I know it's going to be like everything else, you might meet new people but you will never see them again or get to know them. I'm so glad I am going home this weekend. What will I do? 
__label__label1 Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to inform you of my recent achievements, thoughts, feelings, and general relevancy of life. I have been under some stress for the last few months due to recurring repercussions of the recent divorce of my parents. I am and have always been one who stands and is ready to be strong for others, but some time it takes more strength to cry. I am glad that my involvement in dancing had led me to this time so near my departure for the Olympics. This had helped to separate me from the hectic antics of family. Although it has given to great an amount of time to reflect upon my inefficiencies. Again as I type I am thinking I am wondering as if this incoherent gibberish will be or can plausibly be translated into recognizable human thought and used in my aid. This in itself has become a major threshold of relief for me. Confrontation of my fears has always been a struggle. Fears a plague of man for centuries, we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being. See, as I continue I have diverged farther and continued in my pursuit of happiness and my race against fear. I fear that I am losing control. Not of myself but of family. They stray farther and farther from the objective, but seem to relentlessly ignore the many warnings and offers of aid from their peers. Is it true that we are not safe from torment even without villain, or can it be that the most prevalent villain be he who lives within us. Tearing at each muscle and heartstring, pulling our every emotion straight from the gates of happiness to the pits of despair. I've dug myself into this hole and finally confessed, but the only my own strength can bring me out. Ironic isn't it. I am not nearly psycho or even remotely suicidal, but life can bring one down. A carefree person is at the greatest risk, because it is with that lack of care that you neglect to watch for the advance of the ranks of despair. I have yet to find the reason or meaning behind any so feelings. Let alone answer any thoughts or feelings of my own, but simple writing forms a haven, safe place, or a virtual escape from the locks of my own mind. Only as I overcome the fallacies that I have founded my realities upon, may I escape the shackles of my own torment. I really have no problems, other than an overly kind heart and mind that troubles me more than worth. How can I escape my own shackles when it is by the same power that I am confined that I am held captive. My thoughts are low and stamina lost but open freely now are the gates of hope. Once again proving that the pen is far mightier than the sword. 
__label__label1 What is going through my head. hmmm. That's a good question. Well. I feel really skeptical about this whole college thing. I mean its all cool and all but I get a little intimidated by the whole process. I mean all these people in my classes kind of freak me out. I am used to dealing with large amounts of people but WOW. I sit there and wonder how the professors do it all. I mean yes, they have teacher's aides, but I am sure that the work is tremendous. All the schoolwork is a little new to me. I am used to a lot of busy work and worksheet. Don't get me wrong. I was in advanced classes, but I am not that used to every class having mandatory readings all the time. I am also a little scared of going out. I was always a social person in high school but the whole going out and meeting new people is a little scary. I mean, the people seem really friendly and nice, but a lot of them seem really snobby and a little unapproachable. so it makes a person hesitate. I am really an outgoing girl but I hesitate for some reason here. In other environments, I usually don't. It is strange though. It like I am afraid of making new friends. How silly is that??? Also, I am afraid of the whole freshman 00 thing. I mean, how could people gain weight? You walk around all day and go to class. And when you're not doing that you are reading or going out? Well, I know the food isn't that great, but 00 pounds! Wow! Also, this whole party scene is a bit intimidating for me. I want to go, but I am so scared because of all the storied I've heard. Funny what you realize when you just sit here and let your mind go. I need to learn to type faster so I can go as fast as I am thinking. Oh well. that's what you get for not taking keyboarding in junior high. Well. I am thinking my 00 minutes of typing is up. So I will check all my spelling and turn this in. 
__label__label1 I'm sitting here listening to a trance cd of jimmy van M who I recently saw at LOCNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. As best as I can express my sensations and reactions to this music something will always be left unsaid. The music is a magical, emotional journey that not many people understand. Those that do, however, are purveyors of another plain of consciousness that will forever stay with them. A grammatical explanation is hard to find when most people are entirely withheld from experiences that have the guaranteed potential to alter people's lives. I often think of PROPNAME PROPNAME's idea. "Far better it is to dare mighty things than to take rank with those poor timid spirits who know neither victory or defeat. " I for one am a great example of the power that is contained in some of the things I've experienced. I wish I could really delve into these things sometimes without hesitating with regards to the repercussions. But, then again, the leap of faith is something everyone must do on their own. Someone can only be shown the door. You must have the initiative within to step across it on your own. As much as I've seen and endured I sometimes wonder if I really have seen everything that is the best. Then I remember what I thought before my experiences and I know that there is still so much more out there for me to jump on. Avoiding selfdestruction is also a daunting task sometimes and an everpresent one. One I am no longer fearful of fulfilling. Life really is too short to worry a fraction as much as most people do. This is a cold, hard fact. I'll be damned if I'll be lying on my deathbed reminiscing about all the missed opportunities. I'll croak knowing that I choked everything out of life and then some, and then a little more. 
__label__label0 trying to track how my mind works. I have so many different things going on in my head right now. mainly worries. I have so much to do and it seems like so little time. the scholarship, the basta website, the volunteer tutoring thing. I don't know if I'll be able to finish everything. I feel so drained, so tired. oh well. nothing is as it seems. blah, I feel like I need to just stand in a field and scream at the top of my lungs and let all this worry all this frustration everything that is inside me just come out. maybe then I can relax. I worry too much occupy my mind with so many different things I sometimes feel like my head is going to explode. ay diosito santo que vida. yawn. I feel like I need a vacation. a six month vacation away from everything. no classes, no relationship problems. or I should say breakup. I know that this is part of the problem. I've spent three years with adrian and now from one day to the next he wants things to be over. because he's not sure how he feels. we survived a year in a long distance relationship and now nothing. oh well. not much you can do. I feel sad. lonely overwhelmed at times. but I have good days. days when I feel like I could go on forever just plowing through the week the months the year until I finish my program. then what after that. I feel like I don't have a direction. I have a ba, worked as a teacher in ny for a year, now back in school to finish a certificate program. but then what I want to go to grad school, to law school maybe, but when. what if I don't make it then what. I have no plan. I feel like I just am trying to figure out what I need or want to do. who am I really. what am I going to do. I need a good day of just sleep. that would be really nice right about now. a day of sleep, of rest with no interruptions, no worries just sleeping. I don't even want to dream. just that kind of dead to the world thing. no time though. too much to do too many things going on. deadlines and commitments and work and school and everything in between. gosh I've been rambling, but not saying much really. stream of consciousness assignment. seems forced. are these really my true thoughts or thoughts only in response to an assignment. I think I'm thinking too much. what time is it anyway. time to stop maybe. twenty minutes translates to a good number of thoughts huh. time to go, I've got errands to run. what time is it anyway. good only about thirty seconds left. 
__label__label0 I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 00. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I hope me three friends from LOCNAME can come visit me. It'll be all of them, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, my mom, and my two sisters. PROPNAME's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. PROPNAME made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with PROPNAME and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 00 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either ORGNAME ORGNAME or the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. PROPNAME is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 0:00. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call PROPNAME by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 0, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like PROPNAME PROPNAME typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. 
__label__label1 Well, I'm sitting here at my computer on my desk thinking about what to write  gosh I cannot spell right now  this is really frustrating. It's different when you type this kind of assignment because when you write things on paper, you don't have to worry about misspelling anything because you are writing and when you type, sometimes your fingers don't type the right keys and everything gets all messed up. Well I'm going to see my boyfriend in about a week and a half my hands and fingers are getting tired of typing  and his picture is right here on top of my desk. He is so wonderful. I wish we weren't at different colleges. It would be so much easier if we were in the same city so we could see each other more often, It's only been 0 minutes since I've been doing this and I have 00 more minutes this is going to be a really long assignment. It seemed easy when I heard about it, but it really isn't that easy. My fingers really hurt and I wish I could just write this out, but I guess you have to have it in email format. Well I'm really anxious to see my boyfriend. Every time I think about him I get a really big smile on my face. I told him that even when I talk to people, sometimes I'll just smile in the middle of what I am saying because I'm thinking about him. He's in LOCNAME, going to PROPNAME. I was really interested in PROPNAME a couple of years ago because my cousin, who's 0 years older than me, went there and he really liked it there. Anyway, I've been trying to book a bus ride over there, but it's pretty hard to do that, especially when I'm trying to juggle my tine between trying to book the ride and going to class and everything like that. But hopefully it'll all work out ok. It's going to be really fun because I haven't seen him since he left for LOCNAME on August 00th. It's been so long since I've seen him. We talk on the phone occasionally, but that gets really expensive really quickly and so most of the time we just email each other and I'M each other. But his schedule is so different from mine and its hard to talk especially when I need to study but I really want to talk to him. It's so hard. Ands all this studying is getting me tired. It's only the 0th day of class and already I feel burned out from all the reading and everything ok  I think it's been about 00 minutes, uh oh  I stopped writing because I lost track of how long I have been writing but now I know so that's' good. Gosh my fingers hurt. I've never typed this much before with out taking a break. PROPNAME ok, I need to get my wrist pad because they hurt. All right, that's better. Now, back to PROPNAME  that's his name. He's supposed to get online again at midnight and I really hope he does. He's been going to bed really early lately and it sucks because then I can't talk to him as much as we normally talk. I love him so much. It hurts inside to think of him and I really want to be with him right now. But I don't want to talk about that to you because it's my problem, that's why I'm going to see him next Friday. I'm so excited to see him. He's seriously the best thing to happen to me for a really long time. We've gone out before, actually my freshman year of high school we were dating and we've been going out off and on since then. I seriously think we were made for each other. He is so sweet and he's really in touch with his sensitive side, and that really turns me on in a guy. I like it when guys cry too. I mean, not too much, because then it seems like they're too sensitive, but if he cries a little, it means he's sensitive and that totally turns me on. Anyway, I'm probably leaving next Thursday so that I can spend the night with my other friend, PROPNAME, who also goes to Rice. I'm going to go to a party on Friday night with her and PROPNAME and then I'll spend the next two nights with PROPNAME (but we aren't going to do anything) that's another thing I really admire about him is that we both have the same morals and expectations and he is really sensitive to my feelings and wants. He has got to be the best thing going for me right now  besides of course being at ORGNAME. That is really awesome too. Anyway, I'm running about of things to say, oops that didn't make much sense, but I'm almost done  hooray! Anyway, I'm staring at my really bright yellow hilighter right now and It hurts my eyes. I need to go pick up my football tickets tomorrow after my philosophy class because I'm in the draw. I wonder how I can get 0 tickets besides mine  that makes a total of 0 tickets. My whole family is coming up to LOCNAME for the LOCNAME game on the 00rd because my birthday is the 00th and we are celebrating it that Saturday. Well, it's been about 00 minutes so I guess my first official psychology writing assignment is done. That makes me feel good. Well, bye! 
__label__label0 Well I guess my first thought would be that I don't think the assignment is really fair. I don't really mind it but the fact is that people who type faster will in fact have to write more. I type quite well so this applies to me. I don't really know what else to say so I guess I will just talk. I am 00 I don't like things. I don't like a lot of things. I am very judging of people and things. Everywhere I go I am sizing things up. I don't know why I do this, perhaps it is some sort of defense mechanism that I use to protect myself. I don't know once again. I have a girlfriend of seven months who has actually helped me with this very much. Just the thought of her brings me comfort and calms me down considerably. I don't sleep very well anymore. I used to sleep quite well but now that all of these changes in my life have occurred I am having trouble adjusting. One thing I have noticed about myself just now is that I complain a lot. Well, I noticed it before now but this helps. I will try to be more positive for the rest of the time. I like things. I like a lot of things. I like music, especially the PROPNAME PROPNAME's Band. I am going to go to a concert of theirs in LOCNAME of Friday. I am really looking forward to it. I come from a great family. My parents are one of the few couples in the world today who are still married. I like other things too, just let me think for a second. I like birds. Birds are the luckiest animal on earth. They get to fly around all day and laugh at people. My philosophy professor stated a quote from a book about utilitarianism. It said that no intelligent human, no matter how unhappy he or she is would rather be an animal with infinite animal pleasures. I would have to disagree with this statement because I think if given the chance I would be a bird. Maybe I would even be a flying squirrel. I also like movies. I watch them all the time. I used to rent like six a night from the video store but I am really lazy. I sleep late and don't return them on time. I therefore incur late fees. I know what is going on though with this whole return them by noon bit. They know people like me won't wake up by twelve so they will rake in the late fees. They pawn this off as a bonus because you are getting twelve extra hours of movie watching time when in fact all you are getting is twenty or so dollars in late charges. I am aware of many scams. I don't really want to go into them right now because I am afraid of what the proponents of such scams will do to me if I reveal their secret. That last line wasn't true. I made it up. This is a trait I picked up from my friend who moved to ORGNAME ORGNAME. We would all sit around talking and making up elaborate, obviously fake stories just to make each other laugh. So in the memory of my old friend I hope that made you laugh. My twenty minutes are now up so I hope you enjoyed my train of thought. I'm not sure if this is what I was supposed to do but I guess it doesn't matter since it is a completion grade. So I must say goodbye for now. Peace. 
__label__label1 The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is an immense feeling of relief. I have just finished the rough draft of my Rhetoric paper. It's due tomorrow and I wasn't sure I could pull it together. It's not up to the standard of writing I like, but that's why it's a rough draft. I find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since I got here. I know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. The first night I was here, I was sitting back listening to my music and reading when I thought about home and everything that had gone on there. I remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. It wasn't homesickness. Something about the song I was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky I am. I've had a great life. My parents were very supportive in whatever I did and still are. My friends were always there for me and I never endured any life tragedies. The truth is that I really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. It just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what I personally considered an ideal life. I really do think I've led an ideal life. Never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. The only thing I consider a life tragedy is the fact that I didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and I fought to hard to get here to not come. I think that I'll love it here. Actually, I already do. Most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. I don't see how. The people around me are great, my classes interest me, and I'm never bored. I don't not miss home, but I'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. As far as I'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. I'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. This weekend I'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which I am finding myself attracted to. The next weekend is another football game. I'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. Marching in front of 00,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. Of course, that's only half the fun. The real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. I'm glancing at my clock and see that I've only got about ten minutes left? How am I going to ramble on for another ten minutes. I write fiction stories for fun, love English, and am a Journalism major. Rambling writing style for me. I wonder why I'm occasionally having trouble continuing. Who knows? Psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. Maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. This is harder than I thought. Maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. When I write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. A plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. Just writing off the top of my head is something new. Well, not new, but usually the ideas I get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and I can plug them into a structure. That's actually how I start a lot of my English papers. Start off the top of my head and find a flow. After that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on. 
__label__label1 I have done this twice now and erased it both times. I wish I could do it on a different program but my computer is broken and I don't exactly know how to use my neighbors that is letting me borrow hers. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately. I guess I'm finally realizing that I'm here for good. I'm used to going on long trips in the summer so I know what it's like to be away from home and my mom and dad but this is so different. It feels like it's a point with no return. Even if I live with them during the summer which is a possibility it won't ever be the same. The days of grade school at home are over. I really miss my mom. She is my best friend. Really though so is my dad and my brother PROPNAME. It is amazing how close we are. I feel so fortunate. In my marriage and family class we talked about a healthy and strong family and I feel like my family met most all of the items on the list. We have so many memories together. I'm so lucky to have my brother. My brother's good friend died when they were in 00th grade. It was the hardest thing ever for our youth group at church. I miss my church so much. It is such a home to me. My best friends are from my church. It is so sad that I will never be in a youth group again as a youth. I ay end up going on trips as a sponsor or something but it will never be the same. I'm at somewhat of peace with the change but it still makes me sad when I realize the little things like not having to rush around on Sundays in order to be back for choir, supper, and bible study. The things that can drive you crazy are the things you miss. I miss my cat. He is so old. I remember when he was a tiny baby in 0000. He find us and adopted us. We named him PROPNAME PROPNAME after PROPNAME PROPNAME' wife who we were voting for that year (it was Election time) but soon found that he was a he so we changed it to PROPNAME. Everyone says that it sounds like a big dog's name but oh well. He is an orange tabby cat. It seems like he used to be fatter but maybe I've just gotten bigger. We've been through a lot. W e used to play together all the time. I'd sing to him when he was a baby. Without my brother I would be such a different person. He has helped form me in so many ways. He is my hero. I think the world of him. I didn't always though, like when he would hit me on the head or do "gross" things in my face as a normal big brother should do. But I'm very lucky to be so close to him. I try not to talk about him around PROPNAME, PROPNAME's little sister. When he died she was in 0th grade. They were so close. I remember it all like it was yesterday. Getting the call at 0 the next morning. I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group. I talked to PROPNAME about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade. She broke down one night in LOCNAME when we were on mission tour. We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings. She just broke down which was a first. I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about PROPNAME around her because PROPNAME and him were the same age. She said that she loved hearing about PROPNAME but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly. She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it. My brother is getting married this summer. It is so strange. I love PROPNAME. She is already just like my sister. They have been together for four years now. At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother's best friend. I soon realized that we had very different places in PROPNAME's life and that there is room for both of us. I have PROPNAME' past and we both have his future. My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east LOCNAME and have the best time. PROPNAME and I would play so hard. On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream. PROPNAME would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods. It's funny what a family thinks is so humorous that would mean nothing to others. On the way down he would always try to explain the wonders of the earth to my mom and me like the stars and solar system and physics and things that PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME would probably never grasp. That's one thing I adore about my family. We all contribute different things. We are so different but so alike. I miss days of being with just us. We always traveled a lot. I think I'm just trying to let go of that time in my life right now. With me leaving for college and PROPNAME getting married, it's a whole new chapter. We have the best traditions. Even food traditions like Chicken and Cheese soup on Christmas Eve and Asparagus on Easter. I hope to start traditions with my own family. I miss my room, my bed, my church, the familiarity of LOCNAME LOCNAME roads, my boyfriend PROPNAME and his house and my best friends from church. PROPNAME would be a fantastic husband and father. I always say that if I don't marry him than I'll marry someone just like him. I wonder how my parents came up with our traditions. Like every Christmas Eve, PROPNAME and I open one present, an ornament. Mine are always angels and his are always bears. Eventually we added my mom and dad with cats and LOCNAME's. My mom doesn't even like cats. When she was little her dad expected her to like the animals and be near them so I think that's why she doesn't like them. They had a farm. She hated her dad. I can't imagine. When we drive to LOCNAME to see my grandmother, we always have very soul bearing conversations, some of our best in fact. She would always tell me about her childhood because I was so interested. Her dad was so difficult. In two weekends we're all going to PROPNAME, Ok. My uncle is coming in from LOCNAME so we all are driving in. It will be great. I'm very close to my cousins and I really don't see them that often at all. At Thanksgiving when we were little we used to all cram into my Grandmother's house and each get one kernel of corn at our place which represented one thing we were thankful for. We each said it aloud before we ate. Another great tradition. 
__label__label1 Okay. I don't really know what to write. being timed really makes me nervous no matter what I have to do. I have to study for Chemistry. and my roommate is standing over my shoulder. which makes me even more nervous! Ahh! Hmm, what am I going to become when I grow up? I don't know if I have what it takes to become a doctor! And my dad wants me to become an architect now! Oh geeze. I think I'm just going to have to give this all to the Lord. Oh Lord! Anyway, there's so many things I have to do. but all I really want to do is nothing. isn't that a classic? I feel like I'm getting fatter, and I know that I shouldn't be worrying about getting fat since most people consider me average and say that I'm already skinny enough, but I think that being in a ballet company my Jr. year of High School really messed up my mind. They told me to lose 0 lbs or more, and now I'm always so concerned about my weight. Ahh, I love ballet, but I don't think I'll ever want to really become a professional ballerina. even though my ballet teacher really really wants me too! I'm really hungry right now. I want to eat some more Mexican food. Mmm. Mexican food. too bad there's nothing good to eat in the fridge downstairs. bummer. Oh Lord help me! I think I'm starting to get really homesick now; I miss my mommy and my daddy. But most of all, I miss my brother! I want to go to LOCNAME! I want a big cold front to come in soon. I can't stand this hot humid weather anymore. even though I'm used to it (since I'm from LOCNAME). My back hurts. I think it's from trying to work out on my roommate's torso track. Actually, every part of my body hurts right now. I wish someone in the house knew how to give really good massages right now because I could really go for one right about now. I'm dead tired too. but I can't go to sleep since I have to study for my stupid Chemistry quiz tomorrow. Ughghh. I hate Chemistry so much! And what makes it suck even more is that I'm such a terrible student. I wish I was diligent with my studies and all, but I just can't seem to manage my time right! And I can never seem to set my priorities straight! Oh Lord! I'm such a failure! I have so many weaknesses and shortcomings it's awful. Is my time up yet? Oh darn. I still have a ways to go! I want to go to sleep! My eyelids are drooping. I guess I should have been smart and done this a little earlier. but like I said I don't manage my time efficiently. I wonder if the person reading this is actually reading this carefully or just breezing by it to see if I actually did the assignment and put some effort into it. Do you call this effort? Because it is. it really is. I think I'll go to the architecture library tomorrow. hmm. I hope that cute guy's there! Ha! (like I'm going to do anything really. I'm actually really well preserved. I'm a preserved vessel never dated, never gone to a party, never done drugs, smoked, drank. never done any of that stuff. and it's all because I love the Lord, and I want to be "well pleasing in His eyes". therefore, I must present my body as a "living sacrifice to Him" because. it should no longer be " I who live, but PROPNAME who liveth in me") Oh. I'm so ready to stop now! I want to go shopping! But I feel so poor! I am poor actually. I don't have any money. and neither does the rest of my family. We live on scraps. I guess you could say! I'm so glad we could afford to send me to college! But my brother and sister will have to slave to help finance my way through these 0 years. Oh Lord! Yea! My time's up!  
__label__label1 My first week here at LOCNAME, I went through rush. I was kind of pressured into it by family and friends, but I also wanted to meet people. After a week of being fake and smiling a whole lot, I was invited into a sorority. I'm not the type of girl that loves having a ton of girlfriends, doing hair and make up, and talking about boys. I personally like to keep most of my feelings to myself and doing my own hair (which includes washing it only). I'm not into curling irons or the right eyeliner. Those things just really don't concern me. That is what I thought sorority girls were like. Some of them are girly girls, but I found a few to click with. I'm still not really sure about the whole Greek life thing, but I'm going to try it for a while. The part I really don't like is the whole politics of the whole thing. It is very harsh and costs a lot of money. But, like I said, I'm going to try it. Nothing about college has really surprised me yet, and I haven't really been that homesick, which is a very good thing. I do miss my pets back home and my best friend, but the people here are all so nice and friendly that it makes it a lot easier. I am a little nervous about some of my classes but hopefully that will die down after the first test. I was thrilled when I realized my roommate was normal and the fact that we get along so well. Right now I think I need to focus on getting more sleep and not getting sick. I know I have plenty of time to go out and have fun and I need to learn to study. My parents keep on stressing to me how important it is to go to class and I know that and I haven't missed a class yet and don't plan on it. I want to do well but have fun at the same time. I don't really know what else. The Emmy's are on right now and I really want to watch them. I'm obsessed with tv and movies. I seriously think I watch a movie a day and I guess that is good because ORGNAME is my major. I have a really cute picture of my best friend and I sitting on my desk right now and looking at it is making me want to call her, which I think I will do now. 
__label__label0 I enjoy my life so much right now, but I am also at a really tuff time in my life right now. I love PROPNAME and LOCNAME, but my boyfriend lives back home. Things are great between us, but it is so hard not being able to see him everyday. I miss the little things, like just being able to drive 0 minutes to go to his house, now it takes me over three hours to go to his house. I guess though that when I do get to see him, that the time we spend together is more valuable. I never realized how much we took for granted the fact that we used to live so close together. Now just to hear his voice costs money. I miss him so much. I have faith that things will work out between us, it is just going to be a long hard road through college. We have a lot of growing up to do though too. We both have a huge jealously problem, which is part of the reason we broke up the first time we were together. Whenever trusted each other enough to let the other one go out with their friends, so we were always together, and eventually I guess we just got bored of each other. I think the biggest mistake we ever made, was breaking up because a lot of things happened during the time we were broken up that puts strain on our relationship now. Although I have to thank my parents for sending me down to provisionals this summer, because when I left, PROPNAME realized that if we did not work things out soon, we were never going to be together again, because I was not going to wait around for him. I love PROPNAME so much, I thank God everyday that I met him. He has been my best friend for three years now, and I couldn't think of anyone that has helped me through as much stuff as he has. He has always been there for me, except for when we broke up, and he only left because it hurt him to be around me. Other than that PROPNAME is the person that has helped me through the toughest times in my life. No matter what happened during the day, Adam can always make me feel better. He can make all my worries fade. 
__label__label1 My main thoughts right now consist of music. I am thinking of a new song that I wrote about my thoughts on the people that I have seen at LOCNAME. Music I feel is the greatest thing in the world because I get to release all my emotions through a song. I think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. These reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. Surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. I don't believe any of them write their own songs, so I can't see why people would think they are talented. This brings me to something else I do not like about people, they are generally fake. What I mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. For example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. This things I do not do and hopefully never will. I feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. I thought by coming to ORGNAME that I would see less of this type of attitude from people but I now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. From this point I would like to say that UT is great(except for parking)and that I do like more people here then I did in high school. I am not sure what I want to do with the education I am receiving from this school but I hope that very soon I will recognize my calling in life. 
__label__label0 My mind is wandering back and forth between what I want to do and what I need to do. I need to study, read about a dozen chapters out ORGNAME my textbooks and learn the material inside and out, but I don't want to. I want to just remain calm and lie down on my bed with no worries and no setting of the alarm clock. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I'm actually in a rather uncomfortable state of mind right now, or in reality, I've been in that state of mind since the first day of school. It seems I have lost a lot of my drive and motivation, but I'm trying to gain it back. I want it BACK! Anyway, I am somewhat depressed and sad and I just feel uneasy. I want to be able to give my emotions freely, love in particular, but something always holds me back. Maybe I'm scared, I don't know. What am I going to do with my life? Now that's a question which really needs an answer, but do I have oneno, not me! I am currently a biology major, but I don't know if that is what I want to do. I don't want to go to medical school, but I don't know what else would be really interesting for me. I am very scared that I'm not going to find out what I want to be or should be and then I'm just going to be stuck. Competition is awful, especially between siblings. My brother knows what he wants to do, and I am 000% certain that he will be successful, in fact I know that he would be great at anything he decided to do. That's what I wantI want to know that I'm going to make it without a doubt or hesitation. This is the lack of motivation, inspiration, confidence, or whatever, I was referring to earlier. I use to be very strongwilled and I always set my mind to something and did it. Now, I know I still do that to a certain degree, but not as much, I WANT IT BACKNOW! I'm lonely and tired. I want to find some really good people who I can become really good friends with, but for some reason, I'm really not looking that hard. My social skills have also decided to go into hibernation for a while. Consequently, its my first year at ORGNAME ORGNAME of ORGNAME, surrounded by 00,000 people, and I don't even go out of my way to meet new people. That is something that is really starting to bother me, but hopefully as I get more familiar and comfortable with the system and environment everything will end up working out by itself. See normally, my thought would be that I would change and rise to the challenge because that's me, but not now, now I am depending on a nonexistent entity to "work out by itself. " Oh well, something needs to change. 
__label__label0 I was just thinking about how different college is from high school. I haven't come home from going out every night until 0am and I think my roommate is getting really upset with me. I feel bad because she never goes out and when I tell her I'm going out I think she feels left out. I am going to start inviting her. We knew each other in high school and now we're living together which is kind of weird but it's working out really well. People always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but it's been working so far. She is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meit's fun. I just broke up with my boyfriend of 0 years last weekend. That was really tough because we were so close. He doesn't go to ORGNAME so that was making it really difficult. I miss him. I am dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated a year earlier. He's really cool and we get along but it isn't the same. We'll just see how it works out. I miss my family. I am so used to seeing them everyday and now that I don't it's weird. I was so ready to get out of the house but now that I am officially out it's sad. I feel so old. I have to be independent which stinks. When I first got here, my computer wasn't working so I had to take it to the repair place and I got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously. That was kind of liberating, though. Doing something important by yourself. I was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant. I always had my mom do it. So, coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird. I haven't had much homework lately. I thought college was really tough and so far it really hasn't been. My roommate has tons of homework every night and I just haven't. I feel like I am missing out on the college experience. Today, I am going to College Station to visit my friend. We are going to see PROPNAME PROPNAME in concert which will be totally awesome. I love PROPNAME PROPNAME. My roommate is going to the Dave Matthews Concert in DallasI am jealous. she has been home every weekendthat's probably not healthy. Her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him a lot. I think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home. I don't really think she is homesickjust bored. Austin is such a great citypeople always told me that once you go to Austin you won't want to leave. I can see how that can happen. There's always something to do. I am starting to run out of things to talk aboutI think my 00 minutes are almost over. I found somethingthe Freshman 00. I am not going to gain thatbut, I can definitely see how that happens. You definitely have more spare time in college than we did in high school. I was really busy in high school. I was on drill team and I had practice every night until 0. I didn't have much time to myself. Now I do. I get bored. My dad just got a new car. It's weird that he has a new car and I've never seen it. My little sister had her 00th bday yesterday and she told my momwhen is sara coming home? My mom said, she lives three hours away, she can't come home tonight because she'll have to drive back for class the next day. When my mom told me that I started crying because it hasn't hit my little sister yet that I moved out. We used to not be close but we are nownow that we are growing up. Well, my 00 minutes are upit's been nice talking to you. 
__label__label1 There are some very strange things on TV. I don't watch TV all that often, but when I do it gets stranger and stranger. I love to eat. I eat constantly. Sometimes I wonder what it really is driving me to eat all of the time. Crunch and PROPNAME is the snack of choice for me at the moment. Buttery toffee popcorn with peanuts, it is funny to think why it is so good. But it is intriguing. Why do people change? I often wonder why she did it to me, what did I do to deserve it? I thought she was my friend, but I guess I was wrong. Without trust, friendship means nothing. I often think of this as I look at my relationships with other people, do I really trust them? I wonder why I sit and harass myself with the torture of scrutinizing every aspect of my life. Why do I? I know there is nothing wrong with me, yet I still sit here and ask myself what I could do differently. I need to accept that people do change, including myself. I believe I am addicted to Instant Messaging. It is a remarkable invention. To be able to "talk" instantaneously with my friends all over the country is just unbelievable. I can carrying on a conversation with as many people as I can handle at one time, but usually I just stick to two or three or it becomes too much to handle. I don't even know if this is making any sense, but I don't really care. The thing with instant messaging is that I have an obsession with wondering who is on or who is getting off, I have to check every time I hear the sound of the door opening and closing, even if I have no intention of actually talking to anyone. Why do I play mind games all of the time? I really do. I sit here and plot ways to make him want me or make him think I am mad or happy or whatever. I seriously need to quit eating this crap. It may taste good, but I know it can't be good for me. This is ridiculous, I really do need to stop eating. 
__label__label1 . Stream of consciousness well, in other words, free association. I can accommodate this assignment. It's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied. As I was walking home from a stressful day of calculus, chemistry, and psychology, I passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building. The animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking. On normal circumstances, squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans. However, this squirrel continued to hunt for food as I walked by it. I stopped and watched it, it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object, try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent. Curious I continued to watch, wondering what else it would do. I approached the squirrel, closer and closer. When I had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground, attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings. Fantastic! I never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself. I had always thought they would run and jump away. I remained crouched on the sidewalk as I continued to watch this curious little squirrel. After some time it started slowly approaching me. I continued to watch it, much like a predator stalking its prey. Without motion or movement I crouched and stared at it. It came to within 00 inches of me. How wonderful! The squirrel wasn't afraid to come towards a human. It remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel. Of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances. I was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel. At one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street, it found a mass of dumped bread. The rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory. Once there the squirrel began to eat. After eating half of the portions, he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread. Not finding a place, I began to try to help. I grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel. I realized I was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building. I was trying to help my new little friend. Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people. I felt anger, why would someone do that, I'm interacting with this squirrel. After it ran into the tree, it didn't come back down. At some point I left. In retrospect, I think I spent almost 00 minutes observing the squirrel. I was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions, but afterwards, amazingly, I was calm and I actually had an enjoyable time playing with it. I also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel. I never knew that they were as smart as I observed, I also realized even more what incredible running, jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have. Some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste, but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening. Many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world. A squirrel having so many complexities. Amazing. What about the human being or the human mind. The complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible! So many questions. It's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting. Wow very very crazy. 
__label__label1 Well currently I am stressed out. It is as if I have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. My academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. I am so used to being involved to the point that I came to college and repeated the same cycle. My grades reflect this. I just want to get at least a 0. 0 and go to a decent medical school. My sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. All of my friends want to become members. I am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. My line sisters reiterate to me daily that I must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. At our interests meetings we turn mean. How can I hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. I don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and I want to maintain that level of friendship. They look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. My first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. My second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. They'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. I have so much on my mind that I believe my mind is going to overload and explode. Must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time  
__label__label1 I do not want to draw that apple again. It's so redundant that it completely diminishes the idea of art. I mean, I understand that Professor PROPNAME wanted us to experience the "discipline" aspect of art, but it's really hard to express yourself with a piece of fruit. It's not even like one of those beautiful pieces of fruit you see in most paintings. It's from the LOCNAME LOCNAME, so of course it looks like it's been through hell. I can't believe I paid seventy cents for it. That's relatively cheap, but it's a bruised, disgusting piece of fruit. The food there is expensive compared to the quality of it. Day before yesterday, I paid almost three dollars for a bowl of wilted salad and a glass of tea. Maybe I'm just being cheap, well, actually it's my parents money, so it really doesn't affect me, but still. I need to call my parents. You'd think emailing them everyday and calling them every other day or like every three or four days would be enough. But no, they insist that we talk every day so that my mom can whine about how she really wants me to come back home and go to PROPNAME. I know she's not being serious, they really want me here, but the whining gets really old, really fast. I'm so glad I got away from that area, it's such a hellhole. Everyone knows everyone else's business. I guess that's typical of a small town, but I hate it. Here no one cares who you are. I guess there are good and bad sides of that, but mostly good. My roommate is so loud. She's really nice and all, but she's a little annoying. She's also extremely hypocritical. She claims to be so openminded and liberal, but then I've heard her put down people who are religious, which is really closeminded. I was offended by it, too, I mean she knows that I'm a Christian and she knows that I go to church, which, by most standards is considered "religious". Oh well, I haven't been "preachy" about my views, so I guess I'll just attribute her closemindedness to ignorance. I really want to go to the Counting Crows concert, I'll have to get the tickets soon though. PROPNAME PROPNAME voice is so powerful. Anyone who can evoke so much emotion from listeners using a song, has to be a musical genius. I mean how is it possible that I didn't cry when my parents left me here in a city of a million people, five hundred miles away from home. Yet, I cry when I hear him sing about a lost love. I don't even think it's the words that get me. Well, that could be part of it, but I guess it's the combination of the music and the lyrics and PROPNAME crooning them out. I mean, I could be in a perfectly good mood, and I listen to a song, and halfway through it tears are streaming down my face. And I do this to myself repeatedly. It's almost like a sickness, maybe I have OCD or something. I hardly ever become emotional at movies or other times when the typically "sensitive" girl would cry. Maybe subconsciously I know that I need to cry at certain times, and that's what makes me listen to the music. 
__label__label0 Things have changed so much since I got to college. Everything has taken a complete and utter flipside to the norm. I came here with two of my best friends from high school and now we are no longer speaking. Things get complicated. My plans for the upcoming and muchawaited Texas/Oklahoma Game has managed to break up a friendship very important to me. Its insane that such a petty conflict in such an unimportant situation can kill something that I've known so well for the past few years. Regardless, my life is so different now. I went through high school on a very tight leash with my parents and now I have no restrictions. No more "be in by one o'clock", no more "you can't spend the night out" no more "do your homework". Even though I'm supported by them primarily, I make my own decisions now. It seems a lot easier to go with the flow of things around here, do what I really want to do and not worry about what my parents think is the best decision or the right choice. School has also changed. I love my classes, my professors are wonderful, but the actual academics are a good deal harder. I went to a 0A school taking all honors classes, and everyone told me how the hard academics I was in then would make UT a breeze. Wroooong. I'm going to pull through, I'm determined. I love where I am. 
__label__label1 It is 0:00 and I have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. I can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that I am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that I will only be graded for the fact that I did it and not examined for the content of my mind. Does everyone hold their mind as sacred? I can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way I guess I am somewhat obsessive/compulsive. It's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. This openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do I have to say? This 00 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who I am sometimes I think that's what life is about  everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet I wish I had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. Who doesn't want to be analyzed? Who doesn't want to analyze? I know that I am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, "voyeurs". I had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. My friends considered themselves "voyeurs" and I had to admit that I am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions I only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. It strikes me as funny that I am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that I am talking to you to the extent that I can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? I was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. I thought again about how different I feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and I feel like I've written a lot. If I were a TA I would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as I read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and I would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. But perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are "true to science" YAY! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. I am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet I cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? It has certainly given people (I've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. I don't discount science, I do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. It's a tough tough thing. Of course 00% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous I can imagine. But as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? I have been asking a lot of questions! How defining of me! Now I (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. I will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 0 minutes actually the time will be up. Well love and life and craziness and all the things I thought I would end up saying are not surfacing here, although I think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? I think I remember once reading about oh shit I lost my train of thought oh yeah, I think it might have been PROPNAME PROPNAME (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. Those few seconds that you pause when someone says "mother" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha HA! PROPNAME time's up. This has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words I was using. Thank you very much. 
__label__label0 This assignment seemed so easy at first, but now that I am actually writing it, it is hard to find something to write about. I thought that would spend a little time telling you about my first few days at The ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I come from a very small town, and all my life I have dreamed of living in a very big city. So around my junior year in high school I began looking at different schools and one of them happen to be here. Well I have been to Austin before, but I never got to really go on campus. As I stood on the south mall and saw the capital, I knew this was the place for me. I had a big city and a big school all rolled into one. As the big day got closer and closer, I began to chicken out. I didn't want to leave home, but most of all, I didn't want to leave my family. I wasn't for sure that I could move six hours away not knowing one single person. Everyone told me that I would never make it on my own because I was too much of a "mommy's girl. " This is when I knew that it was time to grow up and take another big step in my life. The "moving day" finally arrived and I was scared, but very excited. I decided to go through rush. I needed some kind of activity to keep me busy and this was perfect. My family got me settled in and two days later they were gone. I was very surprised that I didn't shed a tear that day, and two weeks later I still haven't looked back. I haven't even been homesick yet. My roommate is having a hard time, though. We didn't get along at first, but I think everything will work out fine. She calls home a lot crying, and sometimes that is kind of hard on me, but I hope to help her through this tough time. Other than a few small bumps in my road, I am having the time of my life. I will admit all of this is a huge change for me, but sometimes change is just what a person needs. Somehow, everything has just fallen in place for me, and I hope it will remain this good for the next 0 years. 
__label__label0 I am residing at Castillian for my freshman year. I have my own personal room, which is more than I can say for others. It is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. The entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. All the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. My parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things I'd like to do. They try so hard to make me happy, but I'm not. I feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. I also believe that this was their full intention. We'll call it a bribe. They spit out money as long as I do well. This shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and I myself would like to succeed as best I can. The bribe, however, is the problem. I'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. Dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. Everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. Your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. You can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. I have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. I go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. When it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. Already after the first day of class, I have messed up terribly on homework. I am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. In fact, it actually brought me to tears. An assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. I see myself as pathetic because I failed myself and because I can crack so easily. I can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 0  0 with a one hour lunch break each day. If I had to guess, I would say that I was unsure of everything. I'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. On top of this, I'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. I'm sure it will all level out in the end and that I'll eventually get the swing of things. As of now, however, I feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. I only wish I wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in LOCNAME hadn't died last week). It only seems to complicate things. Also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. Perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. All I know is that it seems so much right now. 
__label__label1 At the present time, I am content to be writing. It's almost time to go to sleep, and this is very relaxing. I am listening to eminem on mtv. I do not like eminem. I hate to cough. I am coughing because of this stupid dorm room and some studid mold that they think is just the paint doing wierd things. I think that my throat is doing better though, the medication is kicking in finally after about 0 days of torturous soreness. I just talked to PROPNAME, he is the greates guy in the world. But i don't want him to think that I am the only girl in the world for him. I think that it is funny that a lot of girls thought are about boys. I just want to have fun this year, and not have a boyfriend. I think it is important to just meet people and have connections with each person you come in contact, but they don't have to be any thing more than at that moment. Its really late, I wish that I wouldn't put things off till the last minute. I have had such a long day, and am ready for bed. My bed feels so good. I love the fact that I am so comfortable in my dorm with my roomates. They are so great, and fun to be with. Chaps is my roommate. I think that name is kind of different, but she like it so I just call her that. I love this song by ORGNAME ORGNAME. She ironically is talking about saying goodbye to a boyfriend.  That is what I have had to do for the past year. It was incredibly hard. But I hated the way he acted when he left for college my senior year. I felt so guilty for wanting more out of my senior year than having a boyfriend 000 miles away. He wanted more, and I feel so bad. He has some self-confidence issues. I think the fact that I actually was dating him was great for the self - confidence thing. But once we separated, it just hit him so hard. We are really good friends, but I really think he still wants more. Someday, I might also, but not now. I love that the ORGNAME's symbol is the strawberry and the queen. It is so exciting. I am so excited about organizing my New Member book. I love organizing. It almost gives me some kind of high. To be totally organized, and know where everything is. I need that kind of stability in my life, because I do so much and stretch myself in so many difections. I don't know how I am going to do Sororities, get my GPA up to at least a 0. 0, and do two organizations outside of school, (which is required by ORGNAME sorority). But I perform best under pressure, so the more the merrier. I am so excited about ORGNAME ORGNAME, that is the organization that I hope to join, as my organization to have to join. PROPNAME is in LOCNAME Spirits, and I love her. She was the person that made my decision for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME so concrete in my mind. I dreamed that I was a ORGNAME the night before i found out which one picked me. I think it was a sign or something. PROPNAME means so much to me, but she is always too busy with PROPNAME PROPNAME. Today, she did give me a card with a picture of us in it saying that she is sorry she hasn't been there to hang out with me as much as she wanted to. Zeta is going to be so awesome to be a part of. I love the friends that I have made so far. I just really think that the parties that are involved are a little too numbered throughout the week, I mean they want us to get good grades, and be in all these organizations. Yet they give us all these mixers to go to to meet people which I love to do, but they are on week nights. Oh well, I just am going to have to limit my participation in them. I miss my high school friends. I haven't talk to PROPNAME in ages, and PROPNAME didn't even say goodbye before she left. I am going to have to send them an email pretty soon. The sound of the mouse and keyboard are such wierd noises. And so are the sounds that come out of the actual computer. I always have wondered what makes the little clicking noises in the computer. I mean is it gears shifting, or electrons being shot out of some kind of machine. I want to know. That is interesting. And I am glad to be done.        
__label__label0 Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea ORGNAME this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in LOCNAME, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in LOCNAME, but had to move here to LOCNAME for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, PROPNAME, is a business major at LOCNAME, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like PROPNAME and PROPNAME, which is pronounced PROPNAME, so that makes 0 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named PROPNAME, whom I have been friends with since 0th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to LOCNAME with him, and his sister PROPNAME, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in LOCNAME at the time, moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME when I was in 0th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 0-0 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 0 business majors, then PROPNAME is a Chemical Engineer also studying at LOCNAME, and he, along with me and PROPNAME, who is 00, are all freshman, and PROPNAME is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 00 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since PROPNAME and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 00 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 00 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say. 
__label__label0 I am here in LOCNAME's library. I just finished talking with my mum on line. She is back in LOCNAME. Thought she is far away from me, every time I am talking with her, I feel that we are really close to each other. It is 0pm on Monday night, but I don't really feel hungry, though when I am thinking about the lunch I brought here with me, I feel like having it. Some fruits and a corn.   Though this is the beginning of the semester, I feel like I am having a lot more to do than usual. I guess this is the difference between big unversity and a small college    There are five classes I am taking this semester. Except the markering one, the lecture are all fine to me. However, I bet the exams going to be hard. I have to work hard to get a good GPA, then get into the program I want.   The work on campus is all right. Not so fun and changlleging. Kind of boring. I am not really learning a lot from it. The good thing is that one of the bosses is nice. He makes me feel like there is someone appreciate my 0 and half hours work in the morning. I guess, people usually using new ones harder. I don't see anyone else working as hard as I do. Basically, everyone is chatting and eating. Frankly, I'd rather work instead of chatting. But just not like this. You know what I am saying? Anyway, I hope I am going to get used to it soon.   I love to cook my own food. Saving money and tast good. But i just don't have much time to do so once school starts. So basically, I bring simple food to school or just eat somewhere else.   I have lot needs to be done tonight and hopefully I will survive tomorrow.          
__label__label0      For all of my life, I have been in control; I have been so goal oreinted and focused, but now that I am finally in college, I have no idea what I am doing. I still work hard and am still focused, but I do not know what I am working towards. Eventually, I would just like to become a house wife. There is not really anything else I am interested in. Furthermore, my boyfriend of ten months and I broke up about two weeks before moving up here. At first I had the hardest time getting over him, but now I am ok. The wierd thing is, I do not miss him, but I miss what we had; I miss what the relationship brought to my life. Sometimes it really scares me because I think to myself,   What if no one else can offer me something so great as what he offered?    My roomate is my best friend, and at the moment both she and her boyfriend are here. I look at them and remember the feeling that I had two months ago and sometimes it makes me really down. I do not really understand myself because I am independent and I know how to be alone, yet at the same time I want that in my life. It's almost like a big fat contradiction. If I am so independent, then why do I want to have a guy in my life?  I don't think I'm explaining myself very well. Last night I just sat and thought for about two hours. There is so much uncertainty in what I am doing and where I am going. My peers have always looked up to me because I have always been the one that was going to make something of myself, but now I have no idea what I will be doing after graduation. I am doing this writing assignment and my roomate and her boyfriend are being loud. I don't think it would usually bother me, but I think the fact that I don't have a boyfriend anymore makes it bother me. I actually enjoy the single life, but at the same time, I miss having someone to share my thought and emotions with. I talk to my older brother a lot. He's 00 and lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME. He's a really big factor in my life, always giving me advice and helping me through the rough times. I love the relationship that he and I share because we are more than just siblings, we are really good friends. Another thing that I think about is my family. My mom and I are really close. Sometimes she really upsets and annoys me, but nevertheless we get along really well. I thought I would cry when she dropped me off, but I barely even teared. When everyone went home for labor day weekend, I stayed here in LOCNAME. I didn't want to go home. I didn't miss it yet. I always thought I would be homesick, and the fact that I am not, makes me feel sort of guilty. I miss my mom in the sense that she is my mom, but I don't feel the urge to see her, and that makes me feel guilty too. I am going home this weekend for a doctor's appointment. I think once I am home again I will be homesick. I like ORGNAME. It's wierd because college is supposed to be really stressful and I am sure that it will be, but for right now, I think college is really relaxing.  
__label__label1 I am so excited that I get to see my family this weekend. I never thought I would feel so home sick at college. I love my mother so much she has been through hell and back and still remains such a wonderful Christian mother. If I am half the mother she is to me when I have children I know I will be doing a great job. I am also really nervous about this presentation I have to do on Monday for my Media Studies class. Not only do I not know what to write about but I don't know how to prepare for it. Of course I got there late for my discussion group  so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday. But that is so my luck. It makes me think that if I am nervous about giving this in front of my discussion group of maybe twenty people how am I going to make it in the communications field which is what I am majoring in at this point. I really want to work for ORGNAME. I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy, but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue. I just love everything about music. The artists there story, the songs story, and how they make people fell. I can't wait till I am done typing this because then I get to go play PROPNAME with my roomate and a couple of our friends from back home. I am such a competitive person which to me is a good thing because it makes me have more determination then most people. I am watching Will and Grace and they are talking about having a baby. Gosh I can't wait till that day. I think I must have orange cones around me though and a flashing message that tells guys don't talk to her!  I swear they avoid me at all costs. What the heck is wrong with me. I think I might be a little intimidating because I don't play the role of a dumb girl who needs a guy to take care of her. Which I think I got that from my mother. She is a single mom, my father died when I was ten, who is a teacher and had to raise three children all by herself. She didn't need help from anyone and she never threw in the towel when times got hard. For that I respect and love her very much. God has blessed me with the best family I could have ever imaged. Not only my imidate family but everyone from my grandparents to aunts and uncles to cousins. All of them have played such an important part of my life and have thought me so much that I just want to go and hug all of them and say thanks for loving me it has given such strength. My grandparents are so great because they can always make me feel like a million bucks even when I am at my lowest. I think it is important to surround yourself with a close knit family. I don't know what I would do without mine. I am so glad I have my roomate and friends from back home here at LOCNAME. I probably won't have latest this long without them and there company. They all have such interesting stories that I had never know about them before. Most of my school went to LOCNAME a and m which is exactly like my hometown. We all just needed something different and a place with a good sports team 
__label__label0      Okay, I thought right now would be the best time to do this. I'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. This is all that keeps playing over and over right now. Where did we mess up? Well the past is the past and you can't change it. My dad came down and was very disappointed. He didn't know I had been drinknig for 0 and half years now and I don't evne get drunk. I get a buzz and I'm good. I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. For some reason he doesn't beleive it. He was furious. He's always trusted me for everything and never thought I'd mess up like this. I do good in school graduated top 0% of my class and everything. I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. So they would think of me as they saw me everyday. This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people. I'm a real easy going person. The way I think is that I don't care aobut anything. I let things happen. I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen. I like to make people happy. I'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win. If they think they are right than they feel good. As for me I don't care. I know I'm right or wrong and I let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it. I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly. I hate no one, I think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. Once someone screws me over than I don't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone. Well I guess that's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. Very bad excuse, I know. My dad thinks it's peer pressure. Peer pressure has never gotten to me I odn't think. I have a strong will about serious things. If I think it's bad and will do something to me I don't like than I won't do it. I tried weed too because I wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. I tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and I have astma so I decdie that wasn't for me. I never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. So so I decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times I liked the feeling. It was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. My mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. My mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. I would hate that. My dad I don't know. As I sit here thikngi aobut him I feel more and mroe sorry. He came yesterday and gave me a lecture and I said I wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because I couldn't be sincere I thought it was bullshit. A few drinks every now and then can't hurt. Well I know it can but still it's weird I don't know how to explain. Well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. Me and my dad rarely talk I talk to my mom aobut my problems, so I got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if I was still going to dirnk and if I had done any other drugs. He doesn't trust me me anymore. That hurts the worst. I'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because I l;iek to think things thorugh. Right now I feel very guilty. I totally blew my dad off this afternoon and I saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. I guess I get it from him. It's weird. So now I'mthinkngi aobut how I can make it up. I got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. We tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. But somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. My dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. She said I sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. For some reason I still lsiten ot her so I'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that I'm going to stop drinknig. I really do want to stop now.

__label__label1    Yes, I'm finally in college. It feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and I'm finally here. It feels good to go home every now and then because I feel important. Just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. The smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times I've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. There is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. I'm feeling really good about my classes and I'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. I can't wait until the weekend comes because the music I'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. I'm glad I'm in college because I here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.     
__label__label0      I am feeling a little worried right now about my classes and how well I'll do on the tests and other assignments. I'm used to the class settings now but it's still a little strange to me to be in a class with 000 or more students. I wonder how I'll do in my biology and chemistry classes next semester because I've already heard how difficult it is. I'm stressed out with college work due to the daily reading assignments and I have to take notes over the material for my future exams. I wish I was a senior so I can get out of this place and not have to study ever again! I miss home and I wish I could go visit sometime soon. But of course I can't because I have tests and other things coming up. I can't wait until Thanksgiving so I can go home and relax with my family and friends. I wish I knew more people here or at least have some close friends. I haven't been able to start a conversation with anyone in my class. It's probably because I'm shy and afraid to go up to a stranger and just casually start a conversation. I really do miss my high school friends and I just wish I was back in high school. It was so much easier and more fun. Oh well. . everyone said college is going to be the most fun and memorable part of your life. After attending the Tuesday night bible study, I felt really happy and greatful that I got to meet such nice and open-hearted people. The praise was great and I liked the prayer time too. I haven't prayed to God recently and it gave me the opportunity to communicate with him again. But I felt guilty because I don't pray to God like everyone else on a regular basis. It seems as though I only pray to God when I need help or feeling worried and sad. I should continually pray to him from now on because it's important that I establish an existing relationship with him. I'm glad tomorrow is Friday! Yay!! I only have 0 section tomorrow and then I'm free until Monday. Hopefully I'll have a fun weekend unlike last week when I just stayed in my dorm and study. 
__label__label0 This morning I went to class at 0:00AM. I was really tired so I guess I should have gone to bed earlier than I did, but I was having fun with my neighbors. After my 0:00 class, I had two more classes, but now I'm done for the day. I was so hungry when I got back at noon that I had to go eat right away in the cafeteria. Now I'm trying to do some of my homework because I have a lot to read. College is more demanding than high school. I never had to read a lot in high school, but now it seems that all of my classes require me to read 0 chapters a week. It's very hard to keep up with. And it's distracting in the dorm because something's always going on that you want to participate in. but when you have so much to do you have to set your priorities. My roommate just came back from class a few minutes ago. Her schedule is very different than mine. She went to the roof to sunbathe and then came back to the room. I really don't want to study. I'd rather watch Fear Factor that I taped last night. I was eating dinner at 0pm yesterday and therefore had to tape it instead of just watch it. I am going home this weekend to see my boyfriend. And then on Sunday I might be going to a waterpark with some of my new friends here. They are nice people. There are quite a few people here from my high school in LOCNAME, but not many people that I was friends with. One of my friends, PROPNAME, is here and actually lives in the same dorm as me. She lives on the 00 floor though. I live on the 00th. It's really hard to get an elevator from this high up in the building. Sometimes I have to wait almost 0 whole minutes for one. That is especially annoying when you are on your way to class. This morning I was almost late for my economics class because I went to breakfast with my neighbors. I wasn't really hungry but I had a yogurt and some orange juice. Then I felt kind of sick. I made it to economics, but just barely before the teacher started class. My economics class is all the way over in Jester, and I live in LOCNAME, so it's annoying to walk all that way. Especially at 0AM. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't start until noon though, which is really nice. On sunday I didnt wake up until 0:00pm. That is the longest I have ever slept in. Tuesday and Thursday I have 0AM classes, but that was because I had no choice. I went to the 0th orientation, so I didnt have much left to pick from. One of my neighbors is from LOCNAME like me. Except he's from LOCNAME, which is where my boyfriend's dad lives. I like it out there, because there are lots of trees. Maybe one day I will have a house there. I hope to have 0 kids when I grow up. at least 0. I am an only child and hate it, so I don't want my kids to have to be only children. Our power just went out in our dorm room, but only in one of the switches. It happened before and my roommate and I were in darkness for days, until someone came and switched the breaker. We know what to do now, so we flipped the breaker switch and the plug started working again. When I started this writing assignment I thought 00 minutes would be a short amount of time. but now it feels neverending. I'm glad I don't have any more classes today because i'm tired. Two of my neighbors are from the Greek island of Cypress. Their acents are really cool. One of them, PROPNAME, is celebrating his 00th b-day tomorrow, so we are all going to take him out to dinner. I don't know of any cool restaurants in LOCNAME, since I have only been here a couple of weeks. I'm sure we'll find a nice place though. The two Greek guys actually met on the plane ride over here from LOCNAME, and decided to be roommates. They are nice people. One of the book I bought for my Freshman Seminar class is not right, so i need to take it back. I'm glad they give us a good amount of time to return things, becaue it would be unfair if I had bought the book and just had to swallow the cost. Speaking of that, my neighbors and I went to the store the other day and I bought milk. When i got back to the room, i noticed that it didnt taste right. The expiration date isnt until September 00th, but for some reason the milk was bad. So i'm going to have to throw it away. I need to go to ORGNAME and get some groceries soon. I need to buy milk, gatorade, chips, etc. I sometimes get hungry at night in my room and the cafeteria is closed. Today in the cafeteria they don't have any vanilla ice cream. I'm disappointed because that is my favorite one they have. They also have strawberry which is disgusting, and chocolate which i havent had yet. Maybe it's good. I want to find a mall close to here so that i can go shopping. I don't know where many stores are. I did find a target however. That is my favorite store. The other day 
__label__label1      Well here i sit at college and Its kind of weird. IN the next room there is music playing which I like. It makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that I went to. It was in good ole LOCNAME, and I was Occumpanied by my cousin. Now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending ORGNAME ORGNAME. She now lives in LOCNAME, what a tough life. My room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. I always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. Actually it is quite organized. I have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as I have grown older I have realized that indeed I do enjoy some sense of organization. My roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that I have. Coming from LOCNAME, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from LOCNAME. A friend away from home you could say. My connection in the bussiness. . haha, I didnt always live there though, I came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. Im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but I do remember that it was right before I entered High school and it was still a major adjustment. I went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. My high school that is. Now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. That is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than I could have imagined on that friday night. Nothing could go right. I miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. You never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. I have not written much lately, and I know that I should have been writing every day. I once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. That and reading, but I know that I will have no shortage of reading this year. I have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. I enjoy reading. I guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. When your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. You think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. Somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. Inspire or say something meaningful. Its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. With so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. You can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. You have to find the median. The happy place you could say. Not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. You can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. You have to make it happen. As clich'e as it sounds, its true. In the words of PROPNAME PROPNAME and the Stones,   You can't always get what you want. .   You could say that they truly are wise old men. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. Amen brother. Spoken by a true poet. I have always liked comedy in my writing. Not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. I mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. If they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. It was a wasted tree. Often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. I by no means claim to be a great writer nor do I claim to make people laugh, I am simply claiming that I like to laugh as I read. I enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. If it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. It is a shame that I do not write as much as I used to. The Ideas are there, I just have not gotten them out yet. They will be there, it will just take time. I guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. My memory is not the greatest right now, at 00 years old. When I hit seventy or beyond, I can't wait until I have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. . 
__label__label0      I'm sitting here thinking about what in the world my friends behind me are talking about, it's pretty funny. we just got finished eating at taco bell, which at the time sounded like a good idea, but i'm now seriously regretting that choice. My friend is quizzing me about what I am typing and it's really messing me up, she can be so obtrusive sometimes. I can't complain though, because I came here to use her computer so I could print off something, so I should be thankful, right? Oh yeah, I'm using proper grammar, hope that wasn't part of the assignment. I just thought about how long twenty minutes is. This assignment could never end. My friend didn't go to class yesterday, so her and her roommate are talking about this, who knew something so goofy could be talked about for five minutes, but who am I to judge, because I do the same thing. PROPNAME is trying to explain what happened on All My Children to me, not taking into account I am trying to do homework, but the bad thing i actually want to know. I don't feel good, so if this paper is a little weird take into account I am probably delusional from sickness and maybe fever. My nose is running, my throat hurts. Okay now my friend is saying she would have beat me in grade point in high school if she has worked on. she has been saying this for three freaking year, what is the statute of limitations on dwelling?  Oh my God, my nose will not quit running, that makes it very hard to type. You ever realize when you are told to write what you think, the pressure makes it impossible to keep your thoughts on logical things. So instead I just keep thinking how,   I don't know what I'm going to write about  . Now my friends are talking about this show called the rerun show, where they make fun of old shows, this one being saved by the bell. I used to love that show, i can even remember most of the episodes. We are so retarded, I can't believe we are actually talking about this. Remarkably, this conversation has been going on for eight minutes. I actually kept tabs on the little timer thing. PROPNAME has hairy legs, she keeps annoucing it to everyone, who cares. Although, it is kind of gross because she is wearing shorts. Nobody is talking behind me now so once again my thoughts are on the paper and I am drawing a total blank. When this happens I tend to get nervous and my typing gets extremely bad, so I am having to delete alot. Now my friends are watching me and that makes me even more nervous. Oh I bet this makes for an exiting paper for someone to read, the ranting and raving of a sick, saved by the bell loving freak. Something horribly embarrassing happened to me today, I was telling my friend about how my professor says the word LOCNAME weird, guess who was behind me. the professor no less, I am not sure i will ever fully recover from that. 
__label__label1     Its hard to start anywhere I guess I feel like I'm being analyzed   for what I'm writing, but I know that it doesnt mean anything, that   twenty minutes of writing can't really say everything about me. class   somewhat worries me, I know I've taken 0 some odd AP classes yet   i still don't feel like i'm prepared, i just have to stay focused, i hope   that doesnt bother taylor to much but he's just going to have to learn   that it takes me a while to study and that has to come first. Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems. The worst battles are those that come out of ignorance,   and people learn how to float the system of books and test, but it   would be harder to ignore real human interaction, there seems to be   so much misunderstanding in the world simply because people   don't interact and learn who's really out there, so much of humanitys   misery could be qualmed if only people spent time physically   interacting with humanity. Its easier to disregard a text than it is to   disregard a human. but i suppose not very many people see it that   way. I wonder if this is where im supposed to be or if there is some   greater plan out there for me, i wish i knew, but i guess thats life, the   suprise of the future, the unknow of the big picture, everyone goes   through it I suppose i just have to as well. I'm tired of pouring out my   thoughts to a page, i want to talk to people, people who think like   me, i think PROPNAME PROPNAME is the most amazing person ever, her   attitude toward people is superfluous with love. she just is the most   beautifully person inside and out, she is a role model for the way to   look and society and people, i hope to gain a lot of the knowledge   that she has. I'll just keep reading her books, i need to check out the   library and see what else they have, too bad i never have time to   read what i want to and what really enhances my life because im   stuck reading textbooks for hours. I hope i get to join the crew team it   will be really exciting if im actually around athletic people, maybe it   will get me off my butt, lord knows i need to. oh well, 00 minutes   done, gosh that flew by, it was a nice writing assignment, i wish we   could have more like that. This   open your door    thing next week is   going to fabulous im exciting about people stopping by and meeting   everyone on our floor. i swear that the strangest thing, its the second   time I've switched the words our and hour, and not in the same way   either, very odd. tonights going to fun watching the football game, i   hope taylor enjoys himself tonight, it makes me so mad when hes   upset about social surroundings, oh well he'll learn. i guess i have   to get ready soon to go watch the game, i seem to always be   running behind, i'll catch up soon enough, i hope my package from   apple computer comes soon, im excited about my new adaptor silly   really to get excited but what the hey, might as well enjoy life

__label__label0 PROPNAME started Instant Messenging me randomly a few days ago. He wouldn't tell me who he is. At first, I did't have a problem with not knowing who he was, because the mystery is exhilirating. But after a while, he started to talk like PROPNAME. He even knew about PROPNAME's death. I loved PROPNAME. That night, I dreamed about PROPNAME, but in my dream, Anyagreene was PROPNAME. I was so happy to see PROPNAME. I was glad that PROPNAME cared enough to IM me despite his heartless character and heavy workload. When I woke up, I wanted to fall back to sleep. . I wanted to fall back into the world where PROPNAME still cared about me. It's also a world where PROPNAME was still alive. He was alive through this Screenname. PROPNAME and PROPNAME were the same character in that dream, or at least that's what I thought. I often dream about PROPNAME, thinking that he's still alive, only to wake up crying in the middle of the night because in reality, PROPNAME hasn't been in this world for a while. After talking to my roommate last night, I realized why I loved PROPNAME so much. PROPNAME was unattainable, just like Mr. Big from Sex and the City. It was exactly his unattainability that attracted me. I thought PROPNAME was my soul mate last year. I've never had that kind of of connection with anyone else in my life. To say the least, I don't think I'd ever be able to forget Jeff. I hope we'll be able to go to the same graduate school together. I believe in soul mates. I don't think all soul mates are fortunately enough to end up with each other for the rest of their lives, but they do exist. Mine is probably jeff, but due to his bisexual tendencies and his lack of willingness to commit, it didn't work out. How sad it is to thikn that I've met my soul mate when I was sixteen and I missed my one and only chance? My mother's soul mate is not my father. THey love each other, but there's this other man that was my mother's best friend and first love. He had such a great impact on her life. Just like the way Rusell changed my life. But I think in a way, besides the period of depression, PROPNAME changed my life for good. After dating him, I got into PROPNAME's Rock, and now I'm a 00 year old sophomore in college. I saw him again this summer and it was hard not to patronize him because of how pathetic he looked. PROPNAME and I showed up in his house when he was selling all of his worldly posessions so he could go away with the girl in the picture who's passed out. I admire his passion, but I would never do something like that. Like I've always said before, the reason that he did that was beacuse he could. He has the ability to turn his world upside down and still come on top. . or at least that what I think. Back to jeff. . I miss him. but I think transfering to LOCNAME was the right decision. I could nto have accomplished anythign with him in the same school as me. I am only productive when I am single and not distracted by boys. I should think about boys less in general. What are the chances of any one of them doing any good to my life? I would much rather listen to   play that funky music white boy   on my computer, write in this as an effort to be   productive   and go to ORGNAME when I'm done with this. Speaking of ORGNAME, i really need to finish doing my organic chemistry reading, homework. . review/preview genetics and get some physics done today. I guess I can do other stuff tomorrow. I don't have a whole lot oftime left though. I haven't been productive in a LONG time. I am worried that I won't be able to do what i want to do since I've been so lazy lately. Maybe my brain is rusty. but I still have faith in myself. I think i WILl be able to finish these things. I'm goign to ball room dance tomorrow night. That should be fun. I hope I won't be a wall flower. I need to work out too. I am tired of looking like a loaf of bread. I don't enjoy looking at the fat on my legs. but it's not like I can't change that with an hour inthe gym everyday. It just takes some effort. I need to make some changes in my life, but the good thing with being human is our abiilty and capability to change. 
__label__label0      I'm tired but i want to go to sleep. im listening to music that i really like its new but i like it i like country and this isnt country music does something to me i can't explain it it gives me a feeling i can't decide what to do this weekend i really like to drink sweet tea in a nalgene i found it camp i like it there this weekend i can go camping but i don't know if i should go she talks to angels i want to stay in austin and hang out with some friends and i don't want to leave but i think i should go my roommates are gone eating they like to do fraternity stuff im not in a fraternity im not really the type for a frat but i think it would be good for me but i don't agree with some of the stuff that they do i can't really do a fraternity thats how it is im excited about next week i really like friends i like to spend time with people especially people i am close to i really like to just hang out with the guys i got so much sleep the other day and it was great  im not tired today and i only slept four hours i don't want to do homework i fear growing up and going to work every day all i want to do is play golf and have a good time listen to music and not worry about responsibility but i don't think that can happen its not real i wish it could happen but it can't but life would be very boring if i did that so in a way i guess its good that i can't do that i like listening to really random music music that no one listens to i try to get people to get to listen to the music i listen to but they don't like it it frustrates me because i think i listen to good music a lot of the people are hypocrites they talk about how christian they are but they are not its almost a lie but who am i to judge i am wrong for that i don't like to eat the food it towers but i have to because i don't have enough money i wish i did though i really like to eat good food that is one of the only nice things that i like my shorts came in today and they were wrong i exchanged them it frustrated me i really want to play golf i havent played in a while and i want to play i want to get good really good i want to go back to camp it is fun there that is where many of my friends are from my room is messy and i need to clean it up but im just too lazy what am i going to do about this weekend i need to call austin i need to figure out who i am going to hang out with in college i need to find my group of friends i think that i have my group but i don't know if it is right for me i like this song it does something for me something intangible something awesome i can't explain it but it rules my high school friends did frats but i am the only one who didnt i wonder what that means i guess that i am different i know why but i  wonder if they do they don't seem to understand my ways i different and i wish everyone would understand it but i don't know what to do i wish everyone could just figure it out we are all the same and different i don't like my schedule it sucks straight up i hate the smell of towers but i love sweet tea and golf making tea is awesome it gives me something to do and i like making it for other people i would like others to think that i am a good guy i don't know if that is good or bad i think i should be nice just for being nice but i want people to think that i am a nice guy i can't help it its just the way that i am and i guess that we all are I sometimes think that i like movie soundtracks they are good i like sweet tea its good my roommate doesnt like my music i like to play guitar its good ill brave  your heart swiss watch bagpipes things like that nalgene bottle music rocks i need a new car  but i don't know if i will get one whistling to music a texas hat and abercrombie shirt a chief perhaps my roommant tank he is gay according to my roommate i overuse that word chief but its a good word my roommate is acting like a chief he calls me a chief for calling people chiefs bob dylan rules but  myy roommate is a chief for not liking him i want to play guitar but it is out of tune 
__label__label1      I was so excited about coming to UT and I still am but alot of things just over whelm me. For example, people in LOCNAME are not a friendly as college students at other schools. Basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes. What it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. I nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 0. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. That really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. I know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. One thing that i don't like about living in LOCNAME is that it is so expensive to live here. Every place on campus is between 000 and 000 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. I really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. One more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. But i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. I wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. That is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. And now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. For example, in LOCNAME she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to ORGNAME i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. My goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. I can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams. 
__label__label0      Well i just got back from LOCNAME, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though LOCNAME isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 00 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from LOCNAME. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. PROPNAME, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get ORGNAME here my mom taped the last 0 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no ORGNAME! Hopefully PROPNAME gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 00 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. 
__label__label1      Right now I am listening to a great song. It is a song by PROPNAME PROPNAME called HUrrincane. I really like and it is a true story. PROPNAME PROPNAME is probably my favorite artist of all time. He is an amazing songwriter. And i love how he can play harmonica and guitar at the same time. I realize other people can probably do this but I just love to listen to PROPNAME PROPNAME. In this song Hurricane he tells the story of a boxer named PROPNAME PROPNAME who is framed for a crime he did not commit. His lyrics are really great because he plays with his rhyming and his rythm changes a lot too. I have seen PROPNAME PROPNAME perform in three different cities. The best one was in LOCNAME. I think LOCNAME is just a great city in general. That is one of the main reasons I wanted to go to ORGNAME. I really liked the idea of living in LOCNAME. And now that I am here it is working out really well. The school is huge but it is a very friendly, very beautiful campus. I am always surprised by how many people I run into in the course of a day. Sometimes I hadnt even known that the person went to Ut or even that they were in LOCNAME. Yesterday when I was eating I saw a guy that I had no seen since eighth grade. He recognized me right away and said his name so that I would remember him. It was amazing that he recognized me froms so long ago. I thought that was really cool. And I love UT because there are so many interesting classes to take. I never thought I would be able to take a whole class devoted to classical mythology. I have learned a little about mythology in other classes but now I have a whole class for it. It is really fun to read about all the deities and gods and demigods in different types of myths. My roommate right now has a sociology class about juvenile delinquency. I think that is also very interesting. She is reading her textbook right now. My roommate is cool. I got very lucky with the pot luck assignment. Shes from LOCNAME LOCNAME and her mom is a judge. Yesterday I met her mom and she is very nice too. She took us out to a really great Chinese restaraunt. It was one of my first non Jester meals since I've been here. I don't mind the food at Jester. Some people complain that Jester is gross but I really like it. The people on my floor are very friendly. Two girls across the hall always come over and hang out with us and its a lot of fun. I have lots of distractions from studying though so I have to be sure to try and concentrate and actually get my work done. There is just so much to do here. Tonight I am probably going to go to hear a singer play named PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is playing at LOCNAME. I have never been there but my brother tells me that it is cool. It is fun having an older brother go to the same school as you. He looks out for me. I sat with him at the footbasll gamme and it was really fun. I even got to go out on the field during halftime to help form the tunnel for the players. My very first UT game was a big success. The second half was very uneventful but overall I had a really good time. I don't usually watch a lot of football but I am excited about going to support the UT team. I even watched a girls soccer game the day after that. We beat ORGNAME 0-0. It was pretty fun to watch. I love to play soccer but I have not been on an organized team since my freshman year. In high school I mainly played softball. But now that I am at UT I don't play that anymore. I am going to sign up for intra mural volleyball and possibly flag football. My roommate and I are going to try to be on the same team. It should be a lot of fun. It is coed so we got some guys to join our team from down the hall. When I was in eighth grade I played volleyball and I was a setter. I think that will be my job on this team as well. My favorite sport to watch is baseball. I like to follow the ORGNAME ORGNAME. My dad is a big fan so he has had season tickets to the ORGNAME games for years. Now that there is a new stadium, our seats are really good. We sit right behind home plate and it is a great view of the game. Last time I watched one the ORGNAME won. They have changed a lot of stuff about ORGNAME baseball. They used to have cool rainbow uniforms and an alien guy for a mascot. But now the colors are navy blue and red or something like that. ANd the mascot is just some bunny thing. I like the old, vintage uniforms better. I wish I still had my old ORGNAME tshirts because it is very hard to find that stuff now. I had a big poster of Orbit the old mascot. 
__label__label1      I don't understand many of the girls on my hall. They are all so immature and obnoxious. I want to meet mew people but I have a hard time giving any of these girls a real chance. I miss my little sisters and worry about them. My mother worries a lot about all of the things they may get into that are bad for them. I kind of screwed things up for them. I shouldn't have gotten into so much trouble in high school. It was fun though. I am so far away from anything I am familiar with. I have been away from home many times and it does not bother me. I did not realize being in school would disruot my comfort zone in the way that it has. I want to experience Austin but have no on to experience it with and am afraid to go out alone, especially at night. I feel full and I love ice cream. I am very tierd for no reason at all. I am worried that I will not be able to find some really good friends. I am excited. I got a really good wristband for the OU game. Hell yeah!!!  I went to dinner with one of my neighbors tonight and I just know everything she said to me was a total crock of shit. I don't understand why people lie like that, maybe she is an obssessive compulsive liar. I hate computers, I hate how the entire system of life is now dominated by them. They are just machines, not people. American's are so detatched. September eleventh is tomorrow. The last stream of conciousness I did was about PROPNAME PROPNAME and Peeps. I love Peeps. Why do they only make them at Easter. Just like egg nog at Christmas. You can only have egg nog at Christmas though. It's like an overload of egg nog if you have a lot of it. Moderation is important. My roomie is nothing like me. How in the hell did we end up living together. It's because my mom altered my questionaire. The lack of freedom!!!!!  I think it is awful that they put animals into zoos. That should be illegal. They could have rehab clinics for the ones that they rescue but they shouldnt make their mony off of people coming in to look at them. I talked to a guy that was a Comp something or other major and when I asked him what that was he said he didn't know!!  How can you not know what your major is???  That is just wrong. I think he was just messing with me. I went to ground zero, it really impacted me in a different way. I never know if I am ding stream of conciousness writing the right way. There is no right way though. I HATE COMPUTERS. Typing was invented by the devil. The home keys???  I just hate them. Music is so important to us. I wish I had a larger vocabulary. Why do people use people?  I only have a little bit left. When I work out only 00 seconds or a single repetition can last forever. I guess I'm feelin' alright. It's all going to be good in the end. 
__label__label0  How necessary is sleep? The past few days, I have been going to morning swim practice and then my 0 A. M. classes. Is only four to five hours enough? I know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. But is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. Right now I am feeling somewhat tired, but know that I have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. Will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will I get use to this kind of sleep cycle.      Also I wonder if I am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. Are my notes as good as they should be or should I be taking more during class? I write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do I need more details in order to do well.      The past few days I have recieved two different parking tickets, that I thought were unnecessary. I double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. The signs indicated that I wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if I could find a spot. But after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, I guess I now have to pick a different location. I wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. I wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. The front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. This is mainly because of the lack of evidence that I have, which I think is incredibly stupid.    
__label__label1 i feel really weird HAVING to write something. Pressure?  Yeah. My   dormmates   are so loud. I can hear the tv blaring through the door right now. They woke me up this morning (on several accounts. )  I have to get used to this (or they have to SHLOCNAME UP! :) )  my dad called right as I started this. I would really like to talk to him, but I turned my phone ORGNAMEf. Hopefully I can get through to him after I finish with this. I'm a really fast typer, this thing will probably be really long. Maybe I should slow it down some. I was really suprised that my dad called. I thought that I sent him a pretty nasty e-mail last night about paying for my books (i'm really just mad at him because he hasn't made the effort to come up and see me yet. )  but he sent me back another e-mail saying that he would give me the check for my books tomorrow. when he came up for lunch. Damn!  I hate it when he does that too me. Just when he fits the perfect category of a bastard father and I have a legitimate reason for hating him he pulls some shit like this. Also, looking back at my e-mail it wasn't nasty at all. Why can't I just tell him how I feel. It's a shame that no one in the Psych department is going to read this, because I'm sure that one could do some serious psycho-analysis on the way I feel about my father. I would really love to do research on girls from families where the father   abandoned   the family. See how they turned out in their romantic/sexual relationships, how they relate to other men. I know that I would probably be the perfect sterotypical   i don't have a daddy   girl. Insatiable sexual appetite, emotional codependency, needing to constantly be reassured that the ones I love most won't leave me. It makes me really sad what my dad has done to me. I don't think it's ever really angered me (i don't know that I've actually ever been REALLY angry at anything), but it makes me almost stiff with sadness. My roomate just walked in totally throwing my stream of consciousness off, but I think I was probably done with that thought anyway. I don't know what I'm going to do with my college education. There's just so much that I could see myself being really happy doing. I would love to go into print journalism (write for a newspaper or a magazine), psychology (what I talked about earlier), teaching (i don't know why. i just love kids and i feel that i'm a really good teacher), then there's politics. I could really see myself getting into a campaign. BUt last night I had a dream, so real that earlier today I couldn't remember whether it had really been a dream that I just HAD to get into the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I wonder if that holds any weight to what I really want to do. HOw logical does it sound to make a career descision on a dream?  Some might say that it's very logical, like PROPNAME. I love her so much. I remember when I was a freshman in high school and brainwashed by ORGNAME, and we would get into these huge religious debates. Now I think that there may be more truth to what she thinks than what I believed. I miss her and LOCNAME so much that it hurts. I'm cryng now just thinking about it. After the divorce, we became a unit. NOw I can't help but feel that that unit is slowing crumbling. I miss how LOCNAME would always make me laugh. He's so goofy. I remember when football was on he would pile up thed cushions from the sofa and dive into them. I feel like a little piece of me has died, even though he's only 0 0/0 hours away. Who is this close to their brother?  But, Mom was never home and for the past 0 years I've kind of raised him. I remember when he and I would commisserate about how much he and I hated PROPNAME. I feel realy bad for not being able to get ahold of her before I left. I guess I probably could have tried harder. That's my problem. I get so close to being a good person, or being a sociable person as is the case at school, but I never follow through with what I say I will. I wonder if that has anything to do with Dad never doing the same thing?  I am so excited about American Idol coming on tonight. LEss than 0 hours. I really hope that PROPNAME winds. I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm not really sure that she wants me as her bridesmaid, or if she's just doing it because PROPNAME asked PROPNAME to be his groomsman. When I call them she never seems to want to talk to me. Oh well, she asked me and there's nothing that she can do about it now. Well, I guess there is. I want to get married. To PROPNAME. And I want to raise a family. I want a dog. I want to be happy. I want to watch our 0 kids grow up and have kids of their own. I would really love to be in LOCNAME with him right now. I wish that I could life the UT campus and set it back down in LOCNAME. I mean, I love UT but I hate having to be so far from PROPNAME. It was really fun this weekend staying with him. I do feel really bad about giving that guy my number. he called last night and he talks as if he was really slow. oh well. i know i won't follow up on it. and why would i?  i'm in a very serious, very committed relationship. and i love richard very very much. i really believe that he is my soulmate

__label__label1      000, I never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, Im supposed to be typing instead ORGNAME talking to PROPNAME. Man, this song is so melodic and soothing. It reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. Well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. Sometimes I wonder why people are the way they are. It's quite complex and difficult, but I'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. I truly believe thORGNAME social qualities mean a lot. People need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this  PROPNAME. The song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, Tool. Music, is a language everyone can speak. You can't go wrong with music. It's a huge part of my life. wow, PROPNAME ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. Aenima is an interesting song about Armageddon. Speaking of Armageddon, is God going to come to LOCNAME, or PROPNAME for that matter. Biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. And for what?  To not sin and go to heaven?  There are so many religions out there, I mean, controversy is going to be a given. Why is PROPNAME reading this. Is he interested in what is on my mind. Well anyway, Respect for other's religions is something I find extremely important and essential to understand at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. Instead of looking at a muslim and saying   holy shit what's up with that   just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. Live, and let live. Have respect. I feel as though people close to me in my home in LOCNAME do not realize the respect I have for them. They never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 0 sec please. Alright some middle time ORGNAME, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. They are one of my favorite punk bands. Sometimes I wonder what the lives of PROPNAME PROPNAME and Afi are like. They seem as though they are really nice people. Having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. Yeah PROPNAME PROPNAME, a legend. Now thats good stuff. I mean who doesnt like PROPNAME PROPNAME?  His music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. You just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. Not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. LOCNAME soldier in a war for LOCNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. Who dies from cannibus?  Is it really that bad?  Should we legalize it? LOCNAME's police force seems more concerned with other crimes than Marijuana. Personally,  I believe marijuana is better  
__label__label1      oh my gosh, my body hrts so bad. every time i move its like my muscles are tearing, crying out for me to stop. man, im hungry too. can't wait for kaye to get done with her class so we can go eat. i don't know how much good that is cause i don't like the food in the cafeteria anyway. oh well. the sun is so bright today- wlking around campus was really hot, but when there was a breeze, it was definitely nice. i saw some really cute squirrels out by the water fountain, and i wish i could have stopped to watch them, but i had to get to class on time. man, try outs are so hard. i don't kow if i can keep up with teveryone else for the next few weeks. it will be hard. especially now, until we get to start rowing. then i know i can show people up and do my best. classes are getting harder. there is always reading, reading, reading. it nevere ends. some of it i love while some of it drags so much when i try to read it. math is surprisingly understandable, so i feel confidnet that i will do well in that class. oh, im nervous about tryouts. i bet kate won't continue with them, she seemed to not be doing as well last night with the body circuits. i will push her a lot today at practice. mabey that will motivate her to keep working hard. so hungry!  only 0 hor until i can eat. i miss emma, more than everyone else in my family. she is always so funny, and cute. i know she is doing well in her school but i want to be there to see her and talk to her about it. can't wait to go home and see everyone. my parents seem so happy about me rowing. this reminds them of crosscountry. i miss anne and hallie too. everything beautiful is far away. the yellow flowers stephanie gave me are beautiful. i love them so much. my room feels more homey now, and yellow brightens it up a lot. i don't know what to do about simon. he frustrates me a lot, wether i show it or not. guess ill just try not to think bout it for awhile, and see what happens. no use in thinkng about it, it only makes me upset. matisse's art work is so beautiful. . i can't wait til we talk about him in art history. the figures he cuts out catch my attention so much. why did ross call last night so late. woke me up, couldnt go back to sleep. ended up oversleeping for 0 am class. but test went ok, glad i studies yesterday and did not wait until this morning to tackle the job. would have regretted that a lot, and done poorly on the test. i want to find some new music to listen to. something that is not mellow, omething with energy. ohhhh. im so sore it hurts to type. my family looks so happy in this picture. awwww. everyone is smiling so genuinely, its not one of those posed pics where everyone is forcinf a smile, ot just smiling for the sake of the camera. only one more class left today. and then its the weekend. will be nice to relax. have to get through running tonight, but i don't mind that, kind of looking forward o it. get to see the boats for the first time too. i hope kates mom is doing ok, i havent seen her in so long. i should tell my mom to go visit her, they gt along well. i like it when our renst hang out together, esp our dads. joey is so funny. i didnt realize how great of a person i had right under my nose for so long until he left. i hope he comes home from germany and doesnt like it too much out there, even though that is selfish to think. we all miss him too much- his upbeat personality and sincerity towards life. hope he comes home for christmas, or sometime soon. this weekend is goign to be busy, i should make a to do list so i can get all my homework done. the week days are so busy its hard to get everything done by the dead lines. i hope my mom sends me a letter from emma soon. she said she made me someting last tie i talked to her on the phone. my dorm is annoying me again, they want everyone to be so involved with everyone else, going to movies together, and eating dinner together all the time. i don't like it at all. i think i can only really push myself to be social and meet new people for the imes that i am out on campus. and when i come home to my dorm, i want to be by myself, not cnstantly hanging out with other people. i feel bad to an extent, because i know the ras put a lot of time into organizing that kind of stuff. but that is just not sometihg i am interested. 0 hours until practice time again. ohhhh. but then i have the whole weekend to relax. 
__label__label1 Ok. I don't like to write, but I guess this isn't really writing. there is a hair stuck between the keys. Ans I can't get it out. it is bothering me. Why are my dogs barking?  Maybe my sister is home from school. I don't know what to write. My nose itches. I am hungary. I want to go to chilli's, but I don't kow if I can. I am so bad at typing. Man, I wish that I had my computer. I can't beleive that no one was here when it came. I better get it by this weekend. ok, i guess my sister isn't here. Then why were my dogs barking?  When is she going to be home?  She should be here by now?  What time is it?  Ya, she should be here. PROPNAME's sister is home allready. Is thst how you spell allready?, or do you spell it   already   with one l?  ah, it hasn't even been 00 minutes left. I think that I burnt my tongue on that kolache. It wa sgood though. I want that other piece of it. I miss my little kids from la petite. I wander if I should get a job there on just fridays. But, I don't know if I will have time to work and get all of my studying done. Probibly not, because I am already a little behind on my reading. I hate Chemistry. I really dread going to that class. I don't understan it at all. It's like the profesor just skips over the basics. How am I suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school. I should have goe to that help session thing. well, it would have helped if I knew where it was. I wander what PROPNAME is doing. Hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here. well, I know he isn't because he would have called me. Did he take PROPNAME out to PROPNAME with him?  bla bla bla. Where is PROPNAME?  I am getting worried, I should call mom. Maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus. I hope she is ok. I need to call my mom. I really want shrimp pasta stuff. That would be really good. I need to read. I have so much reading to do for biology. I don't want to take Amber to her school. What a pain in the but, I am never going to be able to finish reading tonight. I don't have time. 
__label__label0 I am sitting in my dorm room right now and I just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because I don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on TV. I was so stressed out earlier today because I can not hack it in my calc. class. I went to class though only to affirm what I had previously believed. YEAH RIGHT. I used to think I was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that I am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. Simply for the fact that math is required. I am actually happier though because now I have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. I like that. I like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. I am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. I also added RTF 000 to my schedule. I am so excited for it. People annoy the crap out of me. Sometimes I wish I could just crawl into a box and never come out. Call me a crab but I don't really care. I am what I am. I feel chubby right now. I want to eat but then I don't. I know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when I don't truly want it. Wasters never want. . . good quote. Very true. I have come so far in my life. I can't believe I am finally at college. . on my own. There are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways I am lucky. It is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. That is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. Falling short of the glory of God. It is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. I lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and I also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! I will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. I can't believe I used to sell knives this summer. Seems like 0 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. One day, I hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. I would pay good money for that. I am sure every woman in the U. S. would do the same. I bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. I tan too often but I do like the feeling and I am not going to stop. 
__label__label1      Well, I'm in my dorm room right now and I just finished playing a computer game called WarCraft 0. It's a very addicting game and I think I play it too much. I should be doing more important stuff like studying, or I could read a book or something like that. I'm feeling pretty happy because today I really don't have any more classes to go to, but I know I have homework to do. I also have to go reset my business passwordfor my email account at the Millenium Lab. Even though I'm feeling fine right now, overall I feel pretty overwhelmed with me in college and all. I also have other stuff on my mind which worries me. Stuff that deals with my family and friends. I think I left a lot of loose ends back home in LOCNAME. I really want to tie up those loose ends though. That's one thing about me I like; I may not finish doing something or procrastinate a lot, but I always end up finishing a job, which I think is very important. If you start something you have to finish it or at least that's how I feel. I'm listening to music on ORGNAME now and I love listening to music. I would'nt feel comfortable if there was not some kind of noise happening in here. I don't like it when it's silent for some reason. I prefer when the TV is on, or someone is talking to me. For some people, relaxing means laying down in silence. For me, it's listening to my favorite songs. And I like all kinds of songs. Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, Alternative, Classic Rock, and even some country and classical. I'm pretty well-rounded in my musical tastes. I think that reflects me as a person also. I am  very accepting of all types of personal tastes that others may have. I like that about myself also. I wonder how my parents are feeling about me being gone. I hate to admit it but I really do miss them. I also miss my sisters and playing with their kids. My niece and nephew's are so much fun to play with. I wish they were right here with me right now. I would love to show them the campus. I feel really bad about my dad having to pay so much money for me to get my education here. I want to help out more. I hate it when my parents have to put up money for me. I usually try to stay independant of the them when it comes to cash. I need to get a job soon to help out money-wise. It will be hard juggling school and a job, but I did it in high school. I know college is different than high school, but it's something I have to do. It will make me feel better. I've liked my time here at LOCNAME so far though. This is a really neat place. I mentioned before that I feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to not make it stress me out. I'm pretty good at keeping my stress level low. Most people stress about little things, and that's not good for you. I'm hoping that I get good grades and I'm really going to try to do my best here and not just play around. Tomorrow is the September 00th anniversary (0 year). I see stuff about it all the time on TV. That event really made me feel patriotic and made me very very proud to be an American. It got me mad that people would do that. In fact it got me really mad. I wanted to do something and thoughts about joining the army came into my mind but I never really took that seriously. Instead I went to go donate blood. I figured I would try to help out any way I could. But all in all, I'm proud to be living in the greatest country in the world. I'm going to try and go to the ceromony on the south lawn. I hope it will be meaningful. Basically I have lots of emotions running through me, but the trick is to balance them as evenly as possible. 
__label__label1      I'm tired. I wish I did'nt have an 0 a. m. class everyPROPNAMEy. I have so much stuff to do and i forgot again to call regarding to job to apply for. My boyfriends coming on Friday and thats all i can really think about. It feels like I'm not really thinking about anything. Maybe I should not have tried to do this so early in the morning. Oh well. It is too dark in my room now and I really want to turn on the lights but my roomate is asleep. Wow twenty minutes is a really long time. Who knew? PROPNAME da PROPNAME. I'm bored. I really want to go do something active like outside but the weather is too bad. I hate when it rains. It puts me in a bad mood. It's actually cold in my room today maybe they fixed the air conditioning. I'm thinking about how i feel like i really don't have anything to say in this. I think my mind is like dead right now but maybe that's the point. I need to go take a shower, and do my homework for Economics and Ancient LOCNAME. I wish I could be sleeping like PROPNAME but no I'm awake writing this. I need to repaint my toenails. They're all chipped. No one wants to see that. Maybe I will do that after I finish this assignment. I miss PROPNAME. It's crazy how we have only been apart two weeks and I am so incapable of being by myself. I need to make some more friends here in LOCNAME. I do not want to only rely on my boyfriend for support. What if something happens? Agghh. Why do I say stuff like that. I miss my family and I miss how things were. I don't know if I'm ready for this whole college thing but I guess, maybe more I hope, that a lot of other people feel the same way. Everyone just seems so adjusted to the whole change. Why am I saying all this stuff for this assignment? I wonder why I keep looking at that tissue box? Seriously, I have like stared at it the whole time I have done this. I wonder if you all read these. I think we just get credit for completion but I hope this does not appear up on that big screen as like an example. That would suck. Still gloomy outside. I wish I lived in like LOCNAME or somewhere with really good non-humid weather. My hair looks pretty bad today but it never really looks that fantastic so I guess it's not that big of a change. I feel really whiny or something. I need to call PROPNAME. Maybe I could meet some people through her. I hope so. No class until 0:00. At least I have a lot of time to finish my other stuff. Goodness I still have over five minutes. I sure do a lot of random thinking in twenty minutes. Why would they put such uncomfortable chairs in a dorm when they know that kids are going to be sitting there most of the time. I am so stressed out. Maybe that's why my face is breaking out so bad. Again I think why did I just say that. I'm sure no one wants to hear about stuff like that. I hope no one reads it and they just see my social security number and check me off on like some list. That would be good. Oh well too late now. That fan is so loud. I wish our air conditioning just worked so we wouldn't have to have all these fans. They are really annoying. My hands hurt from typing this much. I feel like I'm trying to make myself think of things to say. Why does my left hand or I guess wrist hurt more than my right. I love stretching. I wonder why that feels so good. I want to eat some sour candy. I like that. I still think about my boyfriend. 
__label__label0     Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 0th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 00 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 0 0/0 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 00-00 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. 
__label__label1      right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me. i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week. i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a,little more hard core than its been. i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something. this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i don't know what is so weird about it. i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy's which is good but its not what i wanted. when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 0 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw. i don't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it. you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way. now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something. i think my cd is over now. no its not. i don't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying. oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd. my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one. maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one. i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something. oh well she can live. im really tired and its only like 0:00. probably because i woke up at like 0:00 this morning. this song is definitely the best on this cd. i love dave matthews- I've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome. ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then. that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there. not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway. it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener. i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random. is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything?  i don't think so- so oh well. my knee hurts. i think i should ice it or soemthing but i don't have an ice pack. i guess ill have to get that sometime. an ice pack and sweet tea. if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later. this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea. you can't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp be nasty. i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria?  i guess it doesnt matter. i miss the italian food from up there so much. i can't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there. not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time?  i need more pasta. penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created. i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something. you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here. or maybe its just me. i doubt it. ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in. hmm. im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something. haha how funny would that be?  and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this. im so 
__label__label0      As of this moment, I am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. I don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. I notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. I am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. I wonder what he has to say. I have this funny taste in my mouth after eating ORGNAME ORGNAME food. It isn't too pleasant. My refrigerator is making lots of noise. I think it's broken. Maybe I should get it fixed. No, I'm too lazy. I'm thinking about my boyfriend again. I think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but I don't know why I am thinking that because I love him or atleast I think I do. How do I know when I'm in love?  I ask myself this question everyday. I don't think I should be because if I was in love I would know. Love is very confusing. My boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. I haven't had this bad of a temper ever. I think some of his temper rubbed off on me. The refrigerator is making so much noise still. I feel nauseous. I want to join a sorority, but I am not sure which one to join because I have heard bad things about the ones I am interested in. I also want to join a service one, but at the same time I want to join a social one. I think I'm just going to join this service one I heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. I miss ORGNAME ORGNAME. I used to work there with my best friend. I wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. Sometimes I feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. She tends to do that. I'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but I don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. Well I know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. The refrigerator stopped making noise. Yay!  I'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. I'm confused about the directions. Are we supposed to write until the 00 minutes are over or when we finish?  That is what I ask myself. I'm really sleepy. My eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. I haven't gotten much sleep in a while. People keep staying in my dorm room and I can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. Sometimes I wish I could just tell people how I feel straight up but that never happens. I think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. She used to get mad just because I told her the truth, so I feel like I'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. Well this assignment was good. I got to speak my mind and release some stress. 
__label__label0      Today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. I sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes I feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. We aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 00th. I mean the nice safe world I lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. I didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. Now, I occasionally do doubt. And most of all, thinking about the 00th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards LOCNAME, I am angry at the world, at people, I don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 0 will grow up in. She is a very close part of me, I feel very close and love her very much. She's my   little sis.   And to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. I mean on ond hand I am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in LOCNAME far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, I will be fine. And then I get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how I am American and she is American and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. PROPNAME is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, I would be devistated if anything happened to her, I would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. I feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that Americans have adopted. I am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as I can because I do not want her to fear life. I want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world I grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but I face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. I find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like I am alternating bewteen a world where I realize the new threats involved with LOCNAME and the possibility of war. Just recently, I started paying close attention to the news coverage of PROPNAME PROPNAME and his disregard to ORGNAME weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. Realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. I relize the seriousness of the LOCNAME conflict, the seriousness of the 00th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. Maybe because I am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. Nevertheless, I am bothered by this whole change in our world. I have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, I have plans of becoming a doctor one day and I have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. I never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. I am 00, should this much stuff be present in my life?  You know, I heard Amazing Grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on TV tonight and was emotionally moved. That song always does that to me. It can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. I wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. That was the first song I ever played on the piano and trumpet if I am remembering correctly. I miss my parents, mostly my little sister. I am going back this weekend, but I am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because I have mcuh homework to finish. I guess thats another struggles I am dealing with in my life currently. I started thinking about how much I love my grandparents. They live right up a little path from our house in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. I would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. Now I rarely ever see them because I am in college. I will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time I have now to spend with them?  Is spending time in college worth the sacrifice I am making. Why can't I spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on. 
__label__label0 It's three thirty in the afternoon right now, and i'm working on my psychology homework. this is a very interesting assignment; i've never done one quite like this. it's actually quite easy--just putting my thoughts on this site and having it timed. quite fascinating. i'm excited today because i finally got my internet and cable installed!! it's been almost 0 weeks since i've been able to watch tv on my own and to use my own internet to get online!! i don't know how i made it, but i'm still alive. hehe. i'm glad that the time-warner people finally got the address right. the first time they came, the went to the wrong apartment complex!! how aggravating!! i've never been more miserable in my entire life!! but today, i'm feeling competely opposite!! ahh. the joys of modern technology. right now, my desk is hurting my arms. since i'm typing, the fleshy part of my arm is getting pushed into the edge of the desk, thus creating a groove in my skin which is sometimes painful. other than that, i'm ok. oh, but my chair is also making impressions on the back of my leg. i'm wearing shorts now so the back of my legs have a cloth pattern on them. my computer is working fine right now, which i am very grateful for. my friend stephen just instant messenged me, but i can't really reply back to him right now since i am doing this writing assignment, which is timed. i feel like i am writing a lot, but perhaps it is because i type fast. hmm. could be. well, i seem to be making many typos. i guess i should slow down and think of what i am writing before i write it. i sometimes get ahead of myself when i am thinking of what to write and it wreaks havoc on my typing. twenty minutes is a long time if you think about it. i mean, i've typed all of this in just seven minutes and twenty three seconds. i'm also trying to figure out which of my friends i should call to help me with the downloading of music. it's the greatest thing on the internet, but somehow i can't get it to work as efficiently as they can. all they have to do to play a song is click the list of songs that they have on the side of their screen, but when i want to play a song, i have to pull up a separate folder. bleh!! so i need to call one of my friends. but who should i call?? let's see. there's stephen, who im'ed me, rex, maria, sarika (she's going home this weekend though), mitra, lindsay (or is it -ey?), maria, her boyfriend zack, her boyfriend's friend stephen, ha, tahera, or jessica. i'm sure i know more people, but i can't think of them right now. the sad thing with the people i just listed is that almost all of them went to the same high school as i did. i need to meet new people. i can't hang out with the same few people every single day. but it's so hard to meet people when the classes have hundreds of people in them each. i go to class sitting next to a different person every single time. i rarely see the same person in my classes. i guess that's what i get for taking all the introductory classes. this stream of consciousness thing is cool. i'm thinking about my syntax (haha. such an ap english 0 word) and it's weird. i never normally talk like this. i feel as though i am babbling to myself or trying to sound intelligent as i babble. i guess i don't talk in an ignorant way, but i feel as though i sound more sophisticated than i really sound in real life. so i might go see a movie with my friends next friday entitled   one hour photo.   the ever so famous robin williams is in the movie, along with the very appealing guy from the hit show alias, michael vartan. the show alias is really cool--this girl named sydney, played by jennifer garner, is this spy/counterspy and she does all this cool stuff with all her high tech gadgets. and michael vartan plays her handler. now i'm talking on the phone with my friend maria. she called about what we want to do tonight. so we might play monopoly. apparently rex brought monopoly. or maybe it's rex who has it. i don't know. all i know is that now i have to call rex and see if he wants to play monolopy after his chinese bible study thing. i went to this chinese/taiwanese association thing the other night, and i felt so white-washed. that means that i don't feel like i'm as asian as them. i guess that could be a bad thing, but it probably was because half of those people were fobbish. fobbish means that they just got to the states so they're still really foreign-like. it kind of makes them stand out, but if they're ok with it, then it doesn't matter. i'm almost finished!! woohoo!! now i have to go call rex and see what we're doing tonight. good bye! 
__label__label1      I'm very worried about many things right now. I feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. I haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. I'm usually a guy that stays on top ORGNAME things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like I'm not on top of things. I have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. I should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. I'm in LOCNAME right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. Home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. Most of the time I was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. I find that LOCNAME is not as fun as it was. Things are starting to change. My views and my emotions are quite different than before. I view my parents and my brother differently. I appreciate their company more than i did before. I guess I just miss them an awful lot. My brother and I are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in LOCNAME. I enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. I'm also kind of glad that I am going back to LOCNAME later today. I missed alot while I was gone. A friend's birthday party, ORGNAME's first football game, and a Chinese Bible Study meeting that i was hoping to attend. I can gladly say that I don't regret comming to LOCNAME and being back home. I enjoyed it fairly well. Suddenly, I feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. I'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that I should be doing, but I have a smile on my face. A sense of peace and a sense of sadness that I'm going to depart from this wonderful place I call home. Both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. I can smell it from upstairs. I haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. ORGNAME of ORGNAME is not what I had in mind. It is not as fun and exciting as I thought it would be. All my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. I guess things will get better as time progresses. I'm still not use to the freedom that I have and still not use to other things. I have also found out that I have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. I rather just be around those that I feel more comfortable around. The people at ORGNAME are nice thus far, I have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. I enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. I have learned that friendships are very important. Since I use to move alot, from places to places, I have learned how to make friends and still be myself. I feel like I have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. I was very close to him and we were like brothers. Now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. My friend has never dated before, but now is dating. He spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. I really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. I hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. College will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that I will never experience before. Sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future PROPNAME PROPNAME. 
__label__label0      well PROPNAME starting this assignment and its hard to write what PROPNAME thinking because all I seem to be thinking about is what PROPNAME thinking and that is what I have to write also im sorta worried about the poor grammer and lack of sentences which is about to follow this its hard to type a contiuning stream with sentences so o well this is graded on completion so i guess im not getting   points taken off   for lack of coherency. . i really have no clue what the point of this is because since im writing it all i can think about is what I have said above which is writing this. PROPNAME about to drink some of my mountain dew next to me if that counts for anything? im trying to cram all of this junk for my classes in today because I havent gone this week for some reason. I really should have but i dident feel like it, i probly should be more responsible. but o well my pre cal homework is bothering me since i can't figure out if Im doing it right so im probly just going to give up im rather bored right now but tommorow at least I get to judge at the westlake debate tourny and thats always good fro 000 dollers or so sometimes my mind goes blank and it seems like Im having to force myself to contiually type, is that cheating? I really have nothing to write now Im not really thinking of anything i wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now my roomate is playing ncaa 0000 college football right now and its quite loud and sorta distracting me from this but I havent stopped typing yet but I guess it doesnt matter i wonder how long i can make this thing go with just type a non coherent rant about nothing this seems rather pointless to me but o well I don't need a 0 I've got enough of those in pre cal im thinking about dropping hmm what I just notice im typing this like Im typing this to some one, like Im complaining to someone about stuff there I go again another instance where my mind went blank and i had nothing to think about err I just thought about indians now for no real reason i have this banner that makes me money at the bottom of my browser thats not tracking my actions right now because it considers me inactive my buddy list keeps chiming with people coming online i wonder how much time i have left i just thought about the girl i met first day in psych class who told me when she did a stream of concenus it turned out about peeps and some band I can't remeber right now on a beach im about half way done now in time at least this is rather boring to I should probly do my anthro considering i have a quiz tommorrow and I havent even opened the book I don't even know what the cover looks like yet. Im a slaker i need to really get more self motivated to do my work but it all seems pointless to me that i have to be in some restrained system of pointlessness and have to take a bunch of classes that arnt going to to serve me any real purpose i want to be a debate teacher i would like to just focus on that and not have to take classes that don't have anything to do with it what does pre cal do for anyone anyhow nothing my mind keeps popping up with a lot of different random things but im not allowing myself to just start typeing random words Im finding it difficult to do this assignment since I can't just let myself go and type whats going on through my mind but rather i have several streams of thought going and im just choosing the more organized one i guess i could try to just start typng random words like sock monkey and donation tree but i had already thought of that before I typed them so i don't see how I can allow my self this is boring i just just give up coherency and type random things aoll qb get to confortable im worrying about typos im more or less tell you what im doing rather then what im thinking i just i keep deleting things and re wrting them because i hit the wrong letters I guess thats not good either since im obviously can't be contiually typing if im stopping to coreect typos im stopping now who cares if it can't be read its nothing to raead anyhow im just typing random rnams otnwoanm now I m going to rtong not to hit the backspace now but I don't think I can its a habit like locking the door i did it again a lot just now in that senstence i can't seem to stop myself i ve decied to not look at the screen when Im typing now so I can't backspace anymore but I don't know that it matter but hey its something to do I still have roughly 0 mins left I beklieve I don't know hmmm this is boring the keys the keys kthek eyes ching mouthani ntdw tddrinkn see that was horrible Im lookng at the scree n again I want top backspace some more and I probly will I wonder how mloogn aifniabhgoabhglbajklglfyfyilflgfvygflglgugglgklglkglkglkg i have about 0 mins left this is starting to annoy me i've probly done it wrong if thats possible but o well this is as well as I could do it hmmm I don't want to do anything but check out cross-x but I need to study which I probly won't end up doing I;ll probly take my antrho quiz but I probly won't turn in my math homework o well i gues s Im going to fail eck i have never failed so i probly won't but I really need to get with it work out snl hairy somethingawful. com is cool see I don't know how to do this my mind starts thinking random words and I don't know if im supposed to type them or waht it just doesnt mcdonalds shower in other apt across hall this is just incohrent like most odf this rant and annoying so im going to stop I think times almost up Im going to check about 0 mins left most of this piece seems like im struggling with myself because im indecisive about my own stream of consensaih cons err I can't spell but what ever the title my roomate just told me I left my cloths in the dryer I don't think I did so Im going to go check when this timer is done I need it to hurry up because he needs to do his laundry blah b lah blah moo this timer about 00 more seconds then I can finalyl be done and be roughly caught up with psych bah the days came by so fast hmm I think the timer is over now or at least like 0 seconds away 0 -0 do no I won't contiune my time is up. 
__label__label0 I am sitting in my dorm room listening to my roomate talk on the phone to her boyfriend. I have just finished studying and everything i have just read is all jumbled in my head. I am thinking about the weekend and what I am going to do because my roomate's sister is coming to stay with us. She is a junior and has just come out and said that she is depressed. I want to take her out and make sure she has a good time. However, I went to my chapter meeting tonight and they told us that this weekend we were having out pledge retreat and a field day on Saturday. I have so much to study for and so much reading and I have to entertain a 00 year old girl. I don't know how I am going to get everything done. But I know that everything will work our because it always does. I am listening to little pieces of information about my roomates conversation and am very curious as to what is going on. It sounds very interesting. I am just thinking about everything that I need to do and all of the people I need to talk to. It is so difficult when you have to talk to all of your friends from your hometown and talk to your mother while trying to go to class, meetings, and everything else. It seems there are never enough hours in the day. My roomate is offering our room to a couple of her friends to come stay at our dorm this weekend. The girls are extremely annoying and I think I will have to find somewhere to stay. Hopefully our retreat is overnight. It has been alright with my roomate and I. He were best friends in Elementary school but things do change. I came in the other night and she was drunk and was trying on my clothes. It pissed me off but I can't say anything just because she is too nice. She left this weekend and went to LOCNAME LOCNAME and stayed with her boyfriend. They got a hotel room for the night. It was nice having the room all to myself. I have my entire schedule with a boy who I went to high school with. I was shocked at first but now it is very helpful. We can tell each other and remind each other about assignments and other things. I went to my FIG class today and felt like I was back in the fifth grade. He assigned us a project where we have to create a shield. The usual what you like, a word that describes you, and other stuff to that nature. I finally talked to my ex-boyfriend today for the first time in a couple of weeks. We broke up because we were going to different colleges and he couldn't handle it. He is too much of a guy. Everyone went home this weekend in my dorm and I was all alone. Our room smells like chinese food because we can't take our trash out until Thursday so until then it stinks. I still have not done an laundry yet because out dorn is out of special laundry cards. I need to go to the grocery store to buy more folders and drinks. I will probably leave and go with a girl who lives down my hall. I am excited that I don't have class tomorrow until 0:00. We have a ORGNAME mexican lunch tomorrow that I am taking my best friend to. Everyone in my pledge class is so caught up with PROPNAME PROPNAME. I almost think people joined it because she is in it. She is just like every other girl in that room with the exception that her father is the President of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. At our meeting tonight the ORGNAME ORGNAME was there. That part if kind of cool to see them. It gives you a sense of security that you are protected as well. All of the girl in my pledge class are really nice. I met the sweetest girl down my hall. I am going to her Grandmother's 00th birthday party in a couple of weeks somewhere near LOCNAME with her. My computer keeps messing us and the pointer is going to the middle of the page. My suitemate just made popcorn and is offering it to us. It smells incredible. 
__label__label1      I am waiting for PROPNAME to get home. I hope that he's talking to PROPNAME because they need to figure out what's happening before things get worse. I can't believe he's being so petty about this whole ordeal. Seriously, was he expecting us to pat him on the back and say how proud we are that he's started smoking pot. . not just a little either. . but massive amounts?  I don't quite understand how on earth he can simply think that just because he's been on medications and is immune and he's sick and is in pain that that is a valid excuse. We all have our issues to escape from, while i'll agree that yes none of us face exactly what he's going through with his disorders and his back, we have our problems too. I hate to see him like this, feeding himself bs to justify it. He knows it was wrong, i honestly think he knows its wrong and he claims he regrets it but deep down i don't think he does. This is his rebellion. What kills it the most is that it shows just how hypocritical he can be. Maybe a year ago he was bashing one of his really good friends for doing something so similar. . the guilt trips, the icq away messages, the finger pointing. Its all the same. I know thats what scares brad so much about it, because michael is his best friend, and he can't stand to see him turn into benny. Neither can i. I've known one too many people who end up permenately stoned so bad that they can't remember anything past the last fix. Its so sad to watch them as they stop being able to function. I know, just know that one of these days i'm going to get a call from someone saying that one by one they're dying off. Its so sad. Some of my best friends have become drug addicts and have nearly lost their lives because of it, and yet they continue to use it. Now they might as well be dead. . they have no personality and they'll never be the same people they once were. Drugs make you petty. They've all become petty. I worry how this effects brad. He's right, PROPNAME basically is his only friend, guy friend anyway. If PROPNAME were to hold this against him it would definately kill him and would seriously screw with his future. PROPNAME has a hard time making friends. I'm actually incredibly surprised we're even together conisdering his track record. He's the shyest drama major I've ever met. He won't talk to people. I have to talk for him sometimes, and he gets upset if i don't introduce him. Most people know who he is, they just don't believe me. When i talk about him i talk about either why he's got me frustrated or how great he is, and when he meets my friends nothing. . he sits there and stares. He promises he'll try and its not something i hold against him. . yes it kind of annoys me but i seriously don't hold it against him. Marked up as one of his quirks. I have so many i guess i can't really hold his agianst him since he doesn't hold mine against me. I can't believe that PROPNAME would hold a grudge. . he's always gotten so mad at me for having my grudges since last year and always lectured me and i've listened and tried not to hold what they did to me against them, that whole christian turn the other cheek forgiveness thing. I'm trying. . honestly i am. BUT i must admit life is SO much easier when i don't have to be around them. No constant reminder of all the stuff that happened last year. Its a new chapter in my life and its so great that although they followed me here, they don't have to be a part of it. I just want brad to be happy. The old michael wouldn't have had this problem, but he's changed recently, and definatley not for the better. Almost makes me feel the need to return the favor. Just as they controled and manipulated and abused me last year, he is their victim now, and it makes me so sad. He's a great guy. He just should have taken his own advice and gotten out of there as fast as he could. PROPNAME would have understood, and if he's anything like they claim, he DEFINATELY would not approve of the life his friends have chosen. Drugs won't bring him back. He died its time for all of them to move on. I just don't know if they'll ever realize that. Some won't ever . . i wonder if we can make micael see that before its too late. 
__label__label0      The kitchen is so sterile and cold. I must say that this is a bit intimidating; writing your thoughts down on an electronic module for someone else to analyze and decide who you are. My mom keeps looking over at me. I can tell she wants to talk to me but I am avoiding her glare without trying to seem rude. It's really making me sad that I have to move back home from living on my own. I hate not having a space that is mine and I always feel like I am hurting someone's feelings with my disinterest in their daily lives. My dad calls like 0 times a day it seems whenever I am home and that creeps me out. I hope I don't end up like that. Very clingy. My feet hurt. I wish I could go change shirts because the kitchen is so cold and this tank top is not doing it for me but I am filling out this what-ever-you-call-it. I wonder what people make of me in general. Im sure their impression of me on paper is a bit different that in person. That makes me sad. I think I come off as more uptight than I actually am although I still seem like a hippy no matter how hard I try to suppress my bohemian leanings. My hair is so short I can feel the cold air on the back of my neck. It is so like my dad to keep the tempature of the house so friggin' cold during August that I want to dethaw in the heat. PROPNAME seems to have gotten along fine without me this last week and a half now that she has moved into the co-op. It hurts my feelings that she only cares about me when she has no other better option. I am her best friend though but still, I hate feeling like the backup. I am not the backup for PROPNAME, however. He is so sweet. I can't believe he decided to drive all the way down from LOCNAME to come visit me. I miss him so bad and it hasnt even been a month yet. I feel like a hormonal boy, this is how much I miss him. Kissing is never the main part of our relationship definately but my body seems to be confused as to where he has gone. Where has he gone? I really don't see the good reason for him moving off to LOCNAME though and not even immediately starting college there. I know that whole band thing but I really think it has a lot to do with his family. Between those two huge families, god, that boy doesnt stand a chance as far as an independant existance. His mom, PROPNAME, is so fucked up though. I can't believe she left PROPNAME for that abusive asshole. I hate that guy so much; such an ass. I am tired and I will be pissed off if PROPNAME doesnt call me back soon. She is leaving for LOCNAME tomorrow and has put off seeing me for two long of a period. She is no longer my best friend and I am no longer hers but she, for some reason, cannot accept this and instead always makes it out like I am rejecting her or something when this is not the case at all. If anything it is the other way. She totally ditched me this summer and then has the audacity to claim  I am pushing her away. Ouch. Good thing we really arent close anymore or else I would want to cry. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. Saturday night or Sunday morning? I wonder when he will come in. It would be so cool to have him come into the Cafe while I am working and surprise me. Well, I guess it wouldnt be a surprise if I secretly expect/ hope for it. I was so nervous today in Italian. God, can I type fast. My hands just can't seem to keep up with my thoughts. Much  like my short legs can't keep up with my stride and thus, I walk in fast short steps, very embarrassed. PROPNAME's long legs are a hoot next to mine. I think he is a whole foot taller than me. We also weigh the same. Talk about weird. He is skinny and I am   vuluptuous  . I hate that PROPNAME thought that feminists were all whiney bitches. That's just like saying all Christians are homophobes. Simply not true. Damn, the phone just rang and it was my mom. She calls me even on her errrands just to tell me that PROPNAME called. How more nosey, clingy and in general annoying can you get? I am tired of mom and dad always calling every second they are away. Those are two people who do NOT need cell phones. My fingers are cold. Sometimes I wonder if I have bad nerves or something because my fingers and toes are always cold it seems. I am so nervous about my Italian One class. All that pronounciation in front of strangers and an intimidating teacher. It freaks me out to an extent that I can hardly even mutter prego. I am such a shy socially inept dork but I love it all the same. Okay, I was just imformed that the 00 minutes are up. Goodbye. For now. Until you enter my thoughts again. 
__label__label1      well i am not exactly sure what i should be writing about but i guess it have no choice. i am noticing that my room is overly cluttered, that the tv is on and that my neighbors dog is barking i feel kind of warm althought that isnt totally weird i usaully am warm in this place. i have to be at work by 000 and i hope i can make it. i don't really like working there anymore because it is usually very stressfull, all the snobby rich people and the terrible managment, no my foot hurts probably because i have been placing my weight under it, tomorrow i don't have to work so i guess i can work out, i do like to work out its more the act of dealing with all the people in my way that i don't like. i don't like waiting. i hate when someone is just sitting on a machine or talking and isnt doing anything wastes my time. i also don't like it much when people talk to me in the gym, takes me away from what i am there to do. the semester has just started and i already feel a little pressure from all the upcoming events, the reading , the studying, the homework. sometimes i wonder why i am here, i start to think that maybe i am wasting my time when i have no idea what i am doing with my career, should i have known before i got to college?  i don't think so, thats what its all about, learning about yourself, finding out who you really are. wow only 0 minutes have gone by. this is going to be a long assignment, i wonder how long eveyone elses assignments were. i am sure they were longer, seems like i never write enough or my writing is too vague. however last semester in government i did very well in my writing assingments. i tend to do better in the analytical process then i do in the creative process or at least thats how it seems to me, however some times i do have a very clever idea or unique way of looking at a porblem that enables me to break through. it usually invloves some one telling me i can't do something. that usually kicks my brain into over drive, i usually never tell myself i can't do it, just that i havent figured out how to yet. that makes it easier for me to look at that problem. this may sound retarted but when i was in highschool and my parents started locking the liqour cabinet, i remember looking at it and thinking wow  how am i going to get around that. i don't see a problem as a barrier, but a wall to climb, so i took out the drawer on the top of the cabinet and reached my hand inside and pulled out whatever i needed, it sounds terrible but it was a very good solution to the problem of how to get the tequila out of the locked cabinet. sometimes i wonder what i would be able to do with harder real problems. i like thinking that i can defy others imagination, makes me feel like i am a little more clever than they have imagained. i always enjoyed upsetting peoples ideas of myself. or breaking stereotypes but putting my self into a place to be judged in that given stereotype, like when i shaved my head, i am in no way a skin head and i adopt none of their ideals or beliefs but i enjoy seeing the look of surprise on someones face when i can have a complex conversation on engineering concepts or hamurabi, or some eastern philosophy. its the initial look of dawning comprehension that i live for. like when i hide things from some one i want them to figure out where it is, just so i can see that burst of intelligence into their thought process that enlightens them to the location of their shoe, or where there keys are. even better then that is to have them have that dawning but then when they reach for their shoe it isnt their shoe, the sudden seize of thought is also as rewarding. or seeing if you can predict some ones actions but predict two steps forward so that when they realize you have predicted their action and begin to change you have predicted their realization of you predicting. the one thing i love of about the human body is its ability to change, to become something different then what it start out as, but in the end we are all the same, nothing more than complex organic molecules and one could argue that we really arent that complex just resilient. i want to make the human machine better, smarter, faster, stronger, but is it possible to perfect millions of years of constant evolution?  who knows, maybe the next step will be to fuse mental ability with a better creature, something that man creates in his own image, we could build on the millions of years it took humans to become what we are. and in turn we could make the next level of human evolution, but this might threaten the entire order of things, we would no longer be the top of the food chain. and these altered beings would they be good  or would they use their abilites for selfish purposes. i think that if i was some how better than everyone else then i would use my abilities for good, but isnt that asking alot of some one?  what if they want to be self serving, just because they have these incredible gifts should they be forced to serve. Tis better to rule in hell then to serve in heaven. what would the world be like if everyone only looked out for themselves, we wouldnt have any firemean any policemen, no one would help others, or at least not without some sort of compensation. i enjoy doing something for someone when i don't expect to recieve anything in return, makes you feel better about yourself, and if they do give you something then it makes you feel 000% better then before, its not what you do  but who you do it for i would rather do something great for someone else then to do something great for myself 
__label__label1      Wow, I remember when my english teacher made me do this. It is kind of weird having to do it now. I don't think my teacher really liked english at all. What was the deal with the random acts of kindness journal anyway?  PROPNAME PROPNAME is a great musician. I should put his CD on now to break the silence. 00 minutes?  I think I might have to piss sometime in the next 00 minutes. I guess I should have thought of that sooner. I need some   my-size   chicks in my classes. I see them around campus occasionally, but never in my classes. Actually, there may have been some in Psy. , but there were 000+ people. Damn it! I don't need to install any more MS stuff. Quit popping up that update!  I said okay yesterday hoping it would cut me a break, but it is just like the ORGNAME ORGNAME . once you donate stuff, they never give you a break. Hoo Hah!  PROPNAMEe for some PROPNAME. Man, I love the woofer on my computer!  I have the best,   phattest   bass on my computer stereo. I think my parents miss me. When I call them, it is hard to get off of the phone ever. I hope that I don't get much homework in college. I like SNL, where Tim PROPNAME did that sketch with the SportsCenter impersonation.   Right about now, the funk soul brother PROPNAME PROPNAME!  Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Sweet sassy molassy!    I can't wait until PROPNAME PROPNAME comes back to LOCNAME. His concert was cool. I need to keep on writing. ORGNAME ORGNAME was a sweet film. I really like the girlfriend in that movieGoddamn update reminder just froze up my computer!!!! ORGNAME is an evil empire!  They don't even give you a way to close the reminder so you just have to leave it there. Crapola!  Don't even ask me when I want to be reminded of the update. Suck it, PROPNAME!  I bet I seem kind of screwed up if anyone browses this. I love the PROPNAME song   comfortable,   even though it is a chick song. I wonder if these shoes make me look gay when I wear them with shorts?  Oh well, they are comfortable, so whoa, I just spaced out there for a few minutes. I really should go change the punctuation of the previous sentence. I have always felt like I am missing out on something by never having a girlfriend. LOCNAME kind of sucked. Maybe it is like getting a car- it is cool for a week or two, and then it loses its glamor. I wonder why no one is sunbathing on Jester beach Damn it! I don't want to update my computer! I did it yesterday!  I miss the good 'ole DOS days. Go to hell, PROPNAME!  Man, for a multi-billionaire, you would think he could get a friggin' descent haircut. It looks nice outside, with the warm sun rays blanketing the gently swaying oak limbs outside my grimy window. I wonder why people say it is a nice day outside, when it is actually better to have cloudy skies to block UV rays and keep me from having to squint. I think the people across the hall are kind of strange. Not PROPNAME and PROPNAME, but their suitemates. They have all those slutty posters on their wall and whenever I walk by they are playing computer games. Dr. Pepper is the shiznat!  Shiznat . he he he he he!  I am such a friggin' loser! Criminy!  I just lost it again for about 00-00 seconds. I only have two minutes to go now, so I think it is time for a new paragraph.  My fingers are tingling a little bit, which is pretty strange since they should be getting blood from my typing. Oh, well. Maybe I should have kept playing guitar instead of biking. Racing is fun, but you can play guitar anywhere and you don't have to worry about crashing or winning or anything like that. You just can't screw up much while playing in front of an audience. I just copied most of my writing so I can see how much I did. 
__label__label0 I am sitting at my desk at work. I should be doing other things. I'm angry for having to work today. This should be a day off. I could have taken it off but then I wouldn't get paid. No paid vacation for part time. I am tired even though I got a good amount of sleep last night. I really  shouldn't be tired. I don't feel like going to the gym this afternoon but I wil. I go the gym five days a week and I don't know why. I really don't see any real difference in my body. I started going really to improve myself but I have noticed no change in the several months I've been there. Never the less I still go everyday. I guess I'm just hoping it will pay off. I would really like a nap. Even if i skip the gym and go straight home I can't take a nap. I have homework to do. Not really required home work but reading and prepairing for classes this wek. I am realy trying to stay on top of all my classes this semester. If I slakck off I'll have serious problems in some of my courses. I'm not really sure if this is what I should be writing about. I'm just writing about what I'm thinking about as I sit here tyoing away. The more I think about it these are pretty normal thoughts for me. Most days I am tired and want to skip going to the gym. And most days I still go to the gym. Despite not seeing results I'm not what I would call discouraged. I never think of quiting going to the gym, I just wonder why I see no difference. And everyday I think about all the things I have to do at home that evening. What checks I need to write for bills. I need to write my rent check tonight. I also need to elt my roommates know that the electric and water bill is due soon. I need to change the elevtric and water bil out of my name because I am moving. Thats another thing I have to do when I get home tonight. I havve to start deciding waht I can fir into my new apartment and what I have to store or sell. These are all really basic thoughts for me. I'm always thinking ahead and planning what needs to be done at night or tomorrow or nex week etc. I am very organized, maybe too much if there is such a thing. I dion't really know anyone who is as organized as me. My mother doesn't call me organized she calls me controlling and anal retentive. I prefer organized and in control. I'm not always in control, but she doesn't know that. I don't tell her how out of control I feel in my relationship with my boyfriend. This is also another normal daily thought for me. Why I stay with someone who doesn't feel the same for me as I do for him. Or at least he is not sure. I often wonder if I'm stupid for staying, or is it just him who is tupid because he can't figure out what he wants or what he feels. Maybe its both. Thinkng about how much time I give to my boyfriend and how to limit that time is also a normal daily thought for me, at least lately. I am a planner, I like to know what the plans are for tonight or tomorrow night or the weekend. He doesn't make plans with anyone until that evening arrives. I've gotten to expect that from him but I can't say I've gotten use to it. I wish he would tell me his plans ahead of time but I know that he won't so I'm learining to adapt. I guess it is probaly good for someone like me to be with someone who makes her just relax. I know that everything doesn't have to be planned but for some reason I do try to plan everything I can. Controlling the caos I guess, or to try to control the best I can. I am really out of daily thoughts. I don't know what else to say. writing for twenty minutes straight is hard. My thought are just normal. I am listening to the radio and I don't know this song. Not that it matters I just leave the radio on at work for some background noise. Oh wait, I do know this song. I just didn't recognize it at first. I have a lot of reading to do tonight that I'm not looking forward to. Biology mostly. M developmental calss looks like it will be challenging but possibly very enjoyable. Who am I kidding, by the end of the semester very few classes are enjoyable they are just over and I am always glad just to pass. As orgainsed as I am  I sometimes feel overwhelmed at the beging of the semester trying to get everything organised and figure out what classes to give studying priority to. I usually study first the class I have next. I will fo home and read biology before I read psychology because I have biology tomorrow and psychology is not until wednesday.     
__label__label1 I am starting over again. I am real mad. I was about 00 min into my first writing and I clinked on some link and this page transferred to somewhere else and everything was lost. That sucks. That sucks. That Sucks. I do not know what else to write. FRUSTRATION. nothing is more annoying. last year at 0 am in the morning my computer froze. I lost 0 or 0 pages of work for a a research paper that was do the next morning. that was infuriating. maybe almost cried. probably not. about as angry at myself as I have ever been though. bloodied my hand on a wall I was so mad then. I'm not angry enough now to hit anything. it is only twenty minutes and I have done nothing all day. the link I clicked was so stupid. it was in my friends profile. quotes from my calc teacher last year. they weren't funny when I read them. I knew they wouldn't be anyway. but I had to click on the damn link. wish I could get that moment back. about one hundred quotes and not one was funny. the kid who made this list of quotes has way too much time on their hands. not that I don't. it is 0 in the afternoon and the only time I have been out of my dorm is too get food. nothing else so far. that is pretty sad. staring and tvs and computer screen hurts my eyes. throbbing is only word I can think of to describe my feeling. feel like going back to bed. I sleep way too much. winamp. music. weezer. play. el scorcho. god damn you half japanese girls. do it to me every time. all the red heads said you shred the jello and I'm jello baby. two won't talk won't think of me. I'm the epitome. I can't keep up typing the song lyrics. I had it going good for a while. I asked you to go to the green day concert. you said you never heard of them. I'm not going to tey and type lyrics anymore. I'm not in the mood for weezer. stop. change. bela fleck. something anyone can always listen too. no lyrics to tey and type at least. locks of dread. I hear drums and some weird keyboard type instrument. I'm not really sure. definitely a bass and maracas or something of that nature. not important. great song. I feel better. one of few songs that can make me feel better by listening to. I wonder how many words I spelled wrong/typos. go back and check. NO. ha. not that important. this is my stream of conscious. I don't think this is working. would I normally think about these things if I was not trying to record thought. only thing I think I am really thinking about is what I am thinking or what I should think next. maybe not. I confused myself. somehow I went to a page of lines or something. when I went back my time clock started at zero again. I am going to have to estimate my twenty now. why my page went squiggly line. I have no idea. I hate computers, they think they can just do whatever they want. freeze throw pop ups at you, turn off, and a million other things. machines will take over. judgment day is near. no. but terminator 0 could be greatest movie of all time. my occupation is to do what I like - this os my friends away message. a lyric of a song we both think is hilarious. glad to see him with that away message. the stars are bright and big at night - deep in the heart of texas ( clap clap clap) pee wee hermans big adventure. a lot better than big top pee wee. my friend just send me instant message: do you have a pic of prof account. " he is mad I don't understand him. I'm sorry but I don't. me means a pickaprof. com account. I have never even heard of this. should I have. I have no idea. I guess I don't really care. well after accidentally hitting back my time is messed up again and I am going to say it has been twenty minutes. I wonder if I did this right. were these thoughts too forced. 
__label__label0 It is 00:00 and I would really like to go to sleep right now. I think I would feel better if I could just take my eyes out of my head. It's cold in here. My finger itches and I don't know why. It won't stop and its affecting my writing. I hope I used the right form of ?affect? in that last sentence. I hope I don't have any spelling errors either. I have so many things to study and I'm trying to figure out when I can do it all. There's a really cool show on the TV that's on about mummies. It's very interesting. I think I missed PROPNAME and PROPNAME on the Cartoon Network today. My finger stopped itching. Now my arm itches (and I'm not making this up just to copy the example in class), it really does itch. I need to pay some bills later. I just want to go to sleep right now. I hope I will go to sleep tonight because I couldn't last night. My arm stopped itching. I don't know what else to write and I've still got 00 minutes left. Boy, this is taking a long time. Now the TV is on some stupid show and I would change it but I have to keep typing. I think I'll take a nap after this so I don't fall asleep in class. That LOCNAME LOCNAME I had for lunch was really good. I'll need to drink so more water before I go back out in the heat or I'll collapse. This humidity kills me. Walking around campus is very good exercise though. I need to remember to take my calculator to math Friday. Well, that's almost 0 more minutes. I mean, it's not a bad writing assignment, its just feels so monotonous. I had to pop my fingers a second. I probably should call my cousin who lives in LOCNAME, but I really don't want her to be over here all the time least she find out where I live. That reminds me, I need to go switch my meal card later and check my voice mail. 0 minutes to go. I hope you don't think I'm crazy by reading this but you probably do so, oh well. 0 more minute. 0 more minute ten I can take a nap. Almost there. 00 seconds. THE END 
__label__label1 I am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. I can't really smell anything because I'm getting over a cold. I'm thinking about last night. My sorority had a party at PROPNAME's and my date just didn't show up. I've been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. Either way he owes me big time. Now I'm listening to the Doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. I trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. I have a class today that I have to read for before 0 o'clock. I really don't feel like reading for that class, but I guess I have to. It's biology and I like the class, but I just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which I am not to excited about. My foot is starting to hurt because I was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. I hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up I guess you would call it. This CD that I'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. It's not my CD or I would know what is on it. I wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. I mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. It's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. I have a download capability on my computer but I don't use it all that often, so I doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. I understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. Many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the CD. I have no idea who this song playing is by. I still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, I really need to try and wash them off before I forget about it and go to class with them still on. I don't like the way they write exes on your hands. Is not one hand enough? They really don't need to mark both of them. I don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. There would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. Last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as I was expecting it to be. Well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. I'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so I'm more excited about that. He is not coming in until much later though, I wish he could come earlier. I also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for ORGNAME ORGNAME, another thing that the sorority throws. Life is so hectic at college, I don't ahve time to really do anything. I don't know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I'm behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. But then next week, the cycle starts all over again. I guess that's why I feel like I'm never caught up completely. We're listening to School's Out for Summer", I wish it was! But that won't happen for a very very long time. But I had fun this summer. I didn't have a job, so I got to do whatever I wanted. It was fun. I really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. They're all clean but thrown around from when I was trying to figure out what to wear last night. I need to go to the grocery store too, I'm out of bottled water and drinks. I need to get more hangers too. Ok enough of this random writing, my 00 minutes are up. 
__label__label1 right now I am feeling tired and a little burnt out. I have had a quiz and a test this week so I ve been stressed out. I haven't taken my chemistry test yet so I'm nervous about that. I have studied but I don't feel prepared. It's cold in our dorm room right now. It's cloudy outside which is how I feel about certain aspects in life. I'm not sure I will accomplish my goals in life. Though I know that if I give it my best effort that there is nothing more I could have done. No one is in the room other than me so I'm feeling a little lonely. Not too much though. Sometimes it is nice to be alone. I have always enjoyed being alone everynow and then. I feel like I need to relax. I didn't get tickets to the game this Saturday so I'm pissed about that. I did get tickets to the OU game though so that made me happy. I like to listen to music. It also helps me to relax. I'm listening to music right now as a matter of fact. I have a heavy course load, though not too bad. I know that if I quit that I'll regret it for the rest of my life. I think regret is probably one of the worst feelings in the world next to loneliness. Loneliness you could almost always fix, but regret is much harder to deal with. Time is going by too slowly, I think I'm running out of stuff to talk about. It does feel good to get your feelings out and onto something like paper. Sometimes I think it would be better to write out all your feelings on paper so that someone wouldn't have to sit there and listen to you bitch about your life all the time. But other times that's exactly what you need. My favorite TV show is Scrubs. The main character portrays me down to a T". Watching Scrubs is another way I relax. I'm not necessarily worried about my chemistry test, or at least not to the point of where I'm dreading going. I know that all I can do is my best. I know I've talked about this but I love music. I can feel it in my soul when it plays. I can feel the song. I can feel the notes, the rhythms, all of it. I can close my eyes and just get lost in a song. It's weird, I know. My time is almost up. I'm hungry. It seems like now that I'm thinking about how hungry I am that it is taking longer to finish than it did before. I'm writing this at 0:00 a. m. That's not necessarily early in my book but it is definitely too early to do this. I have a lot of reading to do. I'm happy to be at LOCNAME. It's what I have wanted to do all my life. I want to be a doctor. A heart surgeon actually. It seems like its going to be tough. Which is no surprise. I need to buckle down more. Next week, It starts. What is it you ask? It is me buckling down and going hardcore on my classes. 0 minutes left!  This was easier than I thought it would be. 0 minute left. I almost forgot to write this. That would have sucked and I would have been pissed. But I remembered so I happy. I feel better writing down all this. 
__label__label0 Right now I am really hungry. I would go eat right now but I am going to run with the marathon team tonight. I ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but I did not run during the summer. Lets hope I'm still in shape. Probably not, I'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again. This stream of consciousness in not fun. My thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type. It's like when I'm writing an english paper. I'll get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and I forget it. Good thing you aren't checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that. I hate typing on the computer, well not typing but talking on the computer. The I'M stuff instant messaging. My roommate keeps asking me questions while I'm doing the writing. She talks on I'M all the time. She spends more time in the room on the computer than I do and that's hard to do. She wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to. It's 0 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on. I never liked talking on I'M and I've tried to. I think many of the things I say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone. So I pissed of a few people even though I was being sarcastic. And it could be that I am quiet and don't talk that much unless it's about sports or something. I'm weird, I think I'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports. I have always liked to watch sports. And I pretty much know that I am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 0. I've always liked playing video games. Like right now I have Grand Theft Auto Vice City on my computer. It is a lot of fun. I love playing. I see it as a stress relief for me. When I had a hard day I'll start play the game run from the cops then feel better. I am able to do things in the game that I would never do in real life. I would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that's why I like to do it in the game because I can and will not get punished for it. The people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad. Even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional. All the cops look the same, all the pedestrians look the same. You can tell that this is not real life. If you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you. Now I know that does not happen in real life. There are clear distinctions between the game and real life. I know those distinctions and would not cross them. Some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun. 
__label__label0 Well I decided that I was going to go ahead and get this writing assignment out of my way. Actually, I was just looking for an excuse to put off my reading for my MIS course. I really dread reading that whenever I am finished with this because it is like 00 something pages long and I already have a bad headache. It's pounding as we speak. (or should I say as I type!) Wow, my nose itches a whole bunch. But I guess I would rather it itch than run. Earlier today I was on my way back to the dorms and allergies kicked in really bad. I hope I am not getting sick. That would really suck. I am really excited and nervous all at once about this weekend. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. I haven't seen him in like two weeks and it is probably going to be like a month before I get to see him again. He had his first baseball game today, I wonder how he did. Did he start? Did he hit well? I can't wait to talk to him tonight and get all the details. I'm excited about watching him play on Saturday. Baseball is his true love and I am really happy that he gets to fulfill his dreams by playing in college. However, I hate the idea of having to come home early on Sunday. My reasons for coming home are good, but I just wish I could spend more time in LOCNAME with him and not have to rush back. I mean, why does the dance team tryouts have to be this weekend of all weekends. Every other weekend that I have been here I have tried hard to find excuses and things to do and have had no luck at all except for staying out late and partying. I honestly wanted something productive to do. But now that I have decided to go out of town, they decide to hold dance team tryouts. And that would be what makes me nervous. I have always seemed to accomplish my goals and dreams, especially in the field of dance. But now I am going to be up against so many good girls and I just don't know what to do about that. I really hate the idea of rejection, but if I don't try then I'd never even know what would have came of it. PROPNAME is trying out too and it's going to be horrible living with someone who makes it if she does and I don't. Gosh, I really am nervous. What if they don't like my style or technique. I will be really depressed if I don't make it. I get embarrassed about stupid stuff like this. I wonder why that is. It shouldn't matter what happens, no one should care but me, but somehow I feel ashamed when I don't make things that I go out for. So I just finished balancing my checkbook and I really could use some more money. Sure mom and dad are paying for everything, but it would be nice to go out and do what I want to do when I want to do it and not have to rely on them. Speaking of money, my tuition bill says that I owe $000 and that is so not true. everything was paid and up to date and then I just decided yesterday to add a ballet course. However, the ballet course is only $00,,that is so not equal to $000. I wonder how long I have been writing for. Oh wow, it has already been 00 minutes! How come exercising doesn't seem to go this fast. I feel like when I am running on the treadmill that I have been going for like 00 minutes and it is actually only like 0 minutes or so. That's crazy. I shouldn't have ran the other night. My legs are so sore now and walking up and down these hills many times a day hasn't felt good on these sore muscles. Not to mention, I have had 0 dance classes since then and it is really hard to be limber and flexible when you are this sore. Now my lip itches. This music on television is horrible. I would get up and change the channel but I obviously cannot do that due to this assignment. I am starting to wonder about this course. The lectures are really interesting and class is fun. I have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part. But when it comes down to it, will I really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures. That sort of makes me nervous. The professor is really good and easy to listen to and understand, but I still seem to think that his tests will not so much be the same way. I have a feeling they will be very insightful and difficult and that stresses me out. I've come from a background of like all A's and I do realize things are going to be much harder now that I am in college, but I am not used to making much lower than an A. I am getting really sick of staring at this screen and my fingers are starting to cramp. My position is not very comfortable and I haven't moved in like 00 minutes. It is nice to have peace and quiet in here for once. My roommate seems to not care or respect me much. She likes to do what she wants to do and how and when she wants to do it. And that is fine and all, but when I am trying to sleep I think it's just a little rude when she comes in at like 0 in the morning and is all slamming doors and turning on lights, talking on the computer and on the phone! It's like, I haven't been sleeping very well as it is being in a new environment and all for the first time for this long of a time, then I finally get to sleep and she comes in and wakes me up. Then it takes me like another 00 minutes to fall back to sleep. Gosh I really hate that, but we have been friends for a long time and what do you say to someone like that? I wonder what my mom and dad are doing. I wish I could find PROPNAME's keys or at least find out what happened to them. I mean I just find it so awkward that they just disappeared. My dorm room is not that big and I can't seem to find them anywhere. I feel horrible about her having to take $000 out of her own check book to get an extra key made. Everytime I think about it, I start to get the idea that maybe I accidentally threw them away whenever I took at the trash. I'm thinking about sending her a check with part of the money because I feel so bad for her! Gosh this music on TV is horrible! I like one of her songs, but she just sounds horrible in concert. I don't know how much longer of this I can stand. My shoulders are starting to bother me. It doesn't help out that they were sore to begin with. Oh, something's popping up. I'm through!  
__label__label1 There is this annoying noise in the back ground that is driving me crazy. It's like a loud bell or ring. I am really frustrated right now because the internet doesn't work in my apartment, so I feel like I can't do much for school, which isn't really good, because I am addicted to the internet. My leg really, really, really hurts still, it's swollen and black and blue. It's making it really hard to walk around campus and to do my job at work. My head also hurts, but I don't know why. I am still tired from class this morning, waking up and going to calculus two at eight am is very hard for me, but that is what fit with my work schedule. College doesn't seem too hard for me, I guess it is because I am a person that likes to get all of her work done. I do feel that psychology will be one of my hardest classes because it is unlike any class I have ever taken. Calculus will be the easiest class because math is my strong point. Chemistry will take a little work, only because physics is my strong point, which would make sense, since it is going to be my major. The time seems to not go by as fast as I thought it would, and my head still hurts, but I think this time it hurts more because of that loud ringing in this computer lab. There seems to be too much going wrong and too much to think about right now. This is a very frustrating time in my life, and I just want to get through this fast enough to not cause me psychological harm and stress. I think my parents have lost their mind. I've been gone for a little over a week and they are having withdrawals. I was just there last saturday, and they only live thirty miles away, so it's not that hard to visit, I just don't have time and don't feel like I have to visit them all the time. Work is so boring, I actually dread going to work most of the time, mainly because some of the people are idiots and think they know everything, then they just screw up something and I have to fix it. My advice to anyone is to not have a job in retail, it's very stressful, especially if you are a perfectionist. Straightening tables and organizing clothes over and over, then watching it get messed up by uncaring customers can really drive you up the wall. If I sit here and think about how I am feeling, I realize how much my body is in pain from going to the lake this weekend. Jumping off cliffs into water, then climbing back up doesn't really do wonders at all for your muscles, especially when you have none. I was looking forward to moving out so much, and I am still enjoying it, but there seems to be something going wrong almost everyday. Not only does the internet not work, they haven't cleaned our carpets and repaired all the messed up parts of the apartment. It's stressful to think about all that needs to be done, and the amount of time left. Time is something I hate. I wish that some days had more time in them than others. When I was younger, all I wanted to do was grow up, I wanted the time to go by fast. Now that I am in college, I want time to slow down, and have some extra time. There is TOO much to do in so little time. My fingers have gotten cold, I wonder how that happened. You would think with the constant moving to type, they would be warm, but they are not. I would really think mine would be warm, I type to fast for my own good. Now I am running out of things to say, I can't think of anything to type. My neck hurts now from staring at the computer screen this long, and of course my leg really hurts because I am sitting on it. I really hope work goes by fast today, I hate the 0 to 00 shift, it's so boring, and it makes me feel like time goes on forever. Time needs to fly when I am in class and at work, but slow down when I am chilling with friends or doing homework. There is never enough time to do homework. When you think about it, you think ?there is plenty of time to read this paper? or something of the like, but when you start to read that paper, and work on the homework, you sometimes feel like you hardly get anything done. I just remembered that I need to read the next chapter for psychology. That's what I get when I start to randomly talk about topics that are odd, I slowly remember what I need to do, but that doesn't mean that in an hour or so I will remember what I just did. Stress causes ?brain farts? that allow you to forget something as important as homework and assignments. Unfortunately I get a lot of them, and that is sometimes why my grades are not perfect or close to perfect. I forget little details like dates (ok, that isn't real little, but you get the idea) and simple mistakes, ESPECIALLY in calculus. I make adding, subtracting, and multiplying errors in calculus. I can do anything in calculus, but adding and subtracting actually make me think if I don't have the calculator in front of me. That makes me sound dumb, but I am not, I just forget the little things and basics. Wow, the time has flown. 
__label__label0 So I'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. I feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but I wanted to get it over with. It think it's funny that you, Prof. PROPNAME, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. It must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my PSY000. My mom is always reminding me that I didn't take it in high school and that's what I get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. It shouldn't be a horrible class though. I can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. I love writing. I've been writing a summer journal for the past 00 years and I love it. I'd love to write for a living but I just do the journal thing well. I could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything I want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than I thought. it's only been 0 minutes and 00, 0 minutes, 0 minutes and 0 sec. ok I can't do that forever. what would happen if someone IMed me right now?  would I fail the assignment because I stopped writing?  I should have turned it off. yuck. I just burped. ew, I just wrote that I just burped. see, I had spaghetti for lunch and I can still taste it because the food sucks. I miss home all ready. I feel like a dork because I miss home, and I want to go home every weekend. I need to be social. I need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 0 minutes and 00 sec, 00, 00. ok I'll stop for real now. I am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't I?  I guess no one will know. why do I even care?  I keep switching in and out of I and I. capitals that is. I never do capitals when I'm typing on AIM so why should I do it now. I don't think it capital letters. !  well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. I hope this works because I don't have a printer that will verify that I actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, I live in san jac and I had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. I wouldn't talk to her even if I wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird!  I guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. I've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez I'm a  dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified I'd be. I just try to blend in everywhere. I know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, I would die of embarrassment. I'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, I miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from GR came down to hang out with him, and I got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. I'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and I don't. I guess I'm jealous?  I don't think so. I don't know. I wish he would just not nap right NOW when I could be talking to him. I can be mad about that right?  he COULD talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh        I'm kinda thirsty, can I stop to get a drink. I guess I can wait 00 minutes. HEY this is my favorite frank sinatra song. Luck be a lady. man I want to do a dance to this. I want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things I want to do at my wedding, but I wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me I'll be cut off when I get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. I wish money mattered a little to him. not a LOT but a little. I like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it?  oh geez, well, why does it matter?  you probably won't even read it. why would you read MY paper out of the 0000 people that you have in your classes?  0 more minutes. I'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but I got enough sleep. maybe I got too much sleep. I hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. I don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh!  my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 0 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. I want to go out tonight. I don't want to see major again and I don't really want to hang out with da, but I feel like I need to go out and do stuff. I'm really sick of eating  by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me?        lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, I'm a giant dork. WOW. how mortified I would be if you knew who I was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. I'd probably cry and run out. I've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. I really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. I had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and I had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. I hope you never read this, and I hope I get credit for it. all I ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. I would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 00, 00, self destruct,     ?        
__label__label1 I just woke up but I'm still sleepy. naps are so great! especially when you are sick. I can't believe that I've been sick all week long. I can't believe I missed that much class. I hope it's ok. I should be. college isn't like high school. thank God. there is so much more free time here. but I need to spend some of it studying. I'm nervous about all of my first tests! I hope I can handle them. I mean, I made good grades in high school but that is nothing compared to this level. oh well. grades can't be everything. if they were, I'd end up like my roommate. oh God. I've never met anyone like her. ever. how can anyone possibly be so boring? wow, speaking of the devil she just walked in! that always happens to me! everytime I talk about or mention someone they either walk up or call me. it's rather creepy. anyway. eww! I just remembered that we have geckos in our dorm room! it's so gross! well. they are actually kind of cute, but just not in my room. I need to take it out from under that cup before it suffocates. I would hate to kill it. poor thing is probably scared to death. either that or REALLY bored, I mean it's been in that small prison for a day now. but then again, my roommate sits in our small prison for days & never gets bored. I'm so mean. but it is seriously driving me insane! I mean give me a break, I walk in and she is just sitting there. no lights, no music, no TV. just staring at the wall. how creepy. but she doesn't mind. I mean I try to get her come places with me but she is never interested. oh well. whatever floats her boat. but what does? it seems that nothing does. I mean I can tell you I like this song or I like this food. she has nothing that she likes. nothing that she is passionate about. I do like this song actually. I like weezer. its somewhat mellow but not enough to make me want to sleep. a good transition from taking a nap to waking up. its perfect for right now. lyrics: lets go away for a while, you & I, to a strange & misty land. " I really need to take a trip to visit jeff, heather, & tim. I don't understand how all of my favorite people in the whole world all decide to disperse themselves across the nation just to go to school. I'm so jealous! heather gets to go to NYC just for the weekends! that is going to be awesome to go see her on thanksgiving. I really want to go see jeff in alabama too. I need to go watch one of his baseball games. he is so good! I am so proud of him! I'm sad that he isn't here though. I wish he was taller. I know if he was that he could definitely go pro. they say he has a chance even now! that is so great! that would be his dream come true. I hope he makes it. but I hope I still get to see him. I really miss him. I miss tim too. but what is in kentucky?  
__label__label1 I was just typing for like 0 minutes and all the stuff I just typed erased. So now I'm really pissed off. I was writing about my boyfriend and how I miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. I am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. I am so excited. I really don't like it up here I just have to deal with it and get used to it. I get so happy when I get to go home on the weekends. So you could say I am living for the weekends. That is bad I guess but I don't know, I just have to get used to it. I am talking to my friend right now. She is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. I wish she would just be herself all the time. I wish that some of my friends would come up here. I am ready to go home. I miss my family and especially my mother. She would comfort me right now. I need to read my bible. I am so bored right now. And I'm tired because I stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. I wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. I am so bored. My friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. I hate when she lies. She does that all the time. I wish she wouldn't do that. I wish my friend PROPNAME would come up here and go to college with me. I have already made up my mind that if I don't like it by the end of the semester I am going to transfer. I will try to stick it out though. I have calculus homework due Thursday and I am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems I don't know how to do. My calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. That is horrible. I can't wait till I get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and I will be able to understand stuff better. Dang!  I didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. I have like nine more minutes. I am so bored. As soon as I finish this I am going to sleep. No!  After I talk to my boyfriend. He is coming up here on the 00th and I can't wait. I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder what he is doing right now. My daddy gets on my nerves. He always has something smart to say. He can't never just let stuff be. I wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. I am really glad I have church members that care about me. I have received so many phone calls. It really encourages me to know that I have people praying for me. I have to keep reminding myself that I want to be a pharmacist and that I have to do what I have to do to get it. I am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and I will do good and that I won't fail any classes. I want to talk to my boyfriend now, but I am not going to call him until I finish this. Twenty minutes is long, and I didn't know it could be so long. I guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because If I didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. I really miss my mother. I'm about to read my bible, so I can gain some encouragement. I think I may call my mother before I go to bed or not. I need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that I am and accept my responsibility. I am about  to call my boyfriend. I love him and hope we get married right after I finish school, if we last that long. If not, I wish the best for him in life. But I think we would be good together. We are good together now. Except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. I can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. And my family. I'm ready to see everyone. I love being at home. I wish when I was in high school I didn't always want to leave home 
__label__label0 Wow 00 minutes of typing, that is cool. Man I lki this song. I wonder what other home work I have to do. ohh well this is cool, to bad I have already done this before. I liked my high school psychology class, it was fun. I wonder how I am going to do in this class. man it has only been two minutes. I don't know what my roommates infatuation with this 00 show. whatever floats his boat. wow running out of things to think about. man that rat, ejaculation thing that the doc talked about today was great, I was really intrigued. I wonder if that could work with women, if so I would be the man. I would make millions, because ugly people like me would be irresistible to hot ladies. wow that would be awesome!  ohh well it is only a dream, but I can dream can't I, yeah. I need to get better organized, maybe I'll call my house see if I can help them out. making fell thugged out , I'm felling on your booty. then hands up, get drunk throw your hands up. man r kelly is the man, to bad he is a pedophile. I think that is how you spell it?  twelve minutes to go baby. all right what is next?  I am going blank. I hope I can find some program to rid of these stupid pop up windows. they are so annoying. I want to find the people that create these and ring their necks. there are so many hot ladies here at ut. my classes are all right, they are not as easy as I pictured them, damn stone turn the tv down, I can hear it through my headphones. roommates, what can you do. naww I'm just playing he is really cool and he puts up with a lot of my crap. good man. what is thouing thouing?  r kelly you are a genius. why does my neck pop so much?  I think that I messed it up when I used to wrestle in high school. seven minutes to go. wow it has gone by pretty fast. I wonder if anyone is going to read this?  if so it will take them forever to read all of our essays. ohh well that is what they get paid to do. I ride spinners, I ride spinners. this song is off the hook man. all I need to do is get a crunk beat and repeat a word over and over, and I would make millions of dollars. I would be a rapper. they could call me whitey, or white coco. that would be hilarious. something like that. this is the way we ball. I had to change songs, the other one was messed up. three minutes to go. well this has been fun, its about midnight and I am a little tired. whatever. blah blah. I can't think of anything. crap. think, think. that think my brother did was great, I need to do it to someone. I gots ultimate practice tomorrow. I'm going to be dead. 00 seconds, man this was just enough 00 seconds, done! 
__label__label0 I can't believe she did that. She is supposed to be my suitemate, and my friend. She knows that I like him, and I thought I could trust her with my secret thoughts on him. Why did she have to run off and tell him everything I've said in the past 0 weeks? What kind of friend is that? Did she think she was helping the situation? The question that I've been asking myself for the past few days is, how do you know when you can trust someone?        Why can't people mind their own business? In all of my years so far, growing up with gossiping girls hasn't always been easy, but I always knew how to keep a secret. If someone can't trust you with their secret, how do you expect to trust them with yours? There was this old saying my friends and I used to repeat in junior high, Secrets secrets are no fun, secrets are for everyone. Secrets secrets are no fun, unless you let me in on one!" How true is that? I wish I could just take back everything I have said to her, knowing that she has run her mouth to the last person that needs to know my secrets. I can feel the tension between us building up slowly. When she asks me a question, I can hold back my answers because I still have some resentment towards her. Sometimes I even forget that I am supposed to be mad at her, and to make things worse, she doesn't know that I am mad at her. Mad isn't the correct word to describe my feelings; disappointed makes more sense. I met her through a mutual friend 0 years ago at a concert in LOCNAME. I thought that would be the last time I would ever see her, and those 00 minutes of conversation with her are blurred now. When our mutual friend informed me that she was attending the same school as me, and living in the same dorm as me, I thought that we should be suitemates and try living together. At first, we hit it off surprisingly well, doing everything together. It was like we had been best friends since elementary school! We are even rushing the same sorority. Can anyone tell me they have been in my difficult situation before? Well if you have, please write a manual for me to read on how to deal with lying suitemates/friends that you thought you could trust. What bothers me the most is that she doesn't know that I know what she is been doing behind my back. Everytime I would make a comment about the guy I'm into, or hang out with him and come back to my room glowing, we would sit down and talk and gossip about it. Why didn't I see it coming? Why couldn't I have known that she would betray my trust and run along and tell that guy everything I have been gushing about? It doesn't make any sense to me, because I have higher expectations in a friend than that. I expect a friend to respect my secrets, my wishes, and my personal life that doesn't involve them. I guess it's partly my fault for not watching what I say around her, like talking about things that I wouldn't want to get back to him. I guess it's partly my fault also, for trusting in her too fast. My roommate has been very supportive of the whole thing. She told me to just watch what I say around her, and to not say anything that I wouldn't want ANYONE else to know. It just hurts my feelings that she would gain my trust and then knock it down quick to the start. Maybe I shouldn't be so open with people I barely know. Maybe I shouldn't feel guilty, because ultimately it was her screw-up. Right? 
__label__label0 Wow, my mind goes blank when someone asks me what I'm thinking. It's really strange that that guy just stopped by. He is really friendly, but kind of creepy. He just comes in and talks to everybody. It's ok, I'm the same way; I'll sit and talk to anyone. Maybe I should close the door, so I won't get distracted; but then PROPNAME won't see that I'm here when he gets back. Oh well, he can knock. I'm so tired, but I don't think I can sleep tonight. It's so loud in our hall at night; I'll just have to start taking naps during the day when everyone is in class. Yeah right, rest?  I'm always in class; or studying. I spend more time studying than I spend in class; seems backwards. I can't wait until this weekend. Need to ask professor about ahhhh PROPNAME's calling. Need to go to admissions office and claim ORGNAME credit and change major. Need to ask PROPNAME about experiments. PROPNAME PROPNAME stops by, I'm kinda bored. This weekend will be fun; I haven't seen friends from home in a couple of weeks, so it'll be good to hang out with them. But what about PROPNAME?  I don't know how he is going to act now that we broke up. Should I tell him about PROPNAME?  Who cares?  I should call Uncle PROPNAME about kayaking; he really wants to go, and it will be a good stress reliever. Hope I have time; good memory. I think PROPNAME would really like it too. I don't really want to go home, haven't been gone long enough. Why wasn't anyone in the comp lab earlier to help me. Now I'll have to go again tomorrow. It's ok, tomorrow's easy. Can't wait to swim laps again; it's a good workout. I should keep lifting weights. I don't want to lose any more weight, but it would be nice to gain some muscle; I'll keep lifting weights. Oh, have to meet PROPNAME tomorrow for Cru. She is nice, I just don't know if I'll have time to meet in the small group regularly. That's terrible, I should never pick other things over Bible study. But I pray, and I should study on my own. I hope Annah starts going to church with me. LOCNAME eleven? Are they still in LOCNAME LOCNAME?  Is that where they went? I don't think so. Wow, this feels like when I'm working out and waiting for the twenty minutes to be up. I keep looking and the clock. Maybe I should put on some socks; these floors are really cold, and I think they're pretty dirty too. Yuck, who else has been barefoot here?  Where's PROPNAME, haven't seen her today. Where's my roommate?  She is always here. It's ok, this is nice. I need to go to the eye doctor, because I'm having trouble focusing. Glasses would be such a pain; I hope my vision gets better on its own. Will I have time to take Spanish every semester of college?  I hope so; it would be nice to be fluent. Very useful also if I work in LOCNAME. I have to stay in LOCNAME; it's too cold everywhere else. I love LOCNAME anyway. Austin too. It's so great to finally live here. And home isn't too far away. I'm not homesick yet. I just want my own bed. Jester beds suck. I have to be exhausted to get comfortable in them. I hope PROPNAME takes me out again soon. I had lots of fun with her. I need to spend time with PROPNAME too. I'm so glad we've been friends for so long. Even when we don't talk for a long time, she is always there. My eyes are tired. What's on tv?  Absolutely nothing interesting. Where's PROPNAME?  Maybe I'll call him. No, he is with a friend. He will call later. So many books, where to start?  Probably Spanish, I have that first. I need to stop eating so much candy. It's bad for my teeth and my body. Look, time's almost up. Yep, they're in LOCNAME LOCNAME, but only ten left. What's the point?  Who cares?  Does anybody pay attention anymore?  Did I ever?  Not me! 
__label__label0 Okay I am really clueless right now on what I am supposed to be doing. I'm pretty sure we're just supposed to write whatever is on our mind, but I've never had an assignment like this one so that seems really peculiar to me. My back kinda hurts, does that count?  Plus I'm wearing Christmas socks, they are white with red and green snowflakes, but I like them. Now I feel weird, like maybe I'm not doing the assignment right, I don't know what to put. I'm the type of person that always likes to have clear directions on what to do. Someone tells me to do something, and I do it. That way I know that what I'm doing is right. But oh well. I've missed two calculus classes in a row, and that is got me worried. I'm really aiming for a 0. 0. People would make ORGNAME as a school that is completely hard, and all u do is work. And that's partly true, I always find myself reading, and it takes me a full day to finish a math assignment. The weird thing is that I would never read in high school, so I thought it would be a major drag. Surprisingly it's not. I don't think it's that bad. Last night I was reading for economics, but I was too sleepy and nothing I was reading was sinking in. I set my alarm clock for 0:00, but it didn't go off so I missed calculus. That is got me worried. But I'm pretty sure that I'll do okay. Now I have 0 minutes and 00 seconds writing, still not too sure what I'm doing, still having my doubts. I think of so many things when I'm by myself, I go into my own little world and just think about anything and everything. But when I'm asked what I'm thinking, I go completely blank. And people think that I'm just holding things from them, that I'm keeping to myself. Maybe that's partly true, but I really do go blank a lot of times. My memory is really weird. I can remember the smallest most insignificant details about something, and then not remember something important that occurred. Okay I just noticed that when I started writing, I was sitting up straight. Now I am completely slouching, and now my back hurts. I don't know why I said that my back was hurting earlier, it really wasn't. Perhaps it was just because I had nothing to say. But now it really does hurt. I have back problems, last time I got an x-ray it showed that it was 00 or 00 degrees crooked. I don't remember which one it was. and that was a long time ago. I really should go again. Which reminds me, I need to go to a dentist too. I have not gone to a dentist in about 0 or 0 years. My parents go, but my sister and I have not gone. They told us to get the dental health plan here at LOCNAME. Do they even have that? I'm pretty sure they do, I'm just procrastinating. I'm not too consistent on my thoughts or actions. I give in really easily to things I wish I wouldn't. Oh well I'm sure I'm not the only one. Now 00 minutes and 00 seconds have gone by. A few more to write whatever it is that I'm thinking. And I went blank again. Well I started to notice my back again, so I decided to sit up straight. I want to go do laps in the swimming pool. I used to be in swimming when I was little, I was pretty good. I remember that I had a swim meet on my birthday, and I wasn't too happy about that. I hated competition. I hated going to swimming classes, to brownies, jazz dance, and especially karate. Tennis too. Its weird how when ur little, you hate going to all of these things that ur parents make u go to, but when ur older, u whish u would have stuck with them. I was also in gymnastics, but I think I kinda liked that. I remember the first time I had a swimming lesson, I was afraid to get in a pool, so my mom pushed me in. I have class in like 00 minutes, but its in this same building and hey, for this class as a matter of fact. Pretty damn convenient right?  Well now I've taken care of this assignment, I still need to read like 0 chapters for this class and another one for eco. But I don't even know what we're supposed to read. People told me the first 0 chapters, so I guess that is it. Anyways I'm done. 
__label__label1 A picture of my girlfriend PROPNAME sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. She is beautiful in many ways. Her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. I'll tell her that next time I talk to her. My cousin PROPNAME is getting married in October. He is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. When I asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. It should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. It'll be awesome. The wedding will be a lot of fun. I'll dance with PROPNAME and such. And I'll have all my family there. Well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. Too big. 00 first cousins, etc. I remember when my sister got married. Good times. I got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. My uncle (PROPNAME's dad) took a cool digital picture. My feet are cold. I'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because I don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. PROPNAME, my roommate is playing guitar. He is playing a solo that we recorded on PROPNAME PROPNAME' recording. We recorded and collaborated with PROPNAME. Good times. I hope he is happy with it. I'll ask him next time I'm in LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME is wonderful. I can't wait to see her next month. I hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. It should. And then I'll be able to embrace her like I did this past summer. What an amazing summer, all because I loved her like I should. Honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. We're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. Everything is willing. Everyday I see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. But PROPNAME and I are so far past that. And we both know it. And we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. I love her. I'm proud of that because I know I love better than most if you even call what most do love. PROPNAME and I are working on a new song. It's going to rock. PROPNAME, you're distracting me. Half over. 0:00 am. I need to read, but I'll do that tomorrow. He is still playing the guitar. He is asking me musical questions but I am busy. Stream of Consciousness! Yay. Homework. ORGNAME for school. Yahoo for me. *shrugs*" - billy madison. Great movie. I have it memorized and I recited it in front of PROPNAME in 0th grade when he challenged that I couldn't recite it. Good times. I wonder how PROPNAME's doing. He is probably smoking or drinking right now. What an admirable class president. PROPNAME was student body president. good guy. I'll see him on american idol one of these days. My neck itches and I scratched it. My calves are cold now. *stretching calves*  mmm. cow. Reminds me of steak. Yum. I could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools*  "Mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime" - homer simpson. It would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if I wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. But if I were a local vigilante, I'd hang out on Speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and I'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. "Bicycle dismount zone, punk!" heh. That's be cool. Then they would get up and beat me up. I remember when I use to spend the night at PROPNAME's house back in 0th,0th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. I never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time I saw one of those. they were  
__label__label1 I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. PROPNAME this song by PROPNAME PROPNAME reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. "  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  PROPNAME, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back PROPNAME. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 00?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over PROPNAME PROPNAME! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you PROPNAME. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. PROPNAME, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special PROPNAME was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor PROPNAME said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can PROPNAME be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive PROPNAME. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not PROPNAME that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having PROPNAME too. Hehe. 
__label__label0 hahaha, I really like the directions of how to tell PROPNAME PROPNAME our UT EID and such. I wonder if that is weird to him. PROPNAME is an interesting name, you don't here that every day. its a good thing there's a clock on here, I didn't look to see the time for this assignment. I don't really know what to think. I'm thirsty. my roommate needs to control the noise from her computer, its annoying. my face itches. there goes the noise again. I need to clean my side of the room. why do I have so many cords on my desk, but my roommate has maybe 0?  I think I have a rash on my arm, and it itches. I need to go return my nutrition book to the co-op. eew, a duck on tv has oil all over it. what is the purpose of this commercial?  DAWN?!  that's stupid. that girl from Everybody Loves PROPNAME is a spokesperson for too many things, and when I say too many, I mean 0 different companies. but that's still odd. to me. my arm still itches. I never did anything about being thirsty. wow, I never realized how long 00 minutes is. all of this was written in 0 min:00 sec. CRAZY!  is dr pennebaker really going to read this?  I wonder how many crazy people he has in his class thinking about obscure things. too bad I couldn't do this while I'm driving, I think of some really random things when I'm in the car by myself. I like alone time. I love driving home to LOCNAME by myself, PLENTY of thinking time. I need to go to ORGNAME. but I don't remember what for. hmm. why did I need to go?  this is going to bug me. I think I want to be a ORGNAME ORGNAME. the informational meeting is at 0 tonight. I wonder if I'll make it by the time I finish this. I just noticed that I capitalize random letters. well, they're not random because if it's capitalized, its supposed to be. but I don't capitalize everything that needs to be. so that's weird. I wish I could think of more interesting things. I miss my boyfriend travis. TV without sound is funny. mmhmm I love this bar, this song makes me laugh. I really do wish I were more entertaining for you dr. I love dr pepper. I wish I knew someone named dr pepper. my orthopedic dr is named dr payne. I had a teacher in high school named mrs payne. and mr axe. can you imagine what kind of torture my high school was?  no, I loved high school. I love the fact I'm out!  I still miss my boyfriend. I wonder how many times I think about him during the day. I should start keeping tally. nah, that would be a waste of ink. country singers make me laugh. MUCH cooler than pop stars - they're all stuck up. but man, country singers and music lovers. so funny. hahahaha, this music video is funny. I laugh at things easily. people like being friends with me because I laugh easily. it boosts their self confidence I think. my arm still itches. I wish that pretesting thing would work so I can start on that. that meeting is in 00 minutes. should I go?  yeah I'll go. 0 more minutes in this assignment. I still wish I were more interesting though. the guy in this video just poured a latte on himself. now my leg itches. I love the band LOCNAME. back to the arm. soooooo, basically this was filled with how my body itches. I bet that's interesting. there goes my head. what's with that?  I don't understand. I don't think I usually itch this much. I dunno, maybe I do. my stomach just made a noise. 00 more seconds. lalalalalalalalalala. and PROPNAME PROPNAME BAND rules! :) have a great day! 
__label__label1 Well, here I am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. I do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as I do. Lack of sleep, maybe. Laziness, probably. I consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects I always put it off until the last minute. I just got home tonight, its past midnight, and I am tired. I really want to go to sleep so I am not dead during classes tomorrow. I am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. This is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. Pretty much all my classes are going well, but I am not sure how I am going to study for exams. However, I think that if I keep up my study habits that got me here, I will do just fine. I am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and I do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. My eating habits worry me too now. Three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all I go for. My head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. I really love music. No matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. I enjoy all different kinds, and I have listen to a variety since I have started writing. It is quite weird now that I think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. I have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that I truly love. The whole college experience has been great so far. I love the campus, the professors, and the people. Most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. I almost look forward to each new school day now that I'm at the University. Being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that I wish I was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything. 
__label__label1 Well I'm sitting here wondering why I have to do this assignment. Should I type     correctly, capitalizing words. I don't normally when I chat on I'M or email someone. I really wonder if I'm ever going to get that song I'm practicing on the guitar. It's so     hard to hear the parts because there are so many other instruments, namely the     piano which is really getting in the way. Maybe I should try something simpler. but I get so bored with the simple stuff. I wonder if I can eventually get a PROPNAME     PROPNAME song or get to the point where I can just play something cool and everyone     recognizes it. Will I ever lead worship at a church? Who knows. I don't really think     that's my thing. there are so many cool people that do that already. In fact, I loved     Friday night worship at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really want to go back. I don't know     if Hope in the City is the church that the Lord wants me at, but I really like it. I love     how everyone is so friendly and genuine -- the worship is passionate, and I love     that. I walk in and go, this is how Christians SHOULD be. " not like the majority of     churches you walk into and see all the little cliques of friends, most of which are     too comfortable and exclusive to open up to a new type of person or just a person     in general. however, I know that there are some really cool places in LOCNAME that I     want to try: The LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. who knows. Oh, EV Free. Oh, I     saw court rode today. Man I love that girl. I hate that it's sometimes a struggle to     talk to her though. It's cool if we talk about the general stuff, but not normal enough     to just say whatever or something stupid because we haven't spent much time together. I mean, she is really cool, but she is a senior and has her own stuff, and I doubt that     she would ever just want to hang out with me. However, I should give myself some     credit -- I mean, she has called me and invited me to places (church, a cook-out. ),     so maybe she is interested in introducing me to some cool people. Cool people --     I'm finding some but still missing Steph and PROPNAME back home. Man I love them,     too. They're great. I miss being so comfortable with someone that you can just do     or say whatever's on your mind. or if nothing, you don't have to say anything, and     it's totally fine. I wonder how they're doing. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing in the     dorm, meeting new people, finding new good friends, like PROPNAME. I'm really     excited that PROPNAME is branching out and exploring ORGNAME, but I'm not ready for loss     of contact completely, and I don't think she is either. I think she wants to (as do I     and as does PROPNAME) "make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the     other gold. " I can deal with being silver, or bronze even, but I would like to keep a     place in her life. And man, I really want PROPNAME and I to stay the good friends     that we've become this summer. after PROPNAME's death. I love how she always     understood and felt the same way I felt. We agreed that we never knew what PROPNAME     was thinking but that we wanted to. PROPNAME -- man I miss her so much. Silver Taps     at ORGNAME is tonight, and I really want to drive back. I know I would miss Spanish in     the morning, but I just want to see my friends and talk about her and remember     her. I feel like things would be so different if she were still here: PROPNAME and I     would never have become as good of friends as we have because they would still be     hanging out all the time. They would still support and love me completely, of     course, but I think I would be more like PROPNAME -- really branching out and finding     new people. Plus, PROPNAME would have someone to chill with in LOCNAMEge LOCNAMEtion. PROPNAME is cool and all, but she has her own issues, and I really would like someone     there to keep PROPNAME accountable, to pay her the attention that she needs. because we all do! I would really like to find someone like me, but not too much,     and without a boyfriend (because the only cool girls I've found so far have boys. long-term boys, I think). I really want someone (a girl) that I can just play around     with -- be stupid and say stupid things, but also have fun and be silly. I want to be     able to plop down on her bed and either cry or laugh incredibly loud. Amazing, I     actually already have that. Do I need/want new friends other than camp friends     like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They love me so much and support me like crazy. They     like it when I'm around and like to spend time with me and hear about things with     me. especially PROPNAME. PROPNAME has got lots of other stuff that's she is doing --     which is cool -- but she just doesn't really have all the time for me. which I guess     sounds kinda selfish now that I've typed it out. But PROPNAME -- truly loving and     sincere and like a big sister. Just seeing her around campus encourages me and     makes me feel at ease. Not that I'm so uncomfortable here. I am SO GLAD that I     left College Station and A&M to come to LOCNAME and ORGNAME. What a blessing! this     place is amazing and fun and new and exciting but also is quickly becoming a     home. I find myself either almost getting lost or just finding new places or     directions or whatever to go around town, and I love it. I love being able to know     what street takes me somewhere else, or where my friends' houses are or where     to go shop or. whatever else. Friends' houses. the boys -- haven't talked to them,     want to see them. The girls -- looooved going over to their house the other night. I     got to chill with PROPNAME and tell her about school and life and etc while she shared     the same. PROPNAME and I also got to talk about Spirits and applications and all that jazz. Oh and I made it to the second round of the Texas Spirits app! Exciting. I can't     decide what I think about it though. I know who I am, and I just want to be myself,     but from what I hear and have seen, it might be like a sorority. Blah. I just don't     want to conform -- I want to be a part of something cool and unique but without     being stereotyped as something. I don't know. cookie-cutter, I guess. I hate that. I     want people to like me for who I am. stupid and crazy and silly and fun and smart     and perfectionist that likes crazy things and crazy music. crazy music -- ACL! And     PROPNAME is coming into town, and I just don't know what I think about that. Do I like     him? Does he like me? I have no idea. I don't think I'd ever date him. he is     younger and in Colle Sta and whatnot. But he is pretty great. I just have no idea. Ok well honestly I can't stop looking at the timer and how I have thirty seconds left. So I hope that I wasn't graded on capitalization or anything because I'm sure that I     messed up all over, but hey it's all good -- all we had to do was write this thing. I'm     confident. I'm happy. Class is cool. Don't want to take the tests 
__label__label1 First of all I really need to use the restroom but I also need to finish this. I've actually been thinking about this-whoa look at that timer- this experiment I don't really agree with because I am an awful typist and a perfectionist which makes this sort of painful. I am going to use this time as uh um um time to meditate. I needed  to do this monday- that psy webpage- oh I listening to everything its amazing -I keep on hearing my roommate peck at her computer-my sense are keen at this time because I just am hearing everything- this experiment is scary. I don't think I would feel comfortable if thoughts of sex or murder came into my head. I have trouble being blunt with God, how could I tell you. Who is you? That sounds like some black talk with makes me think of linguistics I love linguistic- PROPNAME in my office was the first I think I should change his name- PROPNAME in my office was the first to mention the stream of consciousness I was at a black poetry I got really mad because no one got there on time African American History. the light on my charger is red no, it green this experiment is longing my thoughts while I think so I have in essence to streams of consciousness- no I'm probably wrong. I felt like am in a mirror and another one is behind me and what you see- Is another ending process- my mind is so physical not in the sense of I like to look at hot boys but it just - am getting tired of-there is goes again that stupid delete- I was scratching my head now my neck itches. I guess this experiment is not so weird after all it is kind of like me. I never feel like I am living my like I think its because I am so analytical. that period and I an that an word I spelled wrong-I am getting on my own nerves can I please just spell. I am taking a breath when I'm not perfect I cause myself stress. I got sad last year when I finally found out that I was not perfect. I am looking into the computer as if I will remember that moment I sound like I am in a movie, so poetic, I am scrounding up my nose. I have a snob nose some people think it is cute. the question of beauty since I am doing this exercise for a minute I'm not going to care if I type right because I have to work On being perfect knoe one can be pertaect  that is only a bplare for Goreds hs is the perfect one I feel soreey Okay the message just came back up I don't have to type so bad now. My physically feels heavy why does feel and physically sound alike? My my teeth taste salty I ate some how do you spell pretzels I think the imprint of the desk is in my arms. I just scratched my head I wonder what kind of people go after the 00 minutes, nerds sick demented people I no that can't be the case then I would fall into that category and I can't have that even though I feel like a nerd. People tell me I am pretty, but down inside I feel Like a nerd. This reminds me of that ORGNAME will anybody every read this e-mail does it really even matter. I want to go back to my movie but I am being pulled lead in another direction. Hopefully it is God. I need God the time is 0:00 pero mi clock is fast a couple of minutes. I quit in essence monday. I wouldn't just walk away I gave my boss notice that the weight of school and job are too much. I really want to focus I my life with God Life with God what does that mean. I am ready to know God. I am happy for the things He gives me pero I desire him more than the things I think that is maturity when children start to think what they can so for their parents instead of vice versus I this experiment has revealed in me my fear I leaving this world without an impact. I not trying to confess fear. Just want to know I guess my life meant something. I hope this class will bring my closer to God. I just got to belief that what I feel is just more than chemicals in my brain. I am ending it here though I am tempted to write a song. though I have never written a some I have put down- PROPNAME PROPNAME- I have to read her poems she seems like a shady character. what can I say of her character I didn't or don't even know her. Ok Ok goodbye     
__label__label0 Ready, set, go. Wow, my grammar has gotten pretty bad. I wonder if this thing has, I hate these stupid pop ups, spell check. I just woke up, feel pretty worthless. Saw PROPNAME PROPNAME played to the Wizard of Oz last night pretty cool probably cooler if I was stoned. Only been stoned once before, didn't like it, no desire to do it again. I'm a beer girl. Need to work out, clothes don't fit as well as they use to. PROPNAME won't like that. I'm glad PROPNAME is coming this weekend I hope she has fun. I really miss my family, I hope my sister can can, Fuck these pop ups, come up next weekend for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't know where anyone went, they're probably eating lunch. Damn, 00 more minutes, I don't really know what else to write about, maybe or is maybe if I turn on some music. This is one of my favorite songs, I like it better than the original, I think it was remade for Good Will Hunting, it makes me feel so. I don't know, introspective. Bad word, but can't think of anything else. I love words, probably the only reason I did well on the SAT. Damn I'm still so tired, don't know why, must have slept for at least twelve hours. I think I might be getting sick. Spring break best vacation of my whole life, some of my favorite memories. Memories are an odd thing. I wonder why you remember the things you do. Walked into the ORGNAME building the other day and the smell of it-deja vu-it was such an odd feeling, and I can't quite pin point what it reminded me of. I wish I knew. LOCNAME vu is such a weird thing I knew more about it- what triggers it and everything, maybe some day. 
__label__label1 OK, I have writer's block. I guess I'll think of this assignment as a diary. Today was a pretty interesting day. I met a lot of people who spoke Spanish, so that made me feel more at home. This stupid bracelet is bothering me. I miss PROPNAME, my ex-boyfriend. I wonder if anyone's going to read this nonsense, and who ever is reading this, I feel sorry for them. I'm not that cool in my head. My room mate is gone. She is bowling. I wonder what she is doing. Maybe sitting there bored. She is always bored everywhere we go she has this face, that makes me bored. I miss my family, even though when I'm there I don't really talk to them. I guess I'm just used to them being around. I wonder if I'm prone to meningitis? Should I get the shot?  Knowing my luck, if I don't get, I'll be well, to dead in 00 hours. I'm scared of needles. Damn, I'm scared of everything!    Oh, crap almost erased everything I had written. Computers are not for me. What is for me?  I like Psychology. The lectures are super interesting. Do I have any better word?  Nah, interesting is an OK word. I feel so non-intellectual. See, that just shows my inability to express myself in words. Physically I'm very expressive. But I that's what I think. My ex probably doesn't think so. No, he does. I miss reading in U. I. L. I just realized that being in college makes you miss a lot of things. I wonder if I'm going to make it out of here?  Sometimes I meet people just like me and tell myself, don't worry you're not alone, but other times people are so articulate in class it intimidates me. I set a goal for myself when I first got here and I can't do it. I'm suppose to ask at least one question per class per week. But I just can't with all those people staring at me. Once I open my mouth, they're going to realize what an idiot I am. This sounds so cliché. Other people probably wrote all these philosophical questions on their stream of consciousness, like Why are we here? Did PROPNAME believe that as humans. Well, I don't write like that. I'm just a bundle of unanswered questions. Ahhh, my back's starting to hurt. I like that guy who walked me to my room. Is that all were suppose to write. OK never mind. That girl from LOCNAME is really nice. She reminds me of a friend from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I hope I meet more people like her. It'll help me sleep better. I've had really bad insomnia. I could be depressed or just a freshman in LOCNAME. Maybe both. I don't get what happened to my first letter in every sentence. It disappeared into the left side. What did I push?  OK 00 seconds left. I'm so glad I'm almost done with my first assignment. Is this what he wanted?  I hope I did this right. Bye. 
__label__label0 I didn't know there was a timer on  this thing. This is kinda weird typing all my thoughts. My ring is broken. My ice cream is really good. That place down stairs has good ice cream. I'm tired. I need to go look for a new job today. I am going to 0 different Chili's to apply. I like my mousepad. My roommate just came in and it scared me. She just turned on the water. I'm thirsty. This ice cream is making me thirsty. I want to go home today. I miss my friends and family. But I'm not going to go home today. I am going to stay here. 00 minutes of writing your thoughts is a lot of time. which means a lot of thoughts. I have to read like 0 chapters for oceanography because I keep forgetting to read. So now I'm really really behind. I need to catch up so I don't fail. I need to go to the grocery and get some more food and drinks for in here. I'm almost out of Cokes because I go through them so fast. My roommate is talking to me about laundry. I haven't done laundry here yet. I went home last time to do it (to LOCNAME LOCNAME). She said the washing machines are really small and the dryers are really big. We just swept in here. It gets dirty pretty fast. And you don't even notice. I want a College of ORGNAME t-shirt. I saw one today but it was for the education council. and I don't think I want to join that. I don't like "counseling" haha. But really I don't like speaking in front of people or anything. So I'm sure that would not be fun for me. But-I don't know what I am talking about right now. PROPNAME just came online. Yay. He must have just woken up. It's kinda late. But he wakes up late. That's ok though. I wish I could sleep late. I have classes too early to sleep late. It's kinda weird because I don't like to go to bed early. So it would be really good if I had late classes. Education ORGNAME sounds like you just bond with the teachers and stuff. Like student council. So yeah-not for me. I like PROPNAME. I have not seen him in a while. I also have not seen PROPNAME PROPNAME in a while. My phone is ringing. Stop ringing. It's PROPNAME. I have not talked to him in forever. PROPNAME likes her pants. I have some like those. I got them from Target. I want to go shopping. I don't have any money though. I saw ORGNAME's sister in class the other day and I didn't know if it was her. So I didn't know whether or not I should say hi. But she had her eyebrow pierced so I didn't say hi. And I told PROPNAME that and she said I was lucky that I didn't say hi to her because she would have been really mean to me. That sucks. I don't like mean people. I hate making friends. It's so hard to be able to tell who your real friends are or not. I don't really have any friends here yet. I met one guy. And I have a few other friends who I see off and on. But still. All my friends left. Which is not very cool. I want to burn a CD. I have a whole bunch left. I need to renew my internet service. It doesn't expire til Sept. 00rd though. I need to look for those blue books. My spanish teacher said we need some for monday. And I have some because PROPNAME gave them to me. The lawns outside must be getting mowed. I hear a lawn mower. Anywho PROPNAME needs a blue book so I need to find them so I can give her one. So yeah. I like the pictures in my room. They remind me of my friends. I miss them. PROPNAME is having a lot of fun I think. She has 0 roommates but they all share an entire floor. And there are 0 bedrooms and 0 bathrooms and a living room and everything. That would be cool. I wish I had money to buy that here. But next year I am getting an apartment with PROPNAME I think. She wants to get fish but I don't like fish. They die too easily. PROPNAME gave me a big LOCNAME poster. She knows that I hate museums and stuff like that and she went to the PROPNAME PROPNAME museum with her family and got me that poster. To be funny. So now I'm going to put pictures of my friends like riding the horses and stuff. I just realized that my psych class is not 0 hours long. It's only 0 and a half hours. I just thought we got let out early all the time. 00 minutes is a long time. Although it seems a lot shorter when you type everything you're thinking. But that's still a lot of thoughts. I would hate to grade these things. Almost over. Only 00 seconds left. I want more ice cream so hurry up and finish. I need to get a new pencil sharpener. 
__label__label1 sick nose running I feel like shit I think being sick makes me look ugly. I hate when I feel ugly especially in psychology class where there are so many beautiful girls they're all so different amazing I have a lot of anger in me sleep deprivation is getting to me gentle breeze made by a rickety fan in my room ac is not working like it should 00 years old I'm thinking what a dance club would be like I want to play guitar when this is over I wonder if playing can compensate for the lack of female companionship. I have tried, it all I think about. blinds dirty lips a little dry eyes burning butt getting tired would it feel that way if you got laid? wonder who came up with that word. fight club I wonder if tupac shakur could have played tyler durden's role, that is if PROPNAME PROPNAME's character was black. its friday and I don't have many things to do I think of what a date would be like. sometimes I can't believe how hard college dating is I mean is not this time about exploration so why do girls hold back so much. I don't know, it very important to me for some reason I wonder if you look better when you're sick or just like that sickly? this exercise is not free flowing as I thought it would be, I want to type continuously but can't I have to pause and formulate my thoughts into words, sucks I have so many abstract thoughts not thought in words, see I was hoping to excel in this too because psychoanalysis was a career field I was into. being good at this kind of exercise without practice would give me a flash of brilliance I hate looking out the window I feel like an old man depressed about life contemplating I have a strong sexual urge in me right now, I want to make love to a girl not sex I want to pride myself in the fact that I'm a rare college guy who can make love and not just have sex or get laid. I think about when girls smiled at me or were attracted to me, does that necessarily mean there is sexual chemistry. in my thoughts, yes. but real sex is different from thoughts, too many details you forget when you think about it. there are so many girls I want to get with at my 000 person psy class but I still have not and probably won't. I wonder how that affects me, especially on an unconscious level. maybe it translates into a low self opinion because I think that every girl thinks I'm ugly. how do I get over that negativity. is there a way to feel good, even if you don't get girls? can someone that does not have what someone else has, can they be as happy as that person?  my sexual thoughts are gone now, I'm still sick, about to sneeze, wow my thoughts are a lot more free flowing now, I have not stopped typing for about 0 minutes. I think I see it now, I'm getting deeper into my unconscious or preconscious maybe I'm thinking of all the girls that walk by. do they know, that if they snap their fingers, they can have any guy they wanted, what power. makes me wonder how I should deal with them. I think it would be very hard to get with them sexually because they all want something very specific. I thought about listening to music while doing this, but for the first 0 minutes I have found that it limits your thoughts to the subject matter and emotion of the song. I would rather get in touch with myself and hopefully have this analyzed and see what it means. next thing I want to do is free word association although not sure what it is. thoughts of mine still not as deep I thought, oh well 
__label__label1 Well here we go. I'm so tired I really don't feel like doing this. But I only have one day left so I guess it'll be good to get it over and done with. I haven't even started reading yet. I really need to start. God I'm hungry. I can't believe all I've eaten today is some bagel bites. I need to go hit up the grocery store tomorrow and stock up on some food. I'm so happy it's Thursday. This week dragged on for so long. It's probably because this was the first week where we had class on Monday. This music that I'm playing in the background is really effecting my stream of consciousness. I think I'll change the song to something more mellow because this song I'm listening to right now sucks. That's better. I wonder what's going on tonight. I think after I'm done typing up this paper I'll call up PROPNAME (my cousin). Whoa he just I'M'd me. That was weird. I should probably tell him that I'm working on something because I don't think I can do both things at once. I can't wait to go back home and visit. I've been feeling kind of homesick lately. I wonder what all my friends in LOCNAME are doing right now. Probably nothing. LOCNAME is so boring. I kind of need to go to the bathroom. But I have to finish typing this paper. I guess I have to wait. I think I'll go back to LOCNAME next week and see what's up with everybody. Man, my stomach's starting to feel all queasy. I should go eat something. I can't wait to DJ on that boat in a couple of weeks. I hope I don't get sick before then. Everyone's been getting sick lately. I slept a lot today. I need to go out and do something tonight now that I'm all rested up. There are way too many chairs in this room. Whoa my keyboard is vibrating. That felt weird. I wonder what's making it do that. It must be something outside. This CD I'm playing is so stupid. The song just finished and now I've been hearing crickets chirping in the background of the silent song for like two minutes. Awesome it's over. Man, the whole CD's over. I should put in a new one. I hate working in silence. Or wait a minute; I remember the stream of thought instruction thing saying that one of the things you should describe is what you hear. Right now all I hear is car's driving by from the outside of the balcony. That's pretty boring. I think I'll bump some 0Pac. When I go home for the weekend I need to make sure to stock up on some food. I think I need some soap too. Maybe I should make a list. Sweet, only six more minutes to go. This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm already almost finished. Why are my eyes so red. They've been red for like the past 0 days. I bet it's those stupid contact lenses. They're so crappy. I think I'm just going to have that Lasik eye surgery. I wonder if I spelt that right. I don't think it really matters. My stream of consciousness can't spell all that well. I think after this I'll look up the bus schedule so I won't have to walk half an hour to my class tomorrow. I hate walking that far. And I have flat feet too so all this walking is really starting to suck. I guess it's good for me. Only two minutes to go. Man, I keep on having to think of my stream of consciousness. Maybe that's a bad thing. I have a blank stream of consciousness. That can't be good. I guess it's better than those people who are constantly thinking. I bet I'd be really good at meditating since my mind goes blank so much. I wonder if there's any classes on that. I want to take that Kapawaya class. That'd be cool. I'd learn how to fight and break dance simultaneously. I don't see how they expect to teach you such a complex fighting style in 0 days. That's pretty stupid. I   
__label__label1 words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     LOCNAME at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 0th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right PROPNAME?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. "  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. 
__label__label1 My head hurts so bad right now, why. I need more tea, I'm thirsty. what do I have to do tomorrow. bio. lab, lots of reading. that sucks, I wonder how many pages I actually have to read, like 0 chapters. ew. I need to turn in this form to the health office, actually I'm not sure where I need to turn it into, I should call PROPNAME and find out. I wish I had frozen yogurt right now. I need a job. where are my roommates are. my head hurts so bad right now. I need to get one of those egg crate things for my bed, I think that'll help my back, I'm so tired, I need to take a nap. I need to do homework. I should call my mom later and tell her about the stress causes immune suppression thing, what's my brother is doing. I should call my dad too, I haven't talked to him like four weeks. I need to send him the letter I wrote. wow, my head really hurts. I should call PROPNAME and see if she is going to be in LOCNAME LOCNAME this weekend. I wonder why her and her boyfriend broke up, he is a jerk, oh well. I need to call PROPNAME and tell her to buy me a gift for PROPNAME's birthday this weekend. I wish it was my birthday, I need a vacation already. how many tests I have next week. PROPNAME's coming next week, what time does his flight come in, I should call him tonight and find out. what time does he get off work, I need to find a nice place for us to eat, what's on sixth street, I should call PROPNAME she had know. I need to clean my room before friday. yesterday was grandparents day I think, I need to call my grandma. I want to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME for the winter break. I'm so tired right now. Sept. 00 is this week, wow, that is like two years, goodness. wow. I need to go to the grocery store. oh yay, PROPNAME's home. this should be fun, except not at all, I wonder if she is driving to class tomorrow, I should get a ride, I hate riding the bus. I hate standing up on the bus. I think it should be a rule that if you're a boy you have to stand up for girls on the bus. my first class is at 00 in the morning. I have so much to read. did I take my medicine this morning. I think. I can't believe how much I forget lately, I need to get that checked out. PROPNAME's team is playing us in a volleyball tournament this weekend, I should call her and see what time so I can go watch, PROPNAME is coming in this weekend. oh, that's going to be so much fun. we should go downtown. I need money. I need a job, I wonder if I can get a job here at the apartment complex, I bet that'd lower my rent. all of a sudden I stopped capitalizing my I's . I think it makes me type faster. that's neat, I love my smell-good candle, my head hurts, how long does advil take to work, I need to go check my mail . when's our electric bill due? I'm hungry, what did I eat today. I need to buy more milk and sweet n low. I'm not going to the grocery store till sunday, oh, I have to get my film developed before monday, I should take it to one hour photo, at the grocery store. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing, I should go chill with her instead of reading for bio. discussion. I need to clean my room and do laundry before this weekend, oh my stomach hurts too. I wonder if I took my ulcer medicine this morning, I need to get my prescription filled. I have to go register to vote in LOCNAME this week, or next week maybe. oh my gosh my head is killing me this sucks. oh my 00 minutes are up. 
__label__label1 Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment. At least its easy, right? Oh well. I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am I going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. I really like this new piebald cd. its happy. I hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. I think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. I need to read more. especially for school. I just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. I'm tired, I should go to sleep. but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no 
__label__label1 Here I sit in the Jester computer lab, wishing that I didn't have to     be here. Why don't I have a computer, better yet, why don't I have a     friend that will let me use their computers? College is not like what I     thought it would be. It definitely is as hard as I thought it might be,     school work wise, but I thought that the friends part would come     easily. I have spent 00 years of my life living overseas with     americans. It was a military base in LOCNAME. The people in LOCNAME     schools systems are incomparable to the people in LOCNAME. They     are open-minded and excepting. I was raised to believe that all     man-kind was this way. I figured than when I got to college I would     miss my old friends, but be glad to meet some more great people in     this world. But here I sit, in this lab, alone. It's not like what I     expected, and worse than I ever thought. I walk around alone, and     although there are worse things,  I use to be known for being loud     and fun. I was the person that everybody knew, and everybody liked. I was somebody on my tiny base, and in my little high school of a     hundred people. But here, I am another face in the crowd. Of     course I didn't expect college to be just like LOCNAME (where my base     was), but I didn't expect to have no friends at all. People haven't even     given me a chance here. I'm just hoping that things get better. They     say that everybody has the same fears that I do, but then I see a ton     of people hanging out with friends. Not everybody is in my boat, all     of my friends are either across the LOCNAME LOCNAME, or at least in     another state. I don't want to be a pessimist, and I definitely don't     want to dwell on the bad, but it gets difficult when everything that I do     everyday is a reminder that I am alone. And here I sit in the     computer room typing this thing, not because there isn't a computer     in my room, but because it is my room mate's, and she won't let me     use it. I let her use anything of mine, I don't even understand how     people can actually be so stingy and be okay with themselves. My     friends have always come before my possessions, and people's     feelings have always come first, and I always know when somebody     is feeling down, and I have always tried to help them. I am waiting     for that what goes around, comes around" saying to come into     action for me. Also, I had decided to be a teacher overseas for my     life anyways, have my children grow up like me. This has at least     cemented my life goals for me. My children are definitely growing up     in a military school overseas. The people there are very warm and     accepting, and living among cultures makes everyone open-minded. I don't like the way that the people act here, and most of them don't     even realize what they are missing in this world. They just turn up     their noses and avoid people who are different, and don't like any     kind of changes. I have been through two evacuations from my     base, and I was just fine. I think that I can probably handle a lot     more than other people, and had they been stuck in a situation like     mine, a new place with nobody that they know, they might be feeling     just like me. But I do know that I will get over this, and I will feel even     more blessed to see my friends and live back overseas; and I will be     positive that I am doing the right thing when I give the life to my     children that I had growing up. I think that it shaped my character in     a good way, and if anybody here were open-minded and accepting     enough to talk to me, maybe they would understand that as well. anyways, I'm back, still here in this lab on this same computer. I'm     still here in this school with no body that I know. People keep on     coming in and out. Do they maybe feel like I do? It is so weird to be     standing in a crowd of more than 000 people, and not knowing     anybody's name. But that is 000 people that I could get to know if     they gave me the chance. That thought use to make me happy, now     I hate the idea. I miss my old life. But I wonder, if I feel like this,     there has to be at least one other person that feels like me. One     other person who feels like they don't know anybody. That thought     doesn't make me happy, but optimistic that maybe I will be able to     meet people sometime. In the mean time, I am thankful for all of the     true friendships that I made during my time spent else where, and I     am glad that I at least have a loving family and friends to pick up the     phone and call, no matter how far they may reside from me, I know     that they care. I no that no matter how alone I am on campus, I am     not alone in the world, and every night I go to sleep thinking of my     friends, and smiling. And I know that in my four or five years here, I     will at least make one friend. Maybe even tomorrow, so I'm just going     to stop stressing about today, and pick up the phone and call a loved     one for now. 
__label__label1 Right now, I am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small. I am waiting for a phone call that is so important, and if I don't get it, I am going to feel like a really big loser. Yes, I did just get all the blessings I could ever ask for, so I am selfish to be wanting more, but its something I really really want. All I want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about. I have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best, and I get so sick when I let myself down. Rejection sucks. its so hot in here, and as all my friends call because they just got the call," I feel like a loser. I am proud of myself- but rejection is not something I handle well? What if the call does not come-- will I cry, will I blame my inabilities on something else, how will I react? The anxiety I feel right now is extreme. On top of all that, I am homesick. I have a great life here in LOCNAME, but since my family is a huge part of my life, I feel kind of left out being so far away. Everything back home seems to go on without me. my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on. she follows me around and sometimes I feel used because she really does not know people here. She is not in a sorority and so sometimes I feel as if she is angry at me for that. I am so anxious. my boyfriend is supportive too, but I wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me. Yes, I know about his fear of commitment and all that crap, but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him. Oh, that stupid seventh heaven song. turn off the dang tv. All I want is peace and quiet without all the noise. Oh, and I have to worry about yesterday too. My sorority is awesome, but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them. Yes, I know. Its silly if we all drink together. But, sometimes I feel as if I have this image that I have to uphold. and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life. my family, my faith, my school, my friends. How do I act? How do I dress? Who do I associate myself with? All of these things constantly flood my brain, and sometimes all I want to do is get far away from those thoughts. Do people love me for me? Do they love me for who I am here or the grades I make or the house I live in or the money my parents make? How do people view me? And that tv, always on. what I would give for that chatter to stop for 00 minutes. I can't even study with the noise. I am worried about this year. I need a job, I have bills to pay, I am in hard classes. how will I measure up? I love my life, I love my life. but I could seriously do without the stress. I am determined, and I already have accomplished so much this semester, but will it end? I want it to stay this way, but there is so much to lose. I am scared that I will lose it. How do I not lose it? I pray all the time, and I count my blessings. its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint. why did I choose to live in an apartment with a girl I don't like? What possessed me to do this? Did I feel independent and like a big girl? Now I feel young and naive, and way out of my league. oh, the insanity, but good things come to those who wait and I put all my trust into a higher being so things WILL work out. 
__label__label0 I've never sat here like this before and jotted down my thoughts. Despite them being my thoughts, I don't think much about them. Every time I hear my roommate, PROPNAME, play the saxophone, I think of my brother PROPNAME back at home. (I thought of this because he is practicing on it now. )  School. This year I'm trying to make straight A's because I crashed and burned my 0st two semesters. Some say it wasn't really a crash and burn. I received a 0. 0 PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME's definitely not what I was aiming at. I don't know what's wrong though. I set aside a lot of time to study, but I could just never pull through on tests. Some people suggested I have ADD. I always think about whether or not I have ADD. I've usually dismiss the possibility that I do, because that might be just the easy" way out. What if it's not ADD?  Just me having bad study habits. I don't know. I always worry about school. 'm going to see a counselor about it. Crew. I can't wait 'till tomorrow morning. We have another practice with Texas Rowing Crew bright and early in the morning. 0:00 practice that is. I found seven people that are trying out for crew too that are living in my apartment complex. In one building over no less. Heather just left. I just got back from dropping her off. Heather's my girlfriend of 0 yrs going on 0. She plays goaltender on the ORGNAME ORGNAME girls soccer team and is having a tournament in LOCNAME for the weekend, getting back late Sunday night. PROPNAME stopped, and is now watching television in the living room. I think that is one reason I can hardly get any studying done in this apartment. There are too many distractions. Plus my bed is so comfortable. Having to wake up so early sort of makes me tired. I learned today that people with a regular sleep cycle tend to have better concentrations than do people with a sporadic sleep cycle. That's what I have. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I wake up at 0:00 and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, I wake up at 0:00. I never gave much attention to my sleeping habits, but now I'm taking a study strategies course that is hopefully going to help me make better grades. I want to make straight A's this semester because in doing so, it will raise my G. P. A. to a 0. 0. Still no where near where I want to be, but its a start in the right direction. 00 more minutes. Speaking of sleepiness, I am feeling very, very sleepy right now. My eyes are getting heavy and my head is tilting. But I'm fighting it because I am in the middle of an assignment. I just looked at Professor PROPNAME's old tests and I do not remember going over some of those things in the book or in lecture. I hope that there was a different curriculum last year. Psychology is the only class I'm all too worried about. I feel like I have no control in this class. I feel like this class overburdens me. I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 0 classes. I'm a 00 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes. I'm getting even more and more tired than ever. I will definitely nap after this writing assignment. My glasses are bothering me and my throat is so dry. My brain is going on hold for a second as I take a swig of water. Ok. I bought one of those Nalgene water bottles. What's the deal with those anyway?  They make them so expensive, and I see everybody has one. So, naturally, I had to get one for myself. Two more minutes. I am counting down this assignment to be over because I'm just that tired. I am assuming their will be some sort of punishment to press the finish button early, so I stop myself from doing that. Wow, 00 seconds. I am very ready to take a nap. 00 seconds. Almost there. Man, I'm going to have to get PROPNAME to shut that TV up when I

__label__label0 I am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to ORGNAME channel. It's playing justin timberlake song. I just got back from my biochemistry I class and the professor in that class seems very boring. I noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because I feel like I missed a lot of what he said while I was taking notes. I can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time. I feel I'm more of a single tasked person. Besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and I can hear it's boiling right now and I think I need to check on it before the water boils over. I'll be back. Well, I'm back. This week will be a tiring week for me since I have so much to catch up with anthropology reading. I pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means I have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks. My other teachers are okay and I seem to absorb a lot in their lectures. I don't think I can work out much this week and I maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday. Plans for weekends are unsure since I haven't made any. Hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to. I had already met some people in my dorm, but I haven't really met people in my classes. I also met the people from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and I don't think I can usher again in the football for the Longhorn PRe-Pharmacy since I haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago. I hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible. It's unexpected that somehow right now I feel more energetic than when I was about an hour ago when I was in biochemistry class. Maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that I ate about 0 hours ago now is starting kick in. Something about the song in ORGNAME just made me looked at the screen. It's PROPNAME PROPNAME in a Japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because I am from an asian culture. In LOCNAME, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often. As I'm watching a fighting scene in that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I think LOCNAME has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art. Instead, we have other things. I don't feel like listing  them right now. It's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows LOCNAME is diverse and multi culture. Speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture. I have a lot to read on The Forest People, who are people have very different culture from Western and Eastern culture. The book is  
__label__label0 Well, I have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so I guess I should start working on it now. It's a thursday afternoon and all I'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. What a life! These stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. Let's see, I've been up here for about a month now, and I have yet been able to see and fun" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. It's not that I want to be partying everyday, still I would like to see what's all the fuss's about. Then again, my life here at the apartment is great. I live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them I would be bored out of my mind. These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. I'm hungry, yet I don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? Of course not! It's because I have to sit here for 00 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. During the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to UT, so during the day they're at the campus. Maybe I should spend more time at the campus. Maybe that would help me get to know more people. I haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that I see in class everyday, those that I greet with a casual hello; however, I don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. My computer desk keeps on shaking while I'm typing this, I should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? This place is so cramped. Luckily, this weekend I'm going back home to LOCNAME to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. I miss my family very much, especially my dad. He have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. Now, I have to be on my own, that's the only way that I will learn to grow up. I know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what I'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how I'm doing in school, wondering how late I sleep, wondering how many times I eat in a day, etc. I know he worries, but the best I can do is call him every night just to let him know that I'm doing fine. I can't go back home, if I live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then I will never learn to grow up. I miss my mom too, but I'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. The buses hear run pretty frequently, I just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. My roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. I'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. My other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. It's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. Oh yea, ORGNAME meeting is today, maybe I will get to know more people. Then again, I doubt it because I'm always quiet and reserved so I guess I won't talk much. Well, I'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. After this, I'm going to head to class, then it's ORGNAME meeting. 
__label__label1 I'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring,       I wish I had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe      if I turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. I don't know how I'm going to     be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. I can't help but stare at the     posters to kill time. I'm particularly fond the print of PROPNAME's sunset at LOCNAME. There are so many things I'd rather be doing right now, like watching TV or sleeping. Well I'd much rather this have been a 0 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 0 minutes has lapsed. I wonder     just how many of these the professor/TA's actually read. I know I wouldn't want to have to read any of these. Hopefully I did well on my biology test I took today. Tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. I still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which I will more than likely put off until sunday. Only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. I thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. I can hear people talking out side. Normally I would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. I wish I had a laptop so that I could type this elsewhere, and I think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. I wish I could go to the game saturday, but I didn't get a ticket. Last week's game was really exciting. Only one more minute. I just wish this were over with. I can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. I can hear music playing in the next room. I wish my stereo system was that loud. 
__label__label1 I wonder if I still have time to turn in my books to get a full refund. if I can't then its going to be pretty bad. I'm definitely not going to type correct grammar and punctuation on this paper. I mean does my brain think in grammar. nope. its thinks how I talk. PROPNAMEs song is really loud on his computer right now. I remember that I used to hate this song when I first heard it but now its good. I really don't want to read my chemistry chapter. think about kumchev. his class is pointless to go to because you can't understand what he is trying to say. I keep on seeing the time counting at the top of the screen but I'm trying not to look at it. its probably inevitable though. if you see something like that and you tell yourself not to look at it its basically guaranteed. that is a funny word. why is there weird spellings in words. this guitar part in this song is really crazy right now. I'm trying so hard no to look at the timer. its killing me. what a fun game this is. ok time to change songs. I wonder what the heck jackie thinks about me. I wish she would just open up and not hold back. what the heck is she so afraid of. PROPNAME PROPNAME is really crazy looking. I hope I don't fall asleep in art today. this is an awesome assignment. I love this crap. I used to do this in english when we were supposed to be writing rough drafts for papers. why do teachers monitor kids work in class. what if I don't want to do it in class. mrs waggoner was the worst ever. what the heck was her problem. I love this guitar part right here. I wonder what song is playing on joels computer right now. I think it might be the counting crows or somebody like that. I think I might go insane trying not to look at the clock up top. I wonder how much time has passed. probably like three minutes. ok I was just drumming on the space bar. I love drumming. playing the ir guitar is probably the best though. it looks awesome when you see people that are playing it as they are walking. its funny. I just like how many crazy people there are here in austin. I just want to become a rockstar. and I really want to go surfing with jackie right now. what a cool chick. that matchless amp really didn't sound that good now that I think about it. I would go fender twin all the way. that carbon fiber guitar was awesome and so was that acoustic amp. I really need to get my guitar fixed. haha. we play in like two weeks and I don't have one that works. I love thinkin about that. I wonder what I'm going to do. there is no use worrying about it though. it will all work out. I don't understand why people worry. the odds are that you what you worry about will be ok. and even if something really bad happens you don't think that you will be able to deal with it. but it you will so why worry at all. I think my mom is the biggest worrier that I have ever met. I don't see how she could waste her life doing it. wooaahh. a duck noise just came on my computer. I remember fred. he was a cool duck. I had a duck in my dream the other night. how random is that. I wish I was telepathic. how awesome would that be. that would be the best ever. I wonder how much time has passed now. its really crazy trying not to look at the clock. I wonder if I should run tonight. I probably need too. this is one of the best solos I have ever heard. I wonder if joel is going to work out tonight. I hope so because I want to run but I can't make myself if someone does not go with me. queen is a weird band. I wonder what songs our dj next class. that would be a fun job. I think it would be funny to play some crazy songs on. I wish that I could do really crazy stuff in class. like throw books at people. I don't want to hurt em but think about how funny it would be to see some just lose it. and like fart really loud when everything is quiet. I think that would the ultimate. I wonder what I made on my calculus quiz. probably a hundred because I'm a genius. 
__label__label0 I am sitting here on the hardest chair known to man. Even with a seat cushion its still not comfortable. My roommate is talking to her boyfriend on the phone. They talk forever. They never discuss anything interesting either. Speaking of boyfriends, I miss my boyfriend. I am going to be really busy this week and I am worried that I won't be spending enough time with him. I have an application to fill out for a girls' group called the ORGNAME ORGNAME. It sounds fun but I am worried that maybe its not quite me. "  The girls are really obsessed with each other and I never get along that well with girls. Girls usually hate me. I think because they're jealous and also because I am pretty intimidating. PROPNAME PROPNAME probably hates me the most. I wish she would get over herself. God she is a bitch. It makes me insecure when PROPNAME's ex-girlfriends are always still calling him, IMing him, and text messaging him. I trust him but its hard not to be bothered by it. I hope we stay together for a long time. I love him a lot. Geez its freezing cold in here. I think I get abnormally cold. I can't handle temperatures that are less than 00 degrees. PROPNAME and Chance are talking about getting married. but not to each other. I wonder if they will marry each other? I bet they will. what a boring couple they are. I think I'm too harsh on PROPNAME. I always judge her but then again she judges other people all the time. She is very racist. She hates our asian suitemate because she smells. But it is true. she always stinks up the bathroom. This is the easiest assignment I have ever done but it does kinda suck because its time consuming. I am tired and tired of school. I wonder if I should stay in business. I don't think its totally "me. "  But then again I don't even know what is "me. "  I only know what I'm good at. I don't really know what I even like. I think I think too much about the future. I always over-analyze things too. I can't help it. I'm a perfectionist. at least I want to be perfect. It seems the harder I try the less perfect I become. Does that even make sense? My back hurts. I'm trying to sit up straight so I have good posture and so I don't have to feel my fat rolls on my stomach touching. I wish I was skinnier. but I can't say I'm totally unhappy with my size. I wish my hips weren't as wide and my tummy was a little flatter. Yeah. dropping 0 pounds would be really nice. My face is starting to break out again. If there's anything that has been a huge pain in my life its my skin. It affects so much of my life and attitude. I thought the birth control was helping. maybe its just stress. Yes, I am very stressed. I have not had time to breathe since school started. And I know its only going to get busier. Sometimes I wish I could just escape. freeze time and come back without it costing me anything. My fingers hurt. And I'm still cold. I'm slumped over now, I give up on the posture and fat rolls. I feel guilty that my family misses me so much and I don't miss them. I really don't. Not even my sister PROPNAME. which is a surprise. I thought I would at least miss her. but I don't. I should call them tomorrow. Maybe my mom could help me with my lonestars application. I have so much stuff to do. I'm scared. Why am I so touchy feely emotional lately? I used to never think of myself as emotional, but I think ever since I started dating matt I have become much more emotion oriented. I think I have become more insecure too. That does not really make sense though. But its like now I have to please him too. One more person to impress. before it was just myself and kinda my parents. but mostly my competition. I'm very competitive. I think of everyone as my competition. I bet that is unhealthy. but then again. what is healthy? I can't think of a single person I know that is "healthy" or has "healthy relationships. " I am almost done now. I'm just waiting for the clock to wind down so I cna start on yet another homework assignment. oh joy! I wonder why matt has not called me back. I need him to lift my spirits and to talk to. He is really wonderful. is that normal that I'm so obsessed with him? 
__label__label0 So yesterday my boyfriend from ORGNAME came down to LOCNAME to celebrate our 0 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 00 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 0,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from LOCNAME, which was so pretty, and LOCNAME isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it. But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone. I don't even use any other phone. I am always on it. I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells. I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do. Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely. I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type. But then my mind goes blank for a second. I never really thought I was a good writer. In fact, I thought I was horrible. My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class. It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class. I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well. It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else. My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester. I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate. I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature. 
__label__label0 A steam of cousiness paper is kind of a weird thing to do, but in a way simple. At the moment all I can do is think about this paper and the impression I am going to make by putting down what I have to say. Will I sound smart, dumb, or  am I completely doing the wrong thing. Oh well I guess there is not to much I can do about it now. I almost waited until the last minute to do this and I was afraid that the system might be backed up or something, just like the prescreening survey. Wow!!! I waited until the last minute to do that and I was sitting at me computer for just about 0 hours. I guess that proves I procrastinate pretty often. Sometimes when events like this happen I try to fix the problem and I do good for awhile. For example I won't but things aside and and do things sooner than later, but after about a week, I am back to my old habits. Today I actually got stuff accomplished, but then ageing I didn't because, here I am a couple of hours before this assignment is due, trying to complete it. I am hoping that my internet connection won't crash or some other phenomenon, such as bad weather, won't affect me turning in this assignment. Thing of bad weather made me thing of all the unfortunate events that have happened due to the hurricanes in the LOCNAME area. Bad weather, such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, is something that really frightens me. I think it is really a big fear of mine. When I hear that a tornado might be in the area, automatically, I thing the worst and am afraid for my life. I guess I just wouldn't want to go that way. Although its not a popular way to die, like cancer or drunk driving, its just scary to thing about. But after all the destruction in LOCNAME there haven't been to many deaths reported, a lot more than there should have been. This is a very serious topic and never thought it would take me to this. I just hope the situation clears up soon and the areas recover as soon as possible. Recovery can sometime be the hardest thing to cope with and get through and that goes with any kind of recovery. Such as when you get in a wreck and have to recover from that or even recovery from a long night of partying and drinking. That requires a different type of recovery. my fr      
__label__label1 As I am writing this, the ORGNAME ORGNAME are playing the A's. I think this really may be  the year for the ORGNAME. I hope so because how cool would it be to see the "Curse of  the Bambino" broken. Their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing  the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching. They look like  the 0000-0000 ORGNAME. I'm ready for a World Championship for my Sox. I just read an email from home, from my Dad. I miss him, just having someone  around to talk to. I guess I am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad  that I do, most guys don't. I mean, not many people have  the kind of Dad who  taught them how to play sports and things like that, but I have vivid memories of  being 0 and 0 years old and my Dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the  ferry. With football season starting, I really realize how much I miss the game. I mean,  it's been 0 years since I DIDN'T play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting  hard. I miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of Friday Nights,  being the Captain. I miss D a lot too. we had such a crazy fall last year, always  know that we should be together but never being able to get it right. I miss 0th  periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking. I miss Saturdays, the days  after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with PROPNAME. I've  been gone 0 weeks, and I'm not homesick, I'm just kind of missing the Crew. I miss  PROPNAME a lot. For 0 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and I  really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that I am one of the biggest  things in her life too. Which is good, because I really cannot see either of us  drifting away from the other. I hope PROPNAME is doing ok. I'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him. He  really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention  for being the "Big Guy", the built guy. a school like this would be terrible for his  self-esteem. But oh well, whatever floats your boat, right?  I really hope PROPNAME does ok. that kid has never been in a social group or circle  that I didn't bring him into. He may really struggle with finding his niche at school. I  hope not thought, he's my best friend and I need him to be self-confident and  happy so I can stop worrying about him. I can never really tell if worrying about  people is a good thing or a waste of time. I worry so much about PROPNAME, with her  mother walking out on her and everything. and PROPNAME is so reclusive when it  comes to her emotions, even to me. it betrays her every once in a while thought,  when I have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a  basic human reaction/emotion out of her. I hope D is doing ok. being the only one of LOCNAME not to go to college has to take it's  toll on her. but from what she says, she is getting her act together. I just couldn't  take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy  as PROPNAME. thank God she's finally going in the right direction. Maybe I won't have to  live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road  somewhere. Of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me. Going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does  making me feel satisfied that I AM having an impact in someone's life. or, a lot of  someone's. I really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that I invest so much  of myself into those people. and I really believe it has paid off. My family seems to being doing well. I'm glad. The girls will be back in school  soon, and next year PROPNAME will be in my position. That's crazy. Go Sox. 
__label__label1 o. k, so now I'm writing for this assignment. I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order. I like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. I'm probably more into that than most people I know. I wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. I totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was "bamn" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home. I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place. but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that. I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a "how are you" exchange. things are going better with my parents and I. there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things. probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy. anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob PROPNAME type stuff. I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. I wish I was done now. funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process. it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days. I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and I am somewhat. wish I had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes. I wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and "treated". I have avg acne, not really the worst I've had. I am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which I assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because I told her that I would clean it last night because I went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason I like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. I have a good view from the office room where I am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that I noticed that, I noticed I'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to PROPNAME gym and how I can't really yet because I am a gimp. Not really though, I could easily tough it out, I'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. I knew I'd miss high school for that reason. I like when I repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when I typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. I was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than I had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something I don't really want to do again, or do I? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished. 
__label__label1 I feel cold, my toes are really brittle feeling, I want to get in my bed right now, it is so warm in there, I feel closest to home went I am under my covers trying to sleep, the best feeling ever in the world is being really cold and then jumping into a warm bed that is what I want right now, if my new dorm wasn't so cold I wouldn't be rambling about this topic but wow is it cold although I do enjoy is freezing at night during the day I wouldn't mind a little heat I mean come on now at camp all summer it is so warm I just want to burst every time I walked outside I got that amazing warm sensation over my whole body I remember it so clearly that thawing feeling well I who'll get my hopes up here I am now in college in the cold away from friends and family and camp but I shouldn't feel so isolated sitting in this cold and unhomely room well I should this place is absolutely depressing ha-ha that is so funny how in class we talk about depression and more sleep is associated with it and I totally know that I will be napping after this assignment but no really college is the time of your life or so I am told but so far my two weeks at ut have not been the greatest of my life but then again I have herd stories about people coming here and not liking it for awhile and then they magically start to have fun this is not a cry for help by the way you know the one you warned us about not writing because it would not be read well that is not what this is I am just thing about me and how different I am it is strange the qualities I posses I always think that I am unique and different but there are a million people out there one has to be like me but the more I think about myself the more I am convinced that there is absolutely no one else like me on one side I feel lonely but realistically I love my friends because of the differences between us I feel like all I have is me with your best friends you can tell them anything in the world about how you are feeling and you can trust them and now all those people are gone and when I talk to them on the phone it is just not the same and we seem to be growing a greater distance apart wow I just realized what a sob story this is this is not a cry for help at all what roommate just walked in and totally broke the sob story train I mean he is a nice guy and all and we will get alone fine and everything for a whole year but I definitely don't think that we will be best friends or anything and I really am not going to make a conscience effort to befriend anybody I am quite satisfied all by my self in this way I am really different I mean yes all people need to belong to the group and have friends and fit in but I think that I just have I stronger resistance to such social things as that besides a lot of people have told me that they were never friends with their roommates but that they did have a lot of fun with them so maybe I should be more open to the idea of hanging out with the guy even though he reminds me of a phony awe PROPNAME cawfield I can't say phony without thinking about PROPNAME cawfield from catcher in the rye I really shouldn't have read that book at the age I did it turned me on in weird ways and I don't think I understood 
__label__label0 Wow, Its the end of another week ,and finally I get time to relax . My idea of relaxing isn't partying or drinking. My idea of relaxing is sleeping. Yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind, is my favorite hobby. My roommate is reading what I'm reading so I had to halt before I continued typing. There's another friend in my room and he's laughing at what I just wrote. He shouldn't be reading other people's thoughts! Wow 0 minutes over already. I got 00 minutes left . I'm just feeling really light right now. Light in the head. I can't think of anything to write. This is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment. It's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again. Tomorrow's Saturday and Saturday means another football game for UT. I couldn't go for the first game, because I didn't have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package. My roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now. So basically I'm doing two things at a time-typing and listening to music. Some people can study with music playing, I still haven't tried studying with music playing in the background. Maybe I should try it out sometime. I think it is important to knock before you enter a room. But that just doesn't happen in Jester. One of my friends just barged in, and I jumped in my seat. This is crazy. I should tell him not to do that again. I'm not that fastidious actually. But certain things annoy me. The things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being, so I know I'm not a freak. I have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week's events. It's been a great week. My chemistry test went well. I really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester, so I can get some kind of scholarship. I don't want my father to pay so much for my education. He doesn't grumble or anything, but I just feel guilty. I know that I have to work extra hard because I have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like Stand I must make good use of this advantage I have over other people. I'm loving it here. I came to LOCNAME exactly a month ago. Wow I should be celebrating today. It's been a month in the LOCNAME LOCNAME. This stupid friend is irritating me, Wish I could ask him to leave, I can't concentrate on my thoughts. He's asking me why I type with just two fingers. God. I'm going to tell him to mind his own business. I better change the topic . Or he might read this ,and get annoyed and abuse me or something. Yeah but making friends has been tough. I haven't made too many friends. My roommate is my best friend  as of now. I couldn't have asked for a better roommate. We just get along really well. Today at Chemistry class I met another Indian girl. She was from LOCNAME . She was basically an ORGNAME -American born confused Desk. Desk refers to Indians Ok my 00 minutes are up so I'm going to sign off now. I'm going shopping with my friend PROPNAME, right now. I'm going to the Target store. Then I've got to come back and do my laundry. Ok. I'm going. Bye. Writing this assignment has been great. Thank You 
__label__label0      well, I wonder why I'm here. languages can be a real problem especially when you have 000 pages to read every day. Maybe this is what people called college live. no time, no entertainment, no nothing. maybe it's not the case for native students!  so why am I here?  Am I anywhere better than them?  Or will I ever be better than this advantaged people?  what advantage will I receive once I finish this college hell?  hell with it. It's not so bad actually. maybe. I don't know. There are so many things I want to do, but don't have time for. I have to fit into the class room, so I got to read the textbook, pretending that I'm cool with it. Who knows how I'm doing?  I don't even know that. Sometimes I wonder what will come after. After all this years of staying and trying to fit into a culture that I don't even like. Is it money that draw me here?  Or is it something else?  Maybe I'm just tried of what I used to do. Although I don't know exactly what. Live repeats itself, again and again that I don't know whether I've done it already or it's just a similar experience. Memories are tricky. They fool you, mislead you, and abandon you. Am I here for the 0nd time? Or even more than that?  What am I searching for?  Trying to reach a perfect life?  I wonder how many times more do I have to live in order to achieve that. Enough for the questions. since there will be no answers to that. PROPNAME is a nice place. The weather is quite similar to LOCNAME, but not as humid. People are busy, as they did in community college. but the more people there are, the easier you fall into isolation. I don't remember when I get my first "friend" in college, but people seemed more relaxed back then. Memories make things look at its best. That's how human survives. Cell phone is also a devise that's supposed to do so. But do they?  People get more and more dependent on such thing. They want to be connected. but with whom?  What's the meaning of saying hi on the phone and trying to find a correct time to hang up though out the conversation?  Cell phone is tiring. They only work when you need to be picked up. There lots of quite Asian girls on campus; I wonder where they're from. Are they having the same troubles?  I don't see any good looking Asian guys out there. Too bad, it's always easier to find good looking girls than guys. Well, as long as it nurture my eyes. Not being able to see good looking things can be a torture!  That brings me to another problem in LOCNAME. No comic book store!!!  And I can't even watch the DVDs I brought. Damn capitalistic Americans. Region settings is plane stupid. 
__label__label1      this is the weirdest thing I have ever had to-do. right now my roommate is watching the graham PROPNAME effect and it is hard to concentrate. the show is really funny. he just changed the channel I am going to ask if could turn it down a little. Yesterday I had a really good date. it is all I can think about today. I hope things turn out good because I don't want to be hurt. I went to the gym today. I like and dislike working out. I like the end result and the feeling after working out, but I hate the feeling before I have start working out. I want to go out tonight. I don't have class on Fridays so I feel obligated to go out and do something. I got some people to go salsa dancing. nobody has really confirmed f they're going or not. I kind don't want to go anymore, but since some people already said yes I have to go. I am sure I will have tonight. this is really strange. I am just spilling out random thoughts. I really like the guy I went on date with. Well I don't know if I like him or if I like the idea of being with him? I guess time will show. I am tired of being single. I want a boyfriend! I was at the gym and I felt for some reason really aroused. I usually don't get aroused at the gym but today I saw a really hot guy that I couldn't get out of my head. I wonder if that is  BAD THING to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys. I know it is perfectly normal but I would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to. maybe that's why people think I am whore. I m really sexual. I am really worried about getting in the communication school. I think about everyday. if I don't get in I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I just had dinner by myself. I hate eating by myself. I think it is because I had no friends when I was growing up. I have friends now but tend to want them around to much. I want to have sex I hope ya'll don't read this because are going to think the worst of me, but at the same time I don't what anybody thinks of me. for the most part. I keep looking at the clock to see how much time I have left. I hope I am doing this right because if I am not than I will be really mad. my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes. he was just over my shoulder reading this. I told him not too and then he stop. he is watching Seinfeld now I wish I could enjoy the show right now. Wait no he is watching the king of queens. my mistake. I can concentrate now because I don't like that show. I have a lot of pretty friends. 
__label__label1      This summer has been such a burden on me. I am dwelling in it and it is eating me up. I don't know why exactly we broke up I just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected. I find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me. I just can't seem to let it go. It might be because we were together for so long and go so close. She was the best person PROPNAME had ever put in my life. We seemed to click, it seemed so perfect, and she told me she felt the same. She told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes. She was scared. She told me I meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her. She had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me. Something she hadn't let herself do with anyone else before me. It felt so right. I was at such a high, life was so good. I was happier than I had ever been. I became so dependant on her for happiness. I know that is something that was unhealthy, but she had gotten just as dependant on me. We had so many plans for the future. We planned out every step of the way. Factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school. Everyone is telling me to move on, but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us, for me not to let her go. She wanted to get through this hell or high water. Nothing was going to tear us apart. During the summer we got closer than ever. We had many plans for the summer. We bought tickets to concerts. Then she went off to camp. She said nothing was going to happen at camp. Four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me. What the hell happened at camp. I go to Warped tour and she with someone else. All I can do is give her a hug and say "Nice pick over 0 feet tall and blonde, just like I said. " Seeing as I was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same description. Later she calls me and tells me it wasn't what it looked like. I blew up on her. It was a normal reaction. Everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring, and then BANG, everything comes crashing down. Everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there. And I completely defended her. Cause I knew her better than anyone else, not only my thoughts but hers as well. She was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past. Every male figure in her past had let her down, and she couldn't comprehend someone loving her as much as I did. So because all the idiots in her past, I have to be let go because she can't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together. Why did she have to go, we were happy. I don't know what happened at camp. It was more than seven weeks ago that I talked to her. I called this week and left a message she didn't return. I called again today. She picked up we talked for 00 minutes and 00 seconds. She seems perfectly happy, just as free as a freaking butterfly, not caring at all, it seems, about what I am feeling. How is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and I'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable. Is everything that has happened a game to her. I don't understand how I can move past this. I can't. I don't what to do. I gave her everything. And it feels impossible to get it back. I still love her more than I love anyone, including myself. All I can do is sit and write songs about it. 
__label__label0      It is interesting to note that when I work on something in my head, I always forget what the details were unless I write it down. One thing I do remember though, are the feelings. I feel like what I had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability, particularly in math. With this I acn create a continuation, or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge. This would help me learn a lot more on my own, rather than starting over as much as I do on particular problems. The only problem is I do not know how to keep a good organized notebook, rather I havjust not done it yet. I can keep things very well organized when I want t, but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do. I wish I could find a way to ake a lot of things easier. Speaking of which, I always make things easier in math. I always say that I am so good at some things because I make those things much easier than most people make them. I do this because I am lazy. Simply put, I work on something to make it easier for me in the future. Ultimately I get easier work tat way, so I am a lazy, yet slightly thoughtful person. Thoughtful in the way of thinking, not as in the consideration of others. Well my roommate walked in the room, so my stream of consciousness is screwed. So hi!! Well, anyways what was I talking about?stuff. Ohhhh my laziness. That's a long subject. I am very lazy, but I really need to work on my laziness. I am trying to do this, my mental laziness is not very bad, but physically I don't do as much as  I like. So, I guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing. I am going to try flag football this semester. and I REALLY want to play ping-pong (a. k. A. table tennis, as I  should probably start calling it). I was a little. Ok very. upset when I lost so many times the other day, I don't normally play as bad as I did that night. I just used a contraction, I was told not to use those in formal apers so I try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment, or even when talking o frieds, apparently I did not follow through with that a few moments ago. Well, other than that I am kind of at a loss on what to write. I am very hungry now, probably has something to do with the food I am smelling. I wishi could gain some weight. Which reminds me, I used to go around saying how much I wanted to be fat, but I quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that. My hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep. My eyes are shutting too. Not good when I have 0 minutes and 00 seconds left. Oh well . I want to go eat now. I have a lot of homework tonight. I won't get to do anything fun, I won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, I may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? No its not. ( I used that contraction again). . And I forgot the apostrophe, haha. Anyways college is supposed to be hard. So, I should probably enjoy working on homework 0 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while I do laundry, and then on the weekend nights I get time to play ping pong and be with other PROPNAME's Scholars people and play intramural football with them. Speaking of which I played ultimate frisbee the other day. Err I mean yesterday. It was great, It was good to have some more physical activity in my life. I scare myself cause my abs. Well, where I should have abs at least. Still hurt from limbo three days ago. Also my legs hurt to. My roommate just said scrotum. I have no idea why. Scares me a little more . Just thought I would let you know that. He is nuts, I guess I should go back to what I was tlaking about earlier. Food. Haha, I wonder how many words I can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause I am getting very tired right now, that and I am not punctuating very well, and I am using contractions without the apostrophe's. My roommate just reminded me of PROPNAME PROPNAME. Funny man!!! You should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious. I am talking as if there is someone going to read this. Oh, only a minute and a half left. My eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen. Man, I am Hungry. !!!!! heh, I just looked at the time and it said 00 00, reminded me of 0:00, I see that all the time, or at least I used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then I got hurt and it no longer showed up. 
__label__label1 I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words, but of deeds. Better days through better ways. That's all of the Creed to the ORGNAME I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times. I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 0 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income. I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic. I will say that by typing, my spelling improves. My hand writing is horrible. I can bearly read the things I write. I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them. Man, this room is hot. I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot. I want to take guitar and speed reading classes. Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement. Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now. I supose the speed reading class might be. I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot. I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it. My memmory has been getting worse daily. Not just because of the alcohol consumption. I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school. I'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately, and I think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better. My girl friend of over a year and a half and I broke up a couple weeks ago, but continued to date. The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people. I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 0 weeks and see how that goes. She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too. She still has the comanionship of her 0st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side. One of which is the same age as my 00 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place. I feel this pain inside me I've never felt before when I hear her talking about going places with him. But like my roommate says, there's nothing like a good jam secion. He's talking about music, but I want to jam with some other girls. Get my mind off of her. I know that the migranes and headaches are from her, and that she really is being selfish most of the time, and she's not really my "type,"  if there is a type for anyone. But I find myself unable to stop thinking about her. I met another girl the other day who has more incommon with me than anyone I've ever met. She's beautiful and got into UT. That means brains and beauty. She's just coming off of a break up from her long time boyfriend through high school as well. My main hesitation about persuing her is that I don't want either of us to mentaly, or physically, get involved just because we think we need someone at the moment. Besides, I think she's too active for me. she's the social director of her sorority. Another thing that's been stressing me out is the fact that my cholesterol is 000, and my LDL (the bad kind) is 000, higher than most people's total. The doctor told me I needed to get on medication as sooon as possible and gave me sample packages that should last me atleast a month to be sure I had time to get my perscription filled. My first thought was to get a second opinion about the medication, but I feel confident that any doctor would tell me the same thing. I would tell someone the same thing and I don't have a degree. But I can't convince my self to take it. No studies have been done to document the sideeffects of the medication on someone as young as my self. When I asked the Doctor about them, she said that I should just take half the recomended dosage and I should be okay. I decided against the medication and I've drastically changed my eating habbits, althought I didn't think they were that bad to begin with. I've never been out of shape persay, but I can tell my body's getting back into shape. I used to be very fit, but after quitting high school sports my junior year, I began to slack off. And I found the girl that I just recently broke up with, so doing workout stuff didn't compare to her. I think I'm going to start running soon. I'm lifing now more then I get my cardio up, and while it's helping my muscles get back to looking right, I don't think it's giving me the help that I need. We, the people in my apartment, have decided, because of me, to each by their own groceries. I was tired of paying for all the stuff they eat when I wouldn't have any of it. I was buying all my stuff extra anyway, and they still wanted me to pay 00 bucks a aweek for "community food"  looks like my time is up. Adios         
__label__label1 So. I am overwhelmed. I wouldn't say that I'm completely overwhelmed and feel like crying, but I feel a little stressed out. I am not used to all this studying and it's proving to be a little harder than I thought. So much reading. It seems like it will never end. I feel like I will never be caught up. I have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math. I was worried about math but so far, it's my easiest class. Well, I guess it's good that it's not hard too. My classes aren't really difficult but there is just so much reading. I'm scared about the first test that I will take. I'm afraid that I'm going to make a really bad grade and maybe even fail it. I would be devestated. So, I'm trying to study a lot. It feels like I am studying a lot but I guess I won't know if it's all sufficient until that first test. Man, this is going pretty slow. It's only been three and a half minutes. Only 00 more to go. Well, this is the easiest writings that I've had to do so far. Just write exactly what is going through my head. Can't be that hard. Me and my roommate had our first disagreement last night. I promised her that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette at this party and then she caught me taking a drag. I felt really bad about lying to her. Yeah, I was drunk but it was still wrong. So, this morning I told her that I was really sorry and blah blah blah. She said that it was cool and everything but I don't want it to change our friendship. I still want her to be able to trust me. I know that it's just a stupid little fight but it really scares me that she might never trust me like she used to. I guess that it will all work out for the best. I love LOCNAME so much. It's an awesome place to be. There are so many good places to eat and shop and just look at. My home town only has about 0000 people in it. So Austin is a good change for me. But I do miss my parents and my bed and my shower. Man, these beds in Jester suck. I wake up and I'm sore. So, I hurt my ankle pretty bad about a week ago. We're suing the 0-00 that I tripped at because they handled the situation really badly and treated me very rudly. My roommate, PROPNAME, was awesome throughout it all. I really couldn't have done it without her. I'm glad that we don't hate eachother. But I hope that I get some money from the 0-00. It would be nice to be able to pay for an apartment next year with out having to get my parents to pay for it. They have 0 kids in college at the same time so it's going to be a tough year for them, financially. PROPNAME treats guys really weird. I would say, wrong, but it's just different than I treat guys. She's so wishy washy and is like cheating on all of her boyfriends. It kind of bothers me but if that's the way she is, I can't try and change her or preach to her about how I think she should be acting. Man, if my other papers were this easy to write, I would have so much more time on my hands. I'm only taking 00 hours, so I feel like a slacker. The thing is that if I were taking any more, I think I might cry a lot more. When will the reading ever end?!?!?! Only 0 more minutes to go. Wow, this is easy. Our dorm room used to be freezing cold but I taped some paper over the vent which made it a lot better. It's pretty ghetto looking, but it works. I haven't been able to exercise for a long time. I have to wait until my ankle is better. I can't even wear tennis shoes yet! Man, I feel so lazy and fat when I don't work out. Exercising makes me feel good! Damn that 0-00! And I bought a Texercise pass too! I'm losing some money there. I have handicap parking but it runs out on Wednesday. It's been really handy! PROPNAME, that's a word that my ex-boyfriend made up when he was in 0th grade. I've tought it to a lot of people here and everybody loves to say it. It makes me so happy when I hear my new UT friends say it because it reminds me of the good things about home. And it reminds me of PROPNAME too. So, I love to hear a good ole' bont every once in a while. The girls next door are really loud sometimes and I don't think that they like me. They've been really bitchy so far and that bums me out because I like to get along with everybody. There is this guy a few doors down from me and he's really cool. We like the same music and movies and all that good stuff. He's kind of crazy though. But I like crazy sometimes. Aren't we all a little crazy? But he's not that attractive, he's kind of a big guy. But, I've seen pictures of him when he was in high school and he was really cute. It bothers me that this bothers me. I'm not the type of person who judges others, especially by the way they look. It's not even like I'm judging him. I just think that we get along really well but I would probably never date him and it bothers me to think that I'm that vain. But I'm really just rambling and none of this makes sense very much. I know how I'm feeling, but when I try to write it, it doesn't come out right. Oh well. At least I know what I feel. Or at least, I think I know.        
__label__label1      Well, I have to do this weird assignment for psychology. I think its neat, but kind of weird. that spoon full peanut butter was really good. I'm going to have to have some more later. the atkins diet is a bitch . even though you can eat all the protein you want. I still crave the bun on my buger. I was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room. god, I felt like such an idiot. then I went crazy looking for my  roommate PROPNAME cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and I Couldn't find her and I don't have her number memorized. I don't know. I felt stupid. I feel so fat. !!!! even though I'm not overweight at all I just feel fat . I have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time. I thinks obsessive compulsive or something. I feel like I always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place. I guess I always feel like I have to impress everyone. shut up PROPNAME, god she makes the most annoying sounds I've ever heard. anyway. yeah I just always feel fat. I think I way around 000 and I'm 0"0. I just want be a little bit thinner maybe 0 or 0 pounds lighter. well, I'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits, and I feel like I got to loose a few. they are awesome, but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we've just grown to be the best of friends. I'm only 00, and its weird cause one of them is 00 and the other is 00. I'm so excited cause I miss them a lot. I think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 0 hours to come and visit. when I went down a couple of weeks ago back home, they took me out to LOCNAME padre island and we all got wasted. I like it cause I can trust them and more importantly they can trust me. I have a little head ache right now. I wonder if it was the peanut butter. I hope not. I'm really thirsty. all I've been drinking is water cause of that diet. I just started it yesterday and I probably won't see any results till maybe in a few more days. I miss isaiah. I love him so much, but he's about 0 hours away and a senior in high school. I love him but the last time I went down I didn't feel the same love for him like I used to. maybe I'm just in love  with the image of him. I guess that can happen. I've been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person I am. I wanted to come to UT because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you. well, I still don't know who I am. I know that I'm sweet, kind, and talented, but there's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that I don't get into trouble. maybe everyone does that. I guess I'll never know. I 'm really glad that I have a good roommate. we are exactly alike and we get along really well. I just miss everyone from back home , but I know when pam and kristy come to visit me I'll feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and I m so in love with her music. I recently went to  a sarah mclachlan concert on july 00 this summer. now that was probably the best experience of my life. it was awesome. their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches, I think that's how you spell it. I 'm really excited to meet her cause she's hilarious. I spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and I haven't met her in person yet, but I'm looking foward to it cause she  said she likes having a good time and I'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together. I CAN'T WAIt!!!!0. I'm tired now. I haven't gotten any sleep since I'v been here, wow the times almost running out,,  
__label__label0      I don't want to go home. I have to take the stupid bus back to campus but I'm too lazy. I'm hungry but I already ate so much I'm gonan get so fat it sucks. no exercise and just food the perfect college experience. dude I'm bored there's nothing to do around here when you don't have a car. I want my car back I miss my baby can't wait until I go back to plano and nadia is pissed off because her stupid phone doesn't have service in her apartment and her apartment sucks. there's no cold water in the shower so I got burned like crazy this morning how am I going to take a shower tomorrow if there's no cold water and the maintenance people didn't fix it yet they're probably going to come tomorrow early in the morning and wake me up and they are screaming like stupid girls and I think shara just got hit in the boob. ha ha how funny. ok its just her leg. gosh we have no life. there's nothing to do aorund here. we just sit here and do nothing and they just scream and we;re going to get fat . I think we should work out. walking around campus is exercise I guess but it doesn't really do anything. I need to work out so bad but I'm too lazy and I don't know wat else to say . I dotn feel like goign to class tomorrow because there's no point in going to chemistry because all his notes are online and he doesn't really expand on it and its so boring and its a one and a half hour class and I want to sleep and I just sit there and stare at nothing its so retarded. I don't get why classes are so boring there's no point in taking a chemistry class if I'm going to be a business major and my friends are being so freaking loud and I can't concentrate and I don't know what I'm typing I'm not even paying attention. there's this girl who got in a car accident and the air bag blew out her eye and she's suing hte company or something I don't know. I think that's really cool. Sort of I don't know I'm runnign out of thigns to say and its only been about 0 mins. how can I do this for 00 mins its impossible I don't think that much. haha that just made me sound really retarded . I think someone in my friends freshman seminar is gay. she's so mean. she doesn't want to hang out with ditzes . don't know how to spell that. there's this grl in psych that wants to form a study group. I don't even know her and I don't my phone just rang and I and we just had a wing dinner and I didn't go and my roommate went to another wing and its so retarded. I don't really want to go and we'll going to get fat. I think my roommate thinks I don't want to stay in my dorm because I haven't been back there in like a week. she might think I don't like her or somthing and my wing advisor doesn't know me she asked my friend told me she asked if she was me. I'm runnning out of stuff to say why are we doing thing. Is there a point . don't htink tat was really smart to say but tats what I'm thinking and this is the assignment so I wrote it. my friends think all I think about is sex alcohol my suicidal lova with and an "A" and they're laughing at nothign its so weird. there are two lesbians on the bed behind me its kind of kinky. gosh this is so retarded. I hope you don't read this because I have no idea wat I'm saying. we are depressed. We realized today thanks to our psych class. all we do is eat sleep do nothing think about sleeping think about partying and doing stuff but we don't and we just sit and eat and do nohting. and htink about classes that we should go to but don't which is really bad since we;re paying for these classes . And now the stupid lesbians are asking each other how many fingers am I holding up and they think I have blonde hair because they found one one the bed. that shows how stupid they are. its probably nadia's because she's a total blonde on the inside and out. and now they're talking about this guys butt and how he wears really tight pants. and how they want their guys friends cloths and now they're imitating how their friends stand this is so stupid I have like 0 mins left and now they want to watch porn. we watched one the other night it was so funny. it was my first time like a few days ago and now they're talking about how we sleep. shara is always squishing me against the wall. And nadia like elbows me. O I have to get tickets for plano tm. Because I'm going back this weekend to see my friend whos leaving for harvard on Saturday so smart. and she just got her cartilage pierced today with my other friend. they're such wusses. They called me and were like freaking out and asking me if it hurt and stuff and I'm like. just freaking do it. And I told them not to call me until they did it. So they did. Took them long enought. gosh 0 more minutes. can't wait until I go to plano. Get my car and probably going to see some friends and hang out and stuff. Stupid dylan piss me off. Gosh why can't he just cooperate once in a while gosh. Its so stupid . I just don't understand him sometimes. nadia wants to put my hair in pigtails and she'll pay me to go to class like tat she said she'll make me dinner but she can't cook if her life depended on it. she made these intstant mash potatoe thngs and it came out wet and dry at the same time and it was kind of grainy and stuff. It was the grossest thing I have ever tasted . and she even screws up instant noodles. she doesn't add enough water and it comes out dry and salty. Ok only 00 mor seconds. just drag it out . Type slower . And now they're talking about their stupid eyebrows and how crappy a wax job it was and she keeps looking at it and tis  
__label__label0 What an evening!  I have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now I am in the worst mood. I went with my suitemate to pick up food from ORGNAME ORGNAME. Everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food. Then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size. Finally, we got our food, and it was right. We drove back to our dorm. The Castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage. I park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to. After ten minutes, I finally got my car in my assigned spot. When we were getting out, she grabbed the food and I grabbed the two drinks. We had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator. FInally, it came and we headed up to our room. I stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as I attempted to unlock my door. As I was doing this, I even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while I opened the door, but I just ignored because I thought I had them. I made it in the door successfully, but as I was going to set them down, I dropped both of them all over my area rug. Irate, I bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and I screamed how much I really wanted a soda since I haven't had one all week!  I knew I had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained. I proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized I had forgotten the detergent. All the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold. When I walked in to the laundry room, I whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as I type this, I can feel the bruise forming. I kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor. I slipped 0 times before making it to the machine. I was so mad by this time that I just decided to wash my rug without any detergent. Now, here I am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events. I get back in my room and the internet is not working!!  I realize that I am so sick of fighting with the Apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm. So now, here I am eating the soggy nachos that I paid 0 bucks for. All I can smell is the food, but now I'm really not hungry. You should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse. Their TV or radio is really loud and I can hear it from here. Oh geez, now they're knocking on my door. "Is your internet working?"  It just came back up a few minutes ago is what I told them. For a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst. Now I am thinking about the phone call I just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement. She did not offer me ANY words of advice!  "Things happen!" she said. Wow!  No kidding!!  I don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while I am writing this. I look around my room and all I can see is a big mess!  As of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question!  I'm seeing my WET school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks. WOW!! I think this is the worst mood I've ever been in!  My room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which I have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear. My suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room. It is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that I have back home!  He acts so funny sometimes. He thinks he is so hard to get when I know that when I go down there, he will come right back to me. He's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home. I was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now I am completely set back. Nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that I was supposed to do. My stomach is growling because I am so mad. It gets like this when things go wrong. I HATE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!!  My mom's words are ringing in my ears. "Things Happen!"  "I just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when I talked to you earlier!"  THen come my suitemate's words. "Chill out girl!  It's going to be alright!"  I don't think that will EVER happen at this rate! 
__label__label1      it is often very cold in the Fac the smurf lab especially they call it the smurf lab because it's a student microcomputer facility the acronym and its meaning both absurdly out of date. the computers are new and black the keys crunching crisply under my sore and tired fingers sore and tired from a 0 hour lab drawing three dimensional models in a computer, changing materials, trying to get travertine to stick to cool, airy software. a man comes in (a boy a man) and sits at the computer I usually use but couldn't because his stuff was there. he pulls a sandwich out of a bag, readjusts his hat, takes a slow bite of the sandwich and gets back to work chewing and biting calmly and contentedly as if preparing for a long night which will require nourishment of a complete sort. complete nourishment completed with a drink of some brownish liquid like all other brownish liquids we drink as humans nearly indiscriminately. 0 minutes four minutes of aching arms and hands nerve cells firing the table to my brain, the itch on my right cheek to my brain, the cool air of the place to my brain. I love to write. I love to think in written form, to read the words in my brain, to think nothing but print if I can manage it. Not just in a case like this as if I ever had a case like this - but in all of my life, my every day. My speaking to others has quotation marks around it, descriptive ways of describing what I describe. I always want to write discribe and I don't think I ever have until now because always my mind ( the silent one, the one that doesn't think in word sounds or print) my silent mind stops my hand and puts an e there because it's right, because I knew that from the beginning but the part of my brain that lives in kindergarten, brown bear brown bear what do you see? - tells me so. No it tells me iiiii iii aye aye aye eye eye eye but it's eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I live in an apartment on my own now I can barely get it out of my head because it was so beautiful when I moved in  bare clean white bright new and beautiful and I keep it so clean and I love that about the apartment and I love that about me. I love to keep it all perfect. any one in the world could walk in the door and other than my messy grammar of any one's and every thing's there would be nothing out of place. I could open the door to the world and there is nothing shameful lying about no dirty plates and cups no clothes on the floor no mess around the sink. It's all clean as I'd like my life to be and am so gradually making it. The separation of church and state - the separation of method and emotion. Somehow I now think of star trek - oh, vulcans. Those crazy vulcans. I loved the next generation but I could never stomach any of the other iterations- the other shows in the series. The next generation was so right - picard so venerable, so rarely stooping to kirks weaknesses or the others' stupidities. So french, so proud. they made this archae not anthropological finding of some skull of some ancient form of man (in real life, not star trek) and they goyt got some graduate student or artist or pro or whatever to make a cast and then cover it with skin and eyes and hair to recreate the face of ancient man and it accidently turned out to look like patrick stewart and everyone thought hey ancient man looked like patrick stewart and they said no it didn't it's just a mistake but it was a great funny mistake anyway. I think a lot about william and henry james. I just read portrait of a lady over the summer and then to read ab out william in the psych book was so great so great to think that brothers could accomplish noteriety in separate fields to think that greatness was inherited from their father but they still so outshone him. my father has a software company and employs a man named john stewart which I think of because of patrick. He (john) drives a brand new red car red what corvette that's it. a red corvette so new that at the corvette show they didn't have one and paid him to put it on display. did they pay him?  my ear itches. They used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me. The boy in the chair I usually sit in is thinking about me because I see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye. He eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine. so close to done and I loved doing this because I never write anymore. s 
__label__label0 Right now I am in my room trying to study. I really don't know how to study at all. I'm way behind in all my reading cause it's so boring. PROPNAME is printing something right now. I am so bored. I want to go home tomorrow, but I'm not done with my reading so I really can't do anything until I'm done with that. Plus I don't know whose going to pick me up if I could go home. PROPNAME said he was going to find a way to come and get me, but I don't know if it's possible. They said there is this race they are going to on Sunday and I really would like to go. Gosh this seem to be forever to type. I really miss my mom, but when I'm around she's always yelling at me. I don't enjoy my time with her. Every time we get into an agrument I feel bad afterwards cause I know she might not be around for very long. I love her so  much I just wish we can hang out and do what other family does and be happy. My sister is not talking to her right now because of what happen last week and I wish it never did happen. I would be aleast happier to talk to her everyday. She seem to always cry when I do talk to her. My life seem to suck comparing to all the other people. PROPNAME is standing here right now watching me type. Right now I'm looking around room. My roommate is making me nervous, she was looking at me type. I think we need to start cleaning our room cause we have books and stuff everywhere. I miss PROPNAME, he went back to califorina for the ORGNAME and he has not called me since the last time. It's been like a week. I've been feeling a little dumb around LOCNAME cause everyone seem to be so smart. Even my friend PROPNAME feel this way. Maybe I just don't belong here with all the smart people. I'm a poor person, and it just make it worst to see that most of the people that goes here are rich. They talked about how they are going to get a piece of land and build their house and have lots and lots of parties. I don't know if I can even afford a house right now. My mom lives in an apartment and she barely make enough to pay for all the bills. I feel like I'm using all her money going here. I love her so much. She's always been here for me even if we get in fights. My life would have been better if I have my dad around. He doesn't even seem  to care if I'm alive or not. He never sent us anything. The only thing that I get from him is a child support paycheck, which I don't really care for. I need money, but it always come  and go. And it sure doesn't make me happy. Homer really likes me but I don't know him enough to go out with him. Is that bad?  For some reason I still like PROPNAME, but he's just the type of person that want girls for sex. He wanted to take me home this one day, but I said no. I don't like people looking at me like I am a hoe, because I know I'm not a hoe. My mind is blank right now. To me life just seem to suck. Isrel seem to be a non commitment person, and I wish he was because I would like to go out with him and be with him.  I guess I just like the idea that   I like him and if we get together and get marry someday he would be able to support me and make me happy. My goal right now is to  do good in school and build a great career for myself and prove to my friend's that I can graduate from UT if I try my best. They keep on telling my that I'm wasting my money going to UT because it's much cheaper when I go at home. I just always wanted to go to UT and here I am  following my dreams.  I'm trying to find a job right now but it seem so hard. So many people are searching for jobs and I'm out of luck. I think I might switch my bank to bank one because they have free checking account and the one I have with bank of america isn't free. After this I need to start reading  all of my books I wonder how far I'm going to get before I decide to go do something again. I'm almost done I have less then a minute now. I really enjoy my psychology class. It's one of the best class I have here at UT so far. I just hope I'll do good. My goal is to do good and get into the nursing major. 
__label__label0 I REALLY ENJOY THIS CLASS. I CAN GET INTO IT AND NOT BE BORED LIKE MY OTHER CLASSES. THE CLASS THAT I HATE THE MOST IS MY CHEMISTRY CLASS BECALOCNAMEE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TEACHER AND I SONT UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT. MY MAJOR IS NURSING AND PRE-MED. I REALLY HOPE I CAN GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL SO I CAN BECOME A SURGEON. MY ROOM JUST LEFT TO HER LAB CLASS. HER NAME IS KATRINA BUT I CALL HER KAT. SHE'S SO AWESOME!! WE BOUGHT A FISH TOGETHER ON MONDAY. HIS NAME IS SENIOR SOL. OKAY!?! THIS THING JUST WENT BACK SO I CLICKED FORWARD ON THE WEB BROWSER AND MY INFORMATION WAS STILL HERE, BUT MY TIME STARTED OVER SO THAT SUCKS!!! I'M KIND OF WATCHING TV AND DOING THIS ASSIGNMENT AT THE SAME TIME, BUT MOST OF MY FOUCUS IS GOING INTO THIS. I REALLY MISS MY FRIENDS!!! ESPECIALLY THE FAB FIVE!! EMILY, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, ARON, AND SOID!! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!! I TALKED TO EMILY YESTERDAY ONLINE AND SHE'S ROOMING WITH ORGNAME AT ORGNAME AND SHE TOLD ME THAT PROPNAME IS GOING GREEK AND IS STARTING TO ACT LIKE A BARBIE DOLL!! I WONDER IF AS SOON AS I GO HOME IF ME AND HER WILL STILL GET ALONG!!?? HMM. WONDERS. I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM AND I DON'T THINK I CAN REALLY GET UP AND GO OR IF I HAVE TO KEEP WRITING?? I REALLY HAVE TO GO SO I'M GOING TO GO AND I'LL BE BACK SOON!!!. . . . OKAY I'M BACK! I HOPE THAT DOESN'T EFFECT ANYTHING BUT I THINK IT MADE UP FOR THE TIME THAT GOT ERASED. I'M WATCHING WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONARE NOW AND I WISH I COULD BE ON THAT SHOW BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT AND BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO BE ON TV AND MAKE MONEY AS WELL. IT'S REALLY COLD IN MY DORM ROOM AND I'M STARTING TO GET SICK. I REALLY MISS MY BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW. HE'S AT WORK THOUGH. HE GOES TO ACC AND HE'S A SECOND YEAR. I THINK IF HE WASN'T HERE IN AUSTIN WITH ME I WOULD GO CRAZY BECAUSE I WOULD BE HERE ALL ALONE WITHOUT FRIENDS OR FAMILY. HIS NAME IS REY AND ON THE 00TH. ITS GOING TO BE OUR 0 MONTH ANNIVERSARY. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIPS. MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE 0 MONTHS AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS OFF AND ON. THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH MY RELATIONSHIP WITH REY AND THAT IS THAT MY FAMILY STILL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM AND I THINK I SHOULD TELL THEM SOON. I REALLY LOVE HIM A LOT!! HE TREATS ME RIGHT AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT THAT WE DON'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. I TALK TO HIM EVERYDAY AND WE TRY TO SEE EACH OTHER EVERYDAY AND SO FAR SINCE I'VE MOVED HERE I DO SEE HIM EVERYDAY EVEN IF ITS JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I THINK THAT HE MIGHT BE THE ONE. HE TOLD HIS FAMILY ALL ABOUT ME!! AND SO FAR THEY APPROVE. ONE OF HIS COUSINS THOUGH SAID THAT SHE IS GOING TO THROW WATER BALLOONS AT ME BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. I ALSO MISS MY FAMILY A LOT BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THAT I MISS THEM BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE LIKE I TOLD U SO AND I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MISS US. MY MOM EMAILS ME AND CALLS ME EVERYDAY. EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT NECESSARY SINCE I HAVEN'T LIVED AT HOME SINCE JUNE SINCE I WAS ATTENDING SMU BUT SHE JUST STARTED CALLING EVERYDAY AS SOON AS I MOVED TO AUSTIN. MY LITTLE COUSIN PROPNAME THAT I MISS THE MOST AND I CRY EACH TIME JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM IS UPSET AND CRYS FOR ME BECAUSE HE DIDNT WANT ME TO MOVE AND HE NEVER SEEMS TO WANT TO TALK TO ME BECAUSE HE WANTS ME TO GIVE HIM A BETTER REASON THAN SCHOOL FOR ME MOVING. BIG BROTHER 0 JUST STARTED AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM, BUT A LOT OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THE GAME DISSAPOINT ME BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF BACK-STABBING GOING ON. I REALLY NEED TO READ FOR ME CLASS AND I NEED TO STOP PROCRASTINATING. I NEED TO GET ON THE BALL AND START STUDYING OTHER THAN DOING NOTHING AND WATCHING TV AND GOING OUT. I REALLY LIKE UT AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE.       
__label__label1 I'm tired, I just cleaned our apartment and now I'm tired. But I feel satisfied that I cleaned the whole place. My roommate is extremely messy and is hard to live with at times but I've known her for 00 years and I love her to death. Now my mind is being tracked to when we met at the baseball field when pur older brothers were at practice. PROPNAME, my brother is now is LOCNAME and I miss him a lot I think it hits me in waves. I wonder what it's like there, hot and rainy I suppose but I wonder if he misses us as much as we miss him. I think he probably does he just doesn't hank about it as much as we do. My boyfriend lives in College Station and I miss him too. It feels silly at times though to have this person you love and car about so much to have them so far form you let you still can keep close. Technology is incredible. I'm able to talk to PROPNAME once a month. He's in LOCNAME for goodness sake that's an ocean away. I talk to PROPNAME every day usually more then once. Now I'm getting hot, and I'm so thank ful the ac just flipped on. I find it hard to believe people were ever comfortable without the air conditioning. This summer at the camp I worked at we didn't have an ac in the cabin and I got used to it. I fact I would get cold when I was in the ac. But still the comfort of it is much better than without. I miss camp I miss my campers. It's the one place that I really feel at home way from home, I am so confident there. not that I'm not here I just have been there for ten years and have grown up there. All my best friends are there. Of course I have other good friends but there just f=something about living with someone for three months that gives you a new look at them . They learn your morning routine and you there's it  comfort thing because someone else knows you so well that they know how you wake very morning. I miss those guys. And it's not like I can't call them or even hang out with some but I don't. Isn't that strange that I love these people so much yet I don't call and hang out either them. Yes they call me and sometimes I don' t call them back because I'm nervous. Why?  I don't understand my strange want to be with people but my stronger want to be alone and watch TV and just do nothing. I need to start working out again, I t has been so long since I have I think I would have more of a desire to get up and go if I had more of a pep "I just worked out" kind of look on life. I really love PROPNAME PROPNAME. He had inspired so man people to get in shape and be healthy and support the fight against cancer that you just have to respect that. I also respect him because he had the same cancer my daddy beat. That was an awful time in my life. Freshman year found out that my dad has cancer. He's fine now but wow that scared me he wouldn't be here for so many things that he has seen it's incredible. Medicine is absolutely incredible. It makes me appreciate everything he does a lot more. Funny how even when he was going through all that awful stuff I was pretty unaware. My parents kinds kept us in the dark. Not like I asked but we just didn't talk about it. I feel like I really don't know what happen to him during those months except that he got better and now he's doing great. I wonder if he still thinks about it everyday or if he's let that terrible memory flee from his mind. Wow he is one funny man, he can say anything and I'll laugh but I guess that's how it should be. He should be my hero. I wish every girl had a daddy like mine I think the world would be a make more relaxed kin of place. He always makes every tense situation funny and more laid back. My mom is the opposite and I wonder how hey have been together for 00 years when they are so opposite . But I know she loves him and I think he loves her. He does he just doesn't always shoe it in front of us but I'm sure he does to her. He'll do really sweet stuff like on Valentines Day. I think she just needs to relaxes a bit and realize that not every situation needs to blown out of proportion. Wow that was really neat. 
__label__label0      Ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again. The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. I hope I don't misspell too many things. I am sniffingly so loud. I should go get a tissue. I never did learn how to type right on this thing. Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird. Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. I really wish I could concentrate for more than 0 seconds when I'm emotional. It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight. But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school. I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life. They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. Wow, LOCNAME tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails. I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. I think it's time to switch positions. Ah. Much better. Now my typing skills really stink. It's really hard to lay on the ground and type. Oh I have a laptop. That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC. I still can't get comfortable. The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. That's better. I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place. AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. Stupid back gives me problems all the time. I miss Dr. PROPNAME!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt. It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing. That might not make me look too smart. Oh, well. I don't want to go back and look at it. It would just take to long. God, my nose is still stopped up. My skin is drying out to. I need to wash my face and moisturize. I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  I had to retypr it like three times. You know for someone who is supposed to be smart, I am pretty dumb sometimes. I wonder if PROPNAME thought I was dumb in class today. I zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. I wish I could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe I could pay attention in class. But no. I have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. I seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. I was going to use a bad word, but I don't know if that would be appropriate. I wonder if it would affect my grade if I did write a cuss word. Is that how you spell cuss?  Maybe I should have just wrote curse. And why do I always have to fix the word just?  Every time I type just without paying close attention I put an extra j in between the u and the s. It makes me feel quite stupid. Time just ran out. I'm glad because I want to just go to sleep and forget about people  I will never have to see again. 
__label__label1      I am excited about being a columnist, not because I like the daily texan particularly, although I do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since I can go on to write for the ORGNAME or the statesman once I am out of college and I can get internships at newspapers during the summer so It will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, I'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, I don't know if I can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, I don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but I obviously can't leave them behind and I think I want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean I actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but I still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but I can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all I can do is leave my options open so I can make good decisions later, so basically all I can do is write as well as I can and make good grades, I don't know exactly how to do either but I do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means I need to go to the UTLC finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well I can do on my own, I'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, I'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as I love going to UT home games, an away game means that I can eat while I'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, I can watch it with whoever I want and I don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, I would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, I don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so I don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, I'm a little worried about what I look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot I can do about that before the next game but I'll do what I can, I'm bored with classes already, I havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since I am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so I can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more I do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, I've never lived by myself before and I havent lived away from home for that long, I've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since I don't live in a dorm anymore, I miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so I guess the solution to that is to get things done while I'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, I need to get some groceries, I don't think I know how to shop yet, I still havent made a grocery list longer than 00 items and that's not enough when I go to the store once a week at most, I'm sure things will get easier once I get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but I'm anxious to get to the point where I am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management 
__label__label0      The speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap. I only purchased them because there was a $00 mail-in rebate with them. It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow. I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other. My computer monitor is really small. It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes. College life is really not what I expected. I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to LOCNAME. I guess I just need to get acclimated to PROPNAME and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to LOCNAME as much as possible. Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable. Every one of my classes has over 000 people in them. This is a big change from my 00 people honors classes in high school. It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors. PROPNAME was really fun. I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous. Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly. I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done. Is this assignment done yet? No still 00 and a half minutes to go. This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness. I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 00 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence. I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something. I know this because my father appraised me of it. Just useless trivia I guess. I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy. But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on. The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well. I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page. Definitely not what I expected. I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had. Whew only 0 minutes to go. The printer next to me is running out of ink, which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket. You have to be thrifty in college that's for sure. My budget is $000 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 000. I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents. They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received. It felt good to make them proud. My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college. College sure is much different from high school. A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school. Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter. A lot longer than it seems like it really should. I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college. I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life. But until then, it's still hell. My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 00 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me. My one friend PROPNAME loves to just barge into my room. I played raquetball with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 0rd or 0th time to play it. None of us are really are that good. The lie detector test in Psychology class last time was cool. My hands normally get really sweaty so I'm sure I would have sent that sweat-o-meter off the charts, I wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot. 
__label__label0 well another week of classes has started and I can't wait until this weekend. I just want to relax for a while. there is so much to do during the week. I start on one thing then I have to work on something else. there is like ten million things to do. I am taking these hard classes and I hate them. I have to read a lot of course, but oh well. I have a quiz tomorrow in my Bio 000 discussion class. gosh I hope am ready. I really want to do well. its my first quiz. am going to be nervous. I did study some last night. I am extremely tired because I stayed up late looking over stuff for bio 000. I feel I am not fully prepared. but then I study so hard I go take the quiz and what if I fail. I hate that feeling. I study so much but then my hard work wont pay off. I feel so awful that I cry, I know crying doesn't do anything. but its just you work so hard and you want to do well. I am going to study some more tonight though. I want to go over to jester and go to the learning center for my calculus homework due soon. gosh so much to do today. right now am just tired and hungry. I ate junk food last night. the cafeteria was closed and I just didn't feel like going down to the strip by myself. I just always want someone there with me. I am scared though to walk on the strip by myself. maybe this weekend I will walk on the strip in the afternoon by myself. I want to go look at the stores and just walk and chill out. I am just stalk in this cubicle just putting my head into the books. its like I need to get out get some fresh air. its just am so stressed and I know I got too much to do its like I don't even have 00 minutes to just relax. there is so many things to do on campus and I want to join clubs and get to know some new people. I want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a Persian club. that would be fun. I want to meet some Persian people on campus since I am Persian too. its fun to meet someone from your own culture. you can relate to them and stuff. I just need to get out there and explore my possibilities. I need to join some clubs not just for writing in you resumes but for fun and to learn and explore and also to meet people who are also interested in the same things you are. I want to go to the medical field so I need to join some medical organizations. I am sure there are many of them. I am a biology major and now am thinking to change my major to psychology. I think psychology will be an interesting field. I talked to my cousin who recently graduated from medical school and she said it would be a great idea. I want  to do something that I am interested in and like to study. biology is hard but any subject is hard, but now the classes am taking I am just not having fun and its really stressing me out and I want to do something that I will enjoy. and I want to get into medical school. I am sure every person who applies to medical school like probably most of them are biology majors. I don't want to be a biology major. I want to stand out. I want to be different. I also think that if I don't get into medical school then what am I going to do with a biology major besides teaching and maybe working in the lab, but is it really what I want to do? if I don't get into medical school am sure there are many possibilities with a psychology major. I can go to graduate school and such and maybe be come a psychologist. I think that would be more fun and interesting. gosh all am thinking about now is how hungry I am, ha-ha. I didn't eat any breakfast this morning even though I have lots of junk food in the dorm room, that I can eat. I will wait another hour or so to go have lunch with my roommate. my next class isn't until 0000. so I have plenty of time until then. I am going to study some more for my quiz on tomorrow and maybe I will eat something to before lunch, because right now I am way too hungry. I am glad I have some food in here. its not healthy but I am just way too hungry. I want to take a nap too, but am not going to I will try to go to bed early tonight maybe. well see how long it will take to finish up at the learning center. hopefully I can be done by 0 or 000. I am going to leave the dorm around 000 or so, so I can be at jester by 0. I want to finish my calculus homework so I wont have to worry about it that much. I already got enough stuff to worry about and do. I just want tomorrow to be over with. after tomorrow's quiz I think I will be okay.
